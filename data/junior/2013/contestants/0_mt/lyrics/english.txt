The Start

Came into my life
Shining so bright
And now all is right
My dreams will be heard
My voice and my words
And I will rise

Cause I have this voice inside
That I don't want to hide
But people told me I can't do it
I know that I'll get through it
I know that I can make it
I'll reach for the stars

Right from the start
I felt it in my heart
I knew that deep inside
We'll never be torn apart
And if I dream it
If I believe it
I'll achieve it
I can make it far

Today will be the day
I am here to stay
And I won't be afraid
Keep my feet right on the ground
And I won't lose my sound
No, I won't look down

Cause I have this voice inside
That I don't want to hide
But people told me I can't do it
I know that I'll get through it
I know that I can make it
I'll reach for the stars

Right from the start
I felt it in my heart
I knew that deep inside
We'll never be torn apart
And if I dream it
If I believe it
I'll achieve it
I can make it far

Today will be the day
I am here to stay
And I won't be afraid
Keep my feet right on the ground
And I won't lose my sound
No, I won't look down

Cause I have this voice inside
That I don't want to hide
But people told me I can't do it
I know that I'll get through it
I know that I can make it
I'll reach for the stars

Right from the start
I felt it in my heart
I knew that deep inside
We'll never be torn apart
And if I dream it
If I believe it
I'll achieve it
I can make it far

Right from the start
Deep in my heart
I knew that I'll go far
Cause music is my love

And if I believe it
I will achieve it
I will reach the stаrѕ
