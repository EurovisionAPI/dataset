Heart of Belarus

Ripe currants, cornflowers in the field
I know every spikelet in my homeland
In the river, the sky is clear and glows to the bottom
There are many different things in the world, Belarus is one
Belarus is one, Belarus is one

Na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, how proud I am of you
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, native Belarus

My pure melodious Motherland
We are the best friends, Belarus and I
Who is more important to whom, I do not dare to argue
We are similar in everything, me and Belarus
Me and Belarus, me and Belarus

Na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, how proud I am of you
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, native Belarus

Fly in the spring, as geese arrive
You will see your sadness go away, and so will your sadness
If you hear the heart of Belarus
You will love Belarus forever

Na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, how proud I am of you
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, native Belarus

Na-na na-na
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, native Belаruѕ
