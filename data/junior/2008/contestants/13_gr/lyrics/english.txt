One night

One night you laughed at me, I remember it like it was now
Like a stranger, so indifferent you passed, spring rain
"Goodbye", they sow storms, that you would turn
Thoughts are melting weak, empty canvas

Dissolved within my dream
And the sadness doesn't stop

One night you laughed at me and the rain grows stronger
Your word like a year that passed, like a snowy landscape
"Goodbye", they sow storms, I'm alone again
Paintings make me bitter and my breath eases

Dissolved within my dream
And the sadness doesn't stop

Dissolved within my dream
And this silence never ends

One night you laughed at me and the rain grows stronger
One night you laughed at me and this silence never ends
One night you laughed at me and the rain grows stronger

One night you laughed at me аnd this silence never endѕ
