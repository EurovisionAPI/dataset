Send me an SMS

It's a long way from where you're
Now I'm here with my thoughts
It's a long way from where you're
It's heartbreaking, and it's counting days

I want to see those eyes full of sparkle again
I'll be back soon, please wait
I want to see those eyes full of sparkle again
For us and the world is small, don't forget me

Send me an SMS as soon as I wake up
To be sure, you want me to know
He monitors SMS before I go to sleep
And rest assured, I'll dream of you

On the other side of the world is me
But only for you here I come again
And in my mind, I'm counting it down
Every day and every hour

I want to see those eyes full of sparkle again
I'll be back soon, please wait
I want to see those eyes full of sparkle again
For us and the world is small, don't forget me

Send me an SMS as soon as I wake up
To be sure, you want me to know
He monitors SMS before I go to sleep
And rest assured, I'll dream of you

(Send me an SMS as soon as I wake up) Send me an SMS
(To be sure, you think I know)
He monitors my SMS before I go to sleep
And rest asѕured, I'll dreаm of you
