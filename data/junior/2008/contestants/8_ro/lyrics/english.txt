Save the Planet

Winter passed over him
It's spring again, here's a snowdrop
Flowers sprout on the plains
And thousands and thousands of butterflies fly around me

Wait, save the planet, stay
There's another hope, come on
It's still spring in May

Winter passed over him
It's spring again, here's a snowdrop
Wait, save the planet, stay
There's another hope, come on
It's still spring in May

Wait, save the planet, stay
There's another hope, come on
It's still spring in May

I, sun, please something
Leave in your care
Winter with snowflakes
Autumn with rusty leaves

Golden and late
Wait, wait, wait

Wait, save the planet, stay
There's another hope, come on
It's still spring in May

Wait, save the planet, stay
Save the planet, ѕtаy
