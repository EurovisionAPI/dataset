Junior Swing

How about a little swaying
Or maybe some extra groove
We're gonna hit the dance floor tonight
Let's feel the rhythm rise
We're gonna have so much fun
Let's get this party pumpin up
We're dancing, shaking, singing, twisting
Round and round
Here we go

Come and join
This Junior Swing
A lifetime experience
Come and join
This Junior Swing
It makes your life hilarious
Don't be scared
Come, grab my hand
I'll show you how to swing along
You won't forget this happy feeling
'Cause it's the Junior Swing

This dance includes everyone
You could be young and old
As long as you let yourself get loose
Be free to lose control
Come on, let's join the fun
We're gonna party all night long
We're dancing, shaking, singing, twisting
Round and round
Here we go
