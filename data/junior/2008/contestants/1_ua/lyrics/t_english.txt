Sailors

The ocean claps playfully at us
Behind the wheel is a smiling captain
Na-na-na, our sails will spread their wings
Aw-woah-ye, full throttle

Sailors on deck, sailors dancing
Repeat these simple movements with us
And there are albatrosses in the sky, albatrosses are flying
Adventure is calling you, don't stand still

All the treasures and wonders on earth
We'll assemble on our ship
The sun shines on us, greets friends
Aw-woah-ye, full throttle

Sailors on deck, sailors dancing
Repeat these simple movements with us
And there are albatrosses in the sky, albatrosses are flying
Adventure is calling you, don't stand still

If the rain is dripping
Open the umbrella
If it gets dark, let's turn on the headlights
Let's put on glasses in the heat

Miracle Team
We're all super, bravo to all of us
Bad weather does not scare us
Overcoming Obstacles

Sailors on deck, sailors dancing
Repeat these simple movements with us
And there are albatrosses in the sky, albatrosses are flying
Adventure is calling you, don't stand still

Sailors on deck, sailors dancing
Repeat these simple movements with us
And there are albatrosses in the sky, albatrosses are flying
Adventure is calling you, don't stаnd ѕtill
