Sleeping Angel

Do you remember how, in the sky
Stars splashed in the darkness
Along the moonlit path in silence
Angels came down to us

Time on leash
Slumbers at the feet of the tired
They are looking for love
Through Times and Countries

In the pouring rain
Rain is someone's tears
I'm letting you go
It's not too late

Thousands of long years
The angels did not know
They are looking for love
Where it is lost

Sleeping angel
And every year the eternity angel will return
And the best day will pass
An angel is sleeping, be there
When my angel falls asleep

He's always with you
He looks with reproach from above
Angels Behind Your Back
They walk inaudibly

With a snowy flap of his wing
Sorrows will be swept away
You know everything will come back
Everything we lost

Sleeping angel
And every year the eternity angel will return
And the best day will pass
An angel is sleeping, be there
When my angel falls аѕleep
