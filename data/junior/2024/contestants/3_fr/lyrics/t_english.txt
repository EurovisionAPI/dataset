Like this, like that

Tonight
We're good on Earth
You and I
We could draw
A huge rainbow
In our arms, the whole universe
Like a daydream
Where nothing would ever be the same
We could mix our hopes under a great sun
Our greatness and our smiles
Our colours and our desires
All we are, all we are
All we love
United in a poem

Like this, like that
Like this, like that
Like this, like that
Like this, like that
Like this, like that
One, two, three, four

Oh la la la
We're like this, like that
Different, you and me
Oh la la la
We're like this, like that
We'll always love each other

It's much better this way
We're rich in our differences
No matter where we go
And what we think
No one will stop us anymore
We're stronger, you see
Mixed, you and me

Oh la la la
We're like this, like that
Different, you and me
Oh la la la
We're like this, like that
We'll always love each other

Tonight
It's you and me
On the planet
Nothing can stop us
One, two, three, four
Hand in hand
We're getting together
Everything is bigger
We go further
Simply
Here we go

Like this, like that
Oh la la la
Like this, like that
We will love each other
Like this, like that
Just you and I
We will love each other
Oh la la la
Like thiѕ, like thаt
