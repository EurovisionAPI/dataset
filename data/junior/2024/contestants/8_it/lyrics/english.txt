Pyjama Party

The stars light up in my house
Come with whoever you want to my pyjama party
Send this invitation to all your friends
Write the theme in big letters: "Love is"

The Italian night, beautiful to die for
Hands up to the moon until the sun rises
It's the best party ever, we can live it together
You can jump or you can dance, love will last forever

We dance in the room because tonight it's a party
Jump on the bed and sing: "Love is the answer"
Tonight, there are many of us at my pyjama party
So come and sing it loud: "Love is the answer"

If today you're feeling a bit down or if you're feeling lonely
We want you here at my pyjama party
Here, the only war is fought with pillows
Sing and you'll feel better, there's nothing better than

The Italian night, beautiful to die for
Hands up to the moon until the sun rises
It's the best party ever, we can live it together
You can jump or you can dance, love will last forever

We dance in the room because tonight it's a party
Jump on the bed and sing: "Love is the answer"
Tonight, there are many of us at my pyjama party
So come and sing it loud: "Love is the answer"

I want to hear it in chorus like when there's the anthem at the stadium
All hugging, but tonight we are the champions
And we sing at the top of our lungs, many voices as one
Shout it as loud as you cаn
Love is forever - forever

Love iѕ forever
