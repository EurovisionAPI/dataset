Save the Best for Us

I've been to the Amazon and to Bermuda
I discovered the rainforest with my finger on the mobile phone screen
The peaks of the mountains, the colours of the seas
But one day I want to see the world with my own eyes

I have all its wonders in my head
But I wonder will the wonders still be there tomorrow?

So save the best for us
Save the oceans and the trees, the mountains and the air we breathe
Save the best for us
This world can take your breath away, it's beautiful in every way

Save the best, the best for us
Save the best, the best for us
Sometimes words are not enough

Life still has so much to give us
I want to see polar bears
And one day stand at the North Pole
But the glaciers they're melting
The forests they burn
And time is running out
To see the world through my eyes

I have all its wonders in my head
And if we fight for them, the wonders will still be there tomorrow

So save the best for us
Save the oceans and the trees, the mountains and the air we breathe
Save the best for us
This world can take your breath away, it's beautiful in every way

Save the best, the best for us
Save the best, the best for us
Sometimes words are not enough

Save the best, the best for us
Save the best, the best for us
Sometimes words are not enough

(Save the best, the best for us)
(Save the best, the best for us)
Sometimes words are not enough

So save the world for us
Because without you it won't work
It's not too late to underѕtаnd
