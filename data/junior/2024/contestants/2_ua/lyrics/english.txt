Hear me now, hear me now
You'll never be alone
Hear me now

Beat, beat, beat…
The sky is raining, the sky is raining
Beat, beat, beat…
Sometimes we fall to pieces
Sometimes we fall apart

Hear me now, hear me now
There is no better place than home

Home is where you spread your wings
Where the faith in your dreams grows
Home is where you can be yourself
Whoever you want to be, your loved ones will stay by your side
Home is where, I believe, the light will break through
Your voice will be heard, the music of your heart
Home is where you are never alone
Home is where freedom always breathes
Na-na-na…
Freedom breathes, where freedom breatheѕ

Na-na-na…
Hear me, hear me now
Na-na-na…
Heаr me now
