To My Mom

A street as beautiful as spring
A path as lovely as spring
The sunny love seems never-ending
The sky smiles peacefully at me

My heart races and beats without rhythm
I hurry, I hurry to stretch time
With your smile

It snows beautifully with a smile
In my heart, it snows elegantly
The sun quietly smiles
And gently caresses the snow

Shadows appear on the empty street
The sun plays like a carefree child
Your smile warmed the street
Like a friend, it understands me

Like a friend, it will embrace my heart
It will smile at me and spread its wings
Together we'll draw the paths

It snows pinkly
In my heart, it snows with love
The sun quietly smiles
And tenderly caresses the snow

For the paths adorned with song
I will sing a ѕong
I will come to you
I will take your hand
Mom

You аre only mine Mom
