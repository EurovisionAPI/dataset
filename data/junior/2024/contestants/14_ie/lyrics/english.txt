Together

My heart is beating in the night
Beating so strong
How I want my voice to soar
But I don't know if I can

I'm struggling but I'll be brave for you
I'll climb any mountain
Oh you'll see

With wonder in my heart
With you by my side
Singing out loud
For you and I it's true

Na na na…

Just like you
Like a star in the sky
Ooh together, together
Me and you, glowing like stars in the sky
Ooh together, together

I have a lot to learn
A steep path to climb
But I'm even stronger now
Because I'm imagining you
And it brings me peace
'Cause I can climb any mountain, you'll see

Just like you
Like a star in the sky
Ooh together, together
Me and you, glowing like stars in the sky
Ooh together, together

Soaring above the light of a star
Ready to fly right now
Wings below my heart
Any challenge I can face

Na na na…

Just like you
Like a star in the sky
Ooh together, together
Me and you, glowing like stars in the ѕky
Ooh together, together-la-la

Na na na…

Ooh together, together-la-la
Ooh together, together-la-la
Ooh together, together-la-la
Ooh together, together-la-lа
