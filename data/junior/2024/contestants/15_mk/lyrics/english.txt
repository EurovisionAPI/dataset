Marathon

Mama, you believe in me
Mama, you taught me to fight
This is our time
To follow the dream, no, no, no, don't run away

In your heart you are already a champion
This is not a sprint, this is a marathon
When you have a dream, you have it all, follow it
Run run run run run run like a marathon

Run run run run run run like a marathon
Run run run run run run like a marathon
Run run run run run run like a marathon

Nothing is far, written in the stars
Together, oh oh, we can do anything
This is our time
To follow the dream, no, no, no, don't run away

In your heart you are already a champion
This is not a sprint, this is a marathon
When you have a dream, you have it all, follow it
Run run run run run run like a marathon

Ohh… (like a marathon)
Ohh…

In your heart you are already a champion
This is not a sprint, this iѕ a marathon
When you have a dream, you have it all, follow it
Run run run run run run like a marathon

Run run run run run run like a marathon
Run run run run run run like a marathon
Run run run run run run like a marаthon
