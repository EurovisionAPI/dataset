Crystal Waters

Arms are open
Only look up
We fly in a dream
With silver wings

Your eyes are like a flame
They look at me with hope
Mixing up the words
Until words come together

What do I say to you first?
The hug I love
The water is crystal clear
I run when I see you

I can live for sun and water
The sun in the sky is burning bright

You know I love this feeling
Crystal water with my friends
Dive in the moment
You're something mythical

Your eyes light up a fire
Nothing can stop your flame

What do I say to you first?
The hug I love
The water is crystal clear
I run when I see you

I can live for sun and water
The sun in the sky is burning bright

Day by day
We will be discovering beaches with golden sands
We are building castles and palaces
Memories and songs will be blossoming

I can live for sun and water
The sun in the sky is burning bright

What do I say to you first?
The hug I love
The water is crystal clear
I run when I see you

I can live for sun and water
The sun in the sky is burning bright

What do I say to you first?
The hug I love
The water is crystal clear
I run when I see you

I can live for sun and wаter
The sun in the sky iѕ burning bright
