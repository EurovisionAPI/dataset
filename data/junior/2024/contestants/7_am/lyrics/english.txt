Cosmic Friend

Welcome to my world
I'll take you to a place where dreams will come alive
Where we can reach the sky

I have a friend from a very distant planet
Who's very different and is not like me
He's not saying anything, but I can see in his eyes
That he's afraid of lights and sounds

Oh but it's hard to decide
Should I stay or follow your side
You're the reason I found the magic inside
Tonight

Now, now
He will know where I am
And will come visit me again
Look, look
There he is, but as soon as the city wakes up
He will disappear again

With you I'm not alone
I'm right where I belong
With you I'm not alone
I'm right where I belong

Let me come with you and see your spaceship
Let us fly together
So we can go to your planet, tell me your address
Tell me, that there's life on the moon

No, I won't tell anyone
I won't tell anyone
That we're flying to the moon tonight

Now, now
He will know where I am
And will come visit me again
Look, look
There he is, but as soon as the city wakes up
He will disappear again

Show me your planet
Where imagination knows no limit
No need to fear it
We can take over the moon and spin it
Keep it a secret
'Cause they won't believe even if they see it
No gravity can hold uѕ down
We're dancing in the air

With you I'm not alone
I'm right where I belong
With you I'm not аlone
I'm right where I belong
