All Together

One for all, all for one
United by strength to change the world
To break the wall separating us
All together - you and me, and each of us

Please don't tell me I still got time
There are many ways ahead of me, I know
Together we're strong, believe me
Who if not we?

All together - you and me
United by strength to change the world
To break the wall separating us
All together - you and me, and each of us

Please don't tell me to wait
I understand, feel and I know that
On my way to dreams
Believe me, nothing will stand

One for all, all for one
All together we can change the world again
Let's be one, the time has come
All together we can break the wall again

I'm not afraid to bloom like a flower, to live
On my way to dreams
Believe me, nothing will ѕtand

One for all, all for one
All together we
We can chаnge the world
