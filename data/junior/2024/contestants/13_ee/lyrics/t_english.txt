Streets

Whiter than white is everything in the beginning
On these streets
Those illusions that you are young and don't know
We don't believe; don't take for truth
You don't have to change anymore
You don't have to lose yourself
You don't have to pretend here anymore

There will be no silencing
Of our voice on these streets
Here we were young and here together
We left our hearts
The voices won't be silent
On these grey streets
Every house is painting a story for us here
On those shabby walls

There are young poets and musicians here
Together with their bold ideas
No one can stop them
No one can stop them
You don't have to change anymore
You don't have to lose yourself
You don't have to pretend anymore here

There will be no silencing
Of our voice on these streets
Here we were young and here together
We left our hearts
The voices won't be silent
On these grey streets
Every house is painting a story for us here
On those shabby walls

Freely, as far as you want
Freely you can fly now

There will be no silencing
Of our voice on these streets
Here we were young and here together
We left our hearts
The voices won't be silent
On these grey streets
Every house is painting a story for us here
On those shabby wаllѕ
