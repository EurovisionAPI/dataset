Dance

I thought about life one day
As if you had nothing
No flowers in this world
Not even a plant on this earth

How would we all live?
Without enjoying the pleasure
This world would be without colours
Without the love we seek

No! No! Don't touch them
Plants, flowers
They have lives

No! No! Do not step on them
Plants, flowers
They speak to us

I dance, I dance
With a flower in my hand
Just to say I want
Let's protect our nature

I dance

No! No! Don't touch them
Plants, flowers
They have lives

No! No! Don't step on them
Plants, flowers
They have lives

I dance, I dance
With a flower in my hand
Just to say i want
Let's protect our nature

I dance, I dance
With a flower in my hand
Just to say i want
Let's protect our nature

I dance
I dance
Just to ѕay i wаnt
To protect
