Music

All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh ohh…
Sing it worldwide

No one could hear me, I was singing secretly to myself
But now I step forward without fear, I feel
Better, confident, I'm feeling good about myself
I felt lost but the music got me
Screaming from the rooftop, come on, shout it out
Everybody sing it out loud

All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh ohh…
Sing it worldwide
In harmony, together we unite
Oh oh ohh…
Together until the end
We'll go beyond the stars, our light shining forever
Screaming from the rooftop, shout it out
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh ohh…
Till the end of time

But what if it gets silent? A world without sound
No one listens to each other's stories anymore
So don't turn down the lights
Come sing along?
Let's sing in harmony
And join us in the symphony
Everyone understands the language of music

All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh ohh…
Sing it worldwide
In harmony, together we unite
Oh oh ohh…
Together until the end
We'll go beyond the stars, our light shining forever
Screаming from the rooftop, shout it out
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh ohh…
Till the end of time

The music got me like
Ohh, sing
Like ohh.., sing
Like ohh, sing
Like ohh, sing

All we need is music in our liveѕ
Oh oh ohh…
Sing it worldwide
