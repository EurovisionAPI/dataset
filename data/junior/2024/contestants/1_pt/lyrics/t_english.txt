Hope

I need hope
For a better day
A better life
For all my dreams

Every day another mountain
That my soul takes on
Without thinking about tomorrow
Every day is an achievement
That at the end of the day
Fills my heart

I believe in my dream
And I will fight
To make it happen one day

My heart
Believes
It's my dream
Let it be

Several doors closed when I tried to enter
Almost no one trusted me but I did
They say that life is sometimes not how you want it
I learned that and it wasn't even from others

It was with myself, with my dreams and ambitions
And one of those dreams is to reach hearts
Because music is not just songs
It's my story that I sing with lots of love

There will always be walls
But if you have
Hope
You will overcome them
Because after all

I need hope
For a better day
A better life
For all my dreams

My heart
Believes
It's my dream
Let it be

If we want to
Make a dream come true
We have to fight for it
Even if there are sleepless nights
Trust yourself
If you have a dream, give it time and you will see

Fight for it
Dream for it
You hаve to believe
Juѕt fight, fight for it

I need hope
