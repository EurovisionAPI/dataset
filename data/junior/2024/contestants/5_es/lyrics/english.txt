At school everyone says I'm crazy
But I don't care because they're wrong
I'm going to work hard on it, I'm going to put faith in it
The biggest dreams are baby seeds at first

I'm like fish in the water when I go on stage
It has to do with planets, I am an Aquarius
Already from the cradle I held the rattle
As if it were a microphone to sing to the whole world

When I grow up I want to be a "cantista"
Singer and artist, the protagonist
What! What! What!

Like Taylor
Like Karol
I want to be the "motomami" of my hood
Like Olivia
Like She Wolf (Shaki!)
But universal like Lola

Like Lo-lo-lo Lola
La-la la Lo-lo-lo Lola
Like Lo-lo-lo-lo (Who?)
Lola Flores, the greatest and the queen of hearts

Like Lola!
Like Lola!

Who said fear?
It's just a game
(No pretending)
I love the old
I love the new
True art
Burns like fire and is deeper than the sea
And tickles your belly in a single beat

When I grow up I want to be a "cantista"
When I grow up I want to be a "cantista"
When I grow up I will be a "cantista"
What! What! What!

But universal like Lola
But universal like Lola!

Like Lo-lo-lo Lola
La-la la Lo-lo-lo Lola

Lola Flores, the greatest and the queen of hearts

Like Lo-lo-lo Lola
La-la la Lo-lo-lo Lola
Like Olivia
Like She Wolf (Shaki!)
But universal like Lola

(Like Lola)
I want to sing in every city
(Like Lola)
And I want to see the whole Europe dance!
(Like Lola)
We are young and we want to dream
Music winѕ, I wanna dance!

Like Lo-lo-lo Lola
La-la la Lo-lo-lo Lola

Like, like
Like Lola, Lola
