Little star

Like a little star, in immensity, lost in darkness
Uncertain about my imminency, my feelings, my immediate destination

Till a dim light emitted from the sun shrouded me, near me
Because I'm a little star, with dazzling light, you found me

With one smile I perceived the significance of love
This new life with you by my side, I discovered myself

I fly high where I can dream
Surrounded with this light I sing these lyrics for you
If scared, because of meaninglessness
A look inspired me with everlasting courage

Wherever I am, you are by my side
Embracing you throughout this wondrous journey
Not scared because the dazzling light
In your eyes radiates like the sun

Like a little star that is growing, somewhat somehow lost
The light leads me, guides me, you found me

With one smile I perceived the significance of love
This new life with you by my side, I discovered myself

I fly high where I can dream
Surrounded with this light I sing these lyrics for you
If scared, because of meaninglessness
A look inspired me with everlasting courage

Wherever I am, you are by my side
Embracing you throughout this wondrous journey
Not scared because the dazzling light
In your eyes radiаtes like the sun

Your eyes glisten like the sun
Your eyes glisten like the ѕun
