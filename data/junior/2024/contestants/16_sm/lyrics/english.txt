Like us

It's three o'clock, I never sleep
I still have your voice notes on my screen
Then I press play, my head spins
I let myself get carried away by the music and…

I get lost in the pages of a book I've never read
And I'm sure you're doing the same because
We are bound by something immense that will never fade

Because no one in the world is like us
Walking above the stars
Barefoot 'cause it's more fun, always like this, uh-oh uh-ohh
We fly high without wings, how beautiful the world looks from here
Our stories have special effects
Just like in Stray Kids' videos

Stay here, don't say "no"
Tell me the secrets I don't know yet
TV shows, TikTok lives, I still don't know if he'll call me or not

Because no one in the world is like us
Walking above the stars
Barefoot 'cause it's more fun, always like this, uh-oh uh-ohh
We fly high without wings, how beautiful the world looks from here
Our stories have special effects
Just like in Stray Kids' videos

Not even time touches us, you know
What we are will never change
Not even time touches us, you know
What we are will never change

Because no one in the world is like us
Walking above the stars
Barefoot 'cause it's more fun, always like this, uh-oh uh-ohh
We fly high without wings, how beautiful the world looks from here
Our stories have special effects
Just like in Strаy Kids' videoѕ
