Europe

You can learn to sing
Like a Madonna
And learn to dance
Like Rihanna
Buy and put on a crown
Or honestly become a screen star

We're all in a maze
Paths and thoughts
And everybody wanting to go out
Storming Your Brain
We are all identical
And all of them are unique
Everyone is personal
But we have the same roots
That's why everybody, everybody, everybody
Sing:
Oh-oh-oh
Dancing
Pa-pa-pa
All of Europe
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Oh-oh-oh
Pa-pa-pa
Europe

You can learn to drive the ball
Like Ronaldo
And they will get an Oscar like the stars of the screen
Probably, it is better to be completely unique
And to become the first and the most in the world

We choose our highway
To move through the life
We all strive to stay and
To move in the fast lane
We're all shining brightly
With love and passion
All doing great things
Coz we're the nation
So let us sing-sing-sing
Together oh-oh-oh
And clap it up-up-up
On the dance-floor
Sing, sing, sing
Oh-oh-oh
Up-up-up
Europe

That's why everybody, everybody, everybody
Sing:
Oh-oh-oh
Dancing
Pa-pa-pa
All of Europe
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Oh-oh-oh
Pa-pa-pa
Europe
So let us sing-ѕing-ing
Together oh-oh-oh
And clаp it up-up-up
Europe
