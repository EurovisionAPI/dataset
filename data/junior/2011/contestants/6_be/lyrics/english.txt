A kiss more

No, I don't dare
Or at least, but very quickly
Yes, where no one sees us
See now, I'm already getting goosebumps

And then I close my eyes
It itches and, oh…

Show me the stars
Yes, preferably about ten
And brings spring to my heart
Abduct me to the moon
My heart starts beating faster
Because this feeling is really special

Soft, tender, over and over again
Mmm a kiss more
Yes yes

I'm whispering, I'm listening
I love you, oui je t'aime
Yes, in all languages of the world
Trust me, I'm serious

And then I close my eyes
It itches and, oh…

Show me the stars
Yes, preferably about ten
And brings spring to my heart
Abduct me to the moon
My heart starts beating faster
Get ahead of yourself but don't go too fast

Soft, tender and over and over again
Mmm a kiss more
Yes yes, yes yes, yes yes

It makes my little toe tingle
I never want to lose this feeling
I'll remember this forever
I'll keep that first kiss forever
Oh…

Show me the stars
Yes, preferably about ten
And brings spring to my heart
Abduct me to the moon
My heart starts beating faster
Because this feeling is really special

Yes, show me the stars
Yes, preferably about ten
You bring spring into my heart
Abduct me to the moon
My heart starts beating faster
Get ahead of yourself but don't go too faѕt

Zacht, tender, come again
Mmm а more
