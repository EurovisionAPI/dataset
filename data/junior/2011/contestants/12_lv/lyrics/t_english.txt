Moondog

When the road home leads I know someone is waiting for me
My good friend for you, I always smile
The night will not scare you, the wind will dispel your fears
You are my good friend

Moon, your voice opens
The moon, the rays catch dreams
The distant, golden moon
He's talking to you, he's fooling you
Your dog's heart is beating in your chest

When it rains in the night rains you sleep, at my feet
This is what we can call our home
You… be my only good friend

Moon, your voice opens
The moon, the rays catch dreams
The distant, golden moon
You're talked to like that, you're fooled by it
Your dog's heart is beating in your chest

Moon, your voice opens
The moon, the rays catch dreams
The distant, golden moon
You're talked to like that, you're fooled by it
Moon, moon, moon аnd sunѕ
