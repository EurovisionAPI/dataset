Clouds

There is nothing like the world
Where I live, where I live
There's nothing like that road
Which day I go, I go every day

Who will tell me why I look to heaven
Who will tell me why I feel weird

When clouds over the roofs of the city
Hangs when there is no trouble left
I want to get them all together
I want to hug them all
And in your mind to stay

There is nothing more perfect than morning
When you open the door, when you raise your eyes
I see a fog fluttering in the sky
He takes over thoughts, he takes over thoughts

Who will tell me why I look to heaven
Who will tell me why I feel weird

When clouds over the roofs of the city
Hangs when there is no trouble left
I want to get them all together
I want to hug them all
And in your mind to stay

When clouds over the roofs of the city
Hangs when there is no trouble left
I want to get them all together
I want to hug them all
And in your mind to stay

And in your mind to ѕtаy
