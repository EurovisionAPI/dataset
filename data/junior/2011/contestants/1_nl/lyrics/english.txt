Teenager

(Um, um, um, we say no-oh-way)
(Um, um, um, we say no-oh-way)

I like to watch TV late at night
And the next day sleep well until two
Work will come later, my life is fun
Yes, the world at my feet
There's nothing you can't do
(Three, two, one)

I'm a teenager, I do what I want
You can't get me quiet anymore, no wa-ay
I'm a teenager, every day I have fun
Don't think about school for a while, no I have something else on my head

We say um, um, um, we say no-oh-way
Um, um, um, we say no-oh-way

Calling friends, shopping in the city
I procrastinate on my homework, I've had it for a while
See that cute boy, fall a little in love
Tell the police, he's a heartthrob
(Three, two, one)

I'm a teenager, I do what I want
You can't get me quiet anymore, no wa-ay
I'm a teenager, every day I have fun
Don't think about school for a while, no I have something else on my head

We say um, um, um, we say no-oh-way
Um, um, um, we say no-oh-way
Um, um, um, we say no-oh-way
Um, um, um, we say no-oh-way

It's so much fun to be a teenager
I know what I want
It's my time to shine

Um, um, um, we say no-oh-oh-way
Um, um, um, we say no-no-oh-oh…
Um, um, um, we say no-no-oh-oh…
Um, um, eh-eh-eh
I'm a… ehehe

I'm a teenager, I do what I want
You can't get me quiet anymore, no wa-ay
I'm a teenager, every day I have fun
Don't think about school for a while, no I have something else on my head
I'm a teenager, I do what I want
You can't get me quiet anymore, no wa-ay
I'm a teenager, every day I have fun
Don't think about school for a moment, no I have something else on my head

We say um, um, um, we say no-oh-way
Um, um, um, we say no-oh-way
Um, um, eh, we say no-oh-way
Um, um, um, we ѕаy no…
