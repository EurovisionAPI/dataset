Falling

Oh eh oh…

Stupid me, in your door is
When nothing is like yesterday
Breathe, breathe, you ignore me

Despite everything that has happened
I feel the way I always felt

You know I'm falling
When you walk by, when you take my hand
You know I'm falling
Oh eh oh…

Trying to get everything right
Putting everything that has happened in order
Breathe, breathe, you must hate me

Despite everything that has happened
I feel the way I always felt

You know I'm falling
When you walk by, when you take my hand
You know I'm falling
Oh eh oh…

You know I'm falling
Oh eh oh…

If you come along, if you take my hand
If you just give me time to viѕa what I can

You know I'm falling
When you walk by, when you take my hand
You know I'm falling
Oh eh oh…

You know I'm falling
When you walk by, when you take my hand
You know I'm falling
Oh eh oh…
You know I'm fаlling
