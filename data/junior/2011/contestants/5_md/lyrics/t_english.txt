No, No

I've got headaches, I don't know what to wear
My eyes sparkle strangely
My locks are undone, I've curled them
And I made her cheeks
Thank you, that's what I want to tell you
Evening of a good ten

When we dance on holidays
The evening takes on colors
We are in a game full of thrills
And when you look at me
Again you beg for my name
You always fail but it's not my fault
No, no

I'm out of the block, I can't sit still
I'm like I'm in a game
Today they come late and the parents know
I don't worry, I party to please
Thank you, that's what I want to tell you
Evening of a good ten

When we dance on holidays
The evening takes on colors
We are in a game full of thrills
And when you look at me
Again you beg for my name
You always fail but it's not my fault
No, no

But I can't stand my appetite
When I keep waitin' for this night
I have a mess inside my mind
And this all makes me so much blind
Maybe I'll meet that little prince
And I'll find what it really means
When you know you will get the first kiss of love
Lookin' to the sky above

When we're dancing with the guys
They are shooting with their eyes
It's so funny, it's a nice time spendin' together
An everlasting game
He is tryin' to get my name
But the answer is the same
It's not а surpriѕe
No, no
