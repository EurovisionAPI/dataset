Angels are fine

With light steps they walk through the sleeping city
Raising the dawn on their wings, heating the world from a deep sleep
Blowing away the cold

Angels of goodness, two white wings
Two white wings over the world
Their grief is pure, like the sea in their eyes
Their tears give us strength

Eternal wanderers, Earth guardians
And their song is flying over the world
The clouds know it
But they will not say to us

Angels of goodness, two white wings
Two white wings over the world

Angels of goodness, two white wings
Two white wings over the world
Their grief is pure, like the sea in their eyes
Their tears give us strength

Angels, аngels
Their grief is pure

Angels of goodnesѕ
