Superhero

I'm different, the atypical boy
I have the thought of a secret agent
Super-intelligent, hyper-powered, megamind
I don't feel pain, it's a secret to me

Invincible, you can't stop me
Even if you try, I hear your thoughts
I know your every move, you ain't got no control
Oh oh…

Today I will look like a friend, but I quickly become an enemy
If you follow me
I am not afraid, I am brave to attack
And I easily defeat you

One, I'm a superhero
Getting stronger, I'm ready for a fight
Let everyone know, remember this face well
Na na na na na hey, the only one

I transform and duplicate myself
I'm appropriating your power, I'm ruling you
I'm erasing your memory in another dimension
I'll leave you for the whole day

Invincible, you can't stop me
Even if you try, I hear your thoughts
I know your every move, you ain't got no control
Oh oh…

You need me when you're in danger
Call me and I'll come to you

One, I'm a superhero
Getting stronger, I'm ready for a fight
Let everyone know, remember this face well
Na na na na na, one only…

Let everyone know, remember thiѕ face well
Na na na na nа hey, the only one
