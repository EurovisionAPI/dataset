Jimmy this tailcoat
Time I Stop
I'm traveling back
And I'm going straight to the ball

All counties
Trimmed
To embrace them
With a song to conquer

Skopje Child, Vienna School
New Cabaret
The violins are playing, choke me
Under a top hat, he thinks a lot
Give me a kiss again
I love you
Jimmy this tailcoat

I'm Dorian
Story Name
That's where I came
From Song and Carriage

All countieѕ
Smelled
I'm going to hug them
I'm going to walk them аround
