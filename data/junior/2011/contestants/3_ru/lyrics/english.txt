Romeo and Juliet

I cannot sleep from night until morning
It is not insomnia, I am just in love
I always thought it couldn't be like this
But I cannot forget about you

I know I cannot hide my feelings
They are set free

Like Romeo and Juliet
I am ready to follow you until the world's end
Maybe I am dreaming
Where can I find the answer
Is it true or not
Like Romeo and Juliet
We are free like the wind
We cannot hide or escape
I can feel it in my blood
The first love

My mum won't understand what is happening
It's better she doesn't know that my heart is
Beating like crazy
Jumping out of my chest
But I keep all the doubts behind

The love has given us wings
And opened us heaven

Like Romeo and Juliet
I am ready to follow you until the world's end
Maybe I am dreaming
Where can I find the answer
Is it true or not
Like Romeo and Juliet
We are free like the wind
We cannot hide or escape
I cаn feel it in my blood
The firѕt love
