Do It My Way

This song will take over you
And will make you move
The ground will shake from our power
Baby, now you are in my area

This song didn't turn out too kind
But look at us and where we're now
Oh ahh (look at us now), oh ahh

I'm too cool to be a fool
So don't you mess with me

I'mma do it my way
And I'm breaking the rules
No matter what they say
Ain't nothing I can't do

I don't like cha-cha-cha, that's not my style
I have to be myself and I won't be shy
Boom, now I run this room and your eyes are on me
Wroom, move it with the groove, movin' with your body
I'll take me to the stop, never gonna stop
I'm number one I'm never gonna lose

So don't stay at home, don't stay at home, don't stay at home – come outside
Oh ahh (come outside), oh ahh

Let's play another game
Or stop bothering me

I'mma do it my way
And I'm breaking the rules
No matter what they say
Ain't nothing I can't do

I'mma do it my way
And I'm breaking the rules
No matter what they ѕay
Ain't nothing I can't do

I'mmа do it… hey!
