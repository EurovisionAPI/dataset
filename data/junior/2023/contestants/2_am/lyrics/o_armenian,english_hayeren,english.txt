Do It My Way

Es yergy qez taneluya
U teghits' qez ver haneluya
Mer uzhits' hima hoghy kdogha
Baby, now you are in my area

Bari - bari ch'stats'vets' es yergy mi tesak
Bayts' ari u ari u ari u tes ur hasanq
O aaaa (tes yes ur hasanq), o aaaa

I'm too cool to be a fool
So don't you mess with me

I'mma do it my way
And I'm breaking the rules
No matter what they say
Ain't nothing I can't do

Ch'em sirum yes ch'a-ch'a-ch'a, ed im vochy ch'i
Yes piti linem vonts' kam u ch'em amach'i
Boom, now I run this room and your eyes are on me
Vroom, move it with the groove, movin' with your body
I'll take me to the stop, never gonna stop
I'm number one I'm never gonna lose

De tany mi mna, tany mi mna, tany mi mna, de ari durs
O aaaa (de ari durs), o aaaa

Kam ari p'okhenq es khaghy
Kam mi khangari

I'mma do it my way*
And I'm breaking the rules
No matter what they say
Ain't nothing I can't do

I'mma do it my way
And I'm breaking the rules
No matter what they say
Ain't nothing I can't do

I'mma do it… hey
