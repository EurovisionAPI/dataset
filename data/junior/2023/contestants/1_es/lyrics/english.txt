I love you
My love, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
So many ways to say I love you
And shout them all over the world

I love you
My love, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
So many ways to say I love you
And shout them all over the world

I would like every day to live like this
To bring back from every little corner some souvenir
I would like to discover each country
To know its secrets

I would like to dive in every sea
I would like to speak the language of your home
And that you tell me the legends that in the end
End up in stories

I will learn to dream in every language
I will learn to say

I love you
My love, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
So many ways to say I love you
And shout them all over the world

I love you
My love, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
So many ways to say I love you
And shout them all over the world

I wish my movie trip
To defy the laws of physics
Today at the Eiffel Tower
Tomorrow at Big Ben
And every night in a castle I'll dine on cake

And climb the rooftops
Throw confetti everywhere
And if you want to come
I'll wait for you here
You're all invited

I love you
My love, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
So many ways to say I love you
And shout them all over the world

I love you
My love, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
So many ways to say I love you
And shout them all over the world

So many ways to say I love you
And shout them all over the world

I'll learn to dream in every language
I will learn to say

I love you
My love, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
So many ways to say I love you
And shout them all over the world

I love you
My love, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
So many ways to say I love you
And shout them all over the world

So many ways to say I love you
And ѕhout them аll over the world

I love you
