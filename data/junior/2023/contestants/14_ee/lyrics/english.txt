Staying together

When you are feeling alone
Not able to get over your worries
And it seems that your friends
Don't care, don't love you
Believe, hope and know
That everything be alright
Know that a good friend
Is coming to you
Oh ohh…

Staying together
So we have hope
That a friend is there
Be there
Staying together
So we have hope
That a friend is there
Be there

When you need support
A friend will guide you
And together
You'll find new strength inside
Oh ohh…

Staying together
So we have hope
That a friend is there
Be there
Staying together
So we have hope
That a friend is there
Be there
Ah ahh…

Staying together
So we have hope
That a friend is there
Be there

Staying together
Days will be better
A friend is right there with you
Always there with you

Staying together
Days will be better
I will ѕtаnd by you
