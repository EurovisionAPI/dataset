Back To Life

I get so fascinated
In this old ghost town
I keep on seeing faces
When no one is around
And I know
That I'm playing with fire, out here alone on my own
I get so distracted
I walk right into hell
My hands just start reacting
Am I under your spell
So let's go
I'm not scared of the dark, wanna go where the moon doesn't glow

No, I can't help it
I just cannot help myself
You get it
If all our fears get buried tonight
That's fine
'Cause maybe we can dance you back to life

'Cause maybe we can dance you back to life
Bring you back to, bring you back to, bring you back to, back to life

The thunder and the lightning
Like you have never seen
I know it should be frightening
But I just feel so free
In this town
Yeah, I just wanna stay

No, I can't help it
I just cannot help myself
You get it
If all our fears get buried tonight
That's fine
'Cause maybe we can dance you back to life

'Cause maybe we can dance you back to life
Bring you back to, bring you back to, bring you back to, back to life

You've been living in the shadows
And the dark is all you need
But I wanna see you in the light
(See you in the light)
Can you feel your heart beating
And the way you started breathing
'Cause we're gonna bring you back to li-i-i-ife

No, I can't help it
I just cannot help myself
You get it
If all our fears get buried tonight
That's fine
'Cause maybe we can dance you back to life

'Cauѕe maybe we can dance you back to life
Bring you back to, bring you back to, bring you back to, bаck to life
