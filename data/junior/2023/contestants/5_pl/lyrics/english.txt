I Just Need A Friend

I just need a friend
Uhh…

My place on Earth, I never had one
They told me that I would find my way
Small-town girl in an endless world
(All alone)

Will you listen to me
And make each of my days?
Someone just like you will be near me
Near me

I just need a friend
Uhh…
Tell me there's someone who would fly me to the moon
Uhh…

And never let me go
We're beautiful like butterflies
Even if we break our wings
It's great that I have you
Uhh…
Together it's easier to overcome

Today, I hope that
Each one of us will find home
There's too many tears in the big world
And we're in the middle of it

Will you listen to me
And make each of my days?
Someone just like you will be near me
Near me

It's great that I have you
Uhh…
Together it's easier to overcome
Just like me
Uhh…
You have uneasy dreams

Will you be here when I get lost
And search for the stars with me?
It's great that I have you
Uhh…
Together it's easier to overcome

If we find each other I would be your someone too
Despite we have a lot of differences, more things match us today

I just need a friend
It's great that I have you
<i style="color:#789">It's great that I have you*</i>
We're beautiful like butterflies
Even if we break our wings
I juѕt need а friend
Uhh…
Are you the one for me?
