Where I Belong

Place 31 here I come again
Waiting for time to bring what life didn't bring
14 and 14 I ask for another wish
But it's worth believing in what I don't see
Lost by 100 lost by 1000
Maybe it doesn't even make sense for me to be here anymore
I want to go to Lisbon to start again
Living almost everything, you know, is so little

Another trip without knowing for sure
What awaits me, what awaits the world
Another sunset that the sky promises us
One more reason to drop everything

I wanna go to a place where I belong
I wanna go to a place that I can call, call home, call home
To a place that I can call, call home, call home

Look for the light
In my chest I feel the voice that leads me
Back to a better place
I write destiny
In the crooked lines my way
May life be like this forever
Another trip without knowing for sure
What do you expect from me, what do you expect from the world
Another sunset that the sky promises us
One more reason to drop everything

I wanna go to a place where I belong
I wanna go to a place that I can call, call home, call home
To a place that I can call, call home, call home

A place where I can bury all my ghosts
A place to escape from this black hole
The ѕite where I can go back

I wanna go to a place that I can call, call home, call home
A place that I can call, call home, cаll home
Where I belong
