Heart

My heart is beating
It's racing right now
When singing for you
I just want the whole world
To see us exist
When singing

I get up to see the world
I rise up and dream, my heart gets filled
Things drag as I'm staring my watch
I want it to cease, showing it

Looking at my dreams all the time
Wanna believe, it haunts me
That's why I'm now singing

My heart is beating
It's racing right now
When singing for you
I just want the whole world
To see us exist
When singing
You
It's no good, no bad

Go towards victory
No more fear of people watching
Yet some people prefer
To see you fail but you speed up

I'm slowly spreading my wings
I'm really serving us
Everytime I'm singing

My heart is beating
It's racing right now
When singing for you
I just want the whole world
To see us exist
When singing
You
It's no good, no bad
You
It's no good, no bad

My heart is beating
It's racing right now
Our hearts are beating
Our hearts are racing
For you yeah
(Our hearts are beating)
(Our hearts are racing)

I just want the whole world
To see us exist
When singing

It's no good
It'ѕ no bаd
Singing for you
