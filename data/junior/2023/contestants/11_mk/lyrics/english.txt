Tell me, tell me who

Hm hmm…

Listen, listen to me
And hug me
There is no more time, we are here now
One day we might be gone

Tell me, tell me who
Who's at fault we don't have any heroes
Tell me, tell me who
Happiness is more important than pride
Tell me, tell me who
Every second I grow and learn
Tell me, tell me who
Cuddles me gently to sleep

Oh ah ahh…

Now, hold my hand tight
We gotta win this fight
No more fears, just light
We may be lost but we will find a way
Let's shine the way

Tell me, tell me who
Who's at fault we don't have any heroes
Tell me, tell me who
Happiness is more important than pride
Tell me, tell me who
Every second I grow and learn
Tell me, tell me who
Who cuddles me gently to ѕleep

Oh ah ahh…
(Hold tight you)
Oh ah ahh…
(Hold tight you)
Oh ah ahh…
(And you are the hero)
Oh ah аhh…
