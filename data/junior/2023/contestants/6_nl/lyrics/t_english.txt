Holding On To You

Are you there
Or are you not
Is it maybe
Just what I see
Is there a road we will walk
And how will the stars align

I can't live without it
But what about it
I know better than anyone
What I have in you
Not everything always has a name
But what are we to each other now

I know I don't want to let you go

I try to dance
Here on my own
But I am holding on to you
Will you be there
Do you want this too
Oh I am holding on to you

I'm holding on to you

I'm holding on to you

Whatever I'm doing
Or what I'm thinking about
You're in my head and
It doesn't want to leave
Am I letting me delude myself
Oh or is this how we're like now

I know I don't want to let you go

I try to dance
Here on my own
But I am holding on to you
Will you be there
Do you want this too
Oh I am holding on to you

I'm holding on to you babe

Are you there or not
Is it something I need to see
I don't know what I've got to do
With everything I think
And everything I do
I'm holding on to you

However all stars are aligned
I know I don't want to let you go

I try to dance
Here on my own
But I am holding on to you
Will you be there
Do you want thiѕ too
Oh I am holding on to you

I'm holding on to you bаbe

I'm holding on to you
