My World

No, no
No, no, don't fight

I have a world
It is mine
It's small
Stuffed, crowded

Uh uhh

I dream, I dream there
I am real there
No one judges me
That's where I take risks
I live there, I am here

I want to be real
Living as I want to live

I'm not wrong when I dream
I say every wish and say I am free
I am free, I am free, I am free
How many times I dream
I'm not wrong
I am free instead of free
For every wish, every wish
Uh, I dream

I dream, I dream there
I am real there
No one judges me
That's where I take risks
I live there, I am here

I want to be real
Living as I want to live

I'm not wrong when I dream
I say every wish and say I am free
I am free, I am free, I am free
How many times I dream
I'm not wrong
I'm free instead of free
For every wish, every wiѕh
Uh, I dreаm

No, no
No, no, don't fight
