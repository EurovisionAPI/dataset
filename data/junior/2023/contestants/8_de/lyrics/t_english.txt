Without words

At the end, in the beginning there was just a sound
Just a moment of a touch
Which breaks through every door and every wall
Yet it connected us immediately, immediately
We've been so close yet we've been strangers
We hoped that it would happen
Two standing in the dark, seeing each other for a moment
A moment that will shine forever

Without words, we understood each other immediately
Without words, has been how we found each other
Without words, like soulmates
Without words, without words, without

Let them talk however they want
Our love is what matters
You're my superpower
I am giving you strength
If I'm looking for a light your heart shines so bright
We will go our own way, no matter what
Hand in hand nothing in this world can seperate us

Without words, we understood each other immediately
Without words, has been how we found each other
Without words, like soulmates
Without words, without words, without

Without words
Without words

At the end, in the beginning there was just a sound
Just a moment of a touch

Without words, we understood each other immediately
Without words, has been how we found each other
Without words, like soulmаtes
Without words, without words, without

Without words (without words)
Without words (without words)
Without words (without words, without words)
Without wordѕ
