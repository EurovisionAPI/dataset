A Fair World

There are things that I'd like to understand
But it's not easy
I feel I'm growing everyday
Among a thousand pieces of news

The world is in the hands of rule-makers
But fortunately there is a new moon
Shining on me

Listen to it, hope will accompany us
Without saying a word
Close your eyes and you'll see that when we sing together
In two voices, it becomes stronger

Feel that there is a sky beyond the clouds
With that light blue that is not grey
And even if tears are falling here

I'm searching for a safe shelter
I'm trying to fight instead of crying
For a world that one day will be fair for me

There are things that hurt me but there's music
That can take my hand and lead my soul
From the heart onwards

Then you'll realize
All the emotions that you are feeling could be just like mine
So you keep on believing and trying for
'Cause music speaks louder than words

Feel that there is a sky beyond clouds
And it will shine on you day after day, day after day
And if we run in the grass or in a rainy road
I'll find a shelter between friends like you
And I will try to ѕtruggle not to give up
For a world that one day will be

Fair for you
Fair for you
Fаir for you
