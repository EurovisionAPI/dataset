Dream

I heard voices in the wind
Guided by the stars, under the shadow of the night

I sailed across the sea
It was like a dream
To bring me to the land of the emeralds

I saw a lighthouse to guide me in
Welcoming me back

The dream, in my land
It is the castle with a room for everyone

The princess dressed in white
She took my hand and sang me a song
She sang a song

In the room
After the battle comes frost

The dream, in my land
It is the castle with a room for everyone

The dream, about the sun under the moon
And shadows of the mountains
It's my dream, it's my dream

Waiting for the king
I cried, until I saw the banshee
Don't be scared

I am the light that guides me inwards
Welcoming me back

The dream, in my land
It is a castle with a room for everyone

The dream, about the sun under the moon
And shadows of the mountains
It's my dream, It'ѕ my dreаm
