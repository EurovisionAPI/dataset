Stronger

Patience
You think you cannot cope another day
But all you need is patience
You promised me you wouldn't fade away
Wanting to escape, can't see that you're amazing

Look at your reflection
All you wanna do is change it
Have patience
Don't let it get you down, it's just a phase

Know:
You're so much more than you know
I know we may have a long way to go
But I see the glow in you

Look at us now
Stronger than ever before
We fought all the battles
Jumped all the hurdles
Nothing can stop us
Take a look at us now

Saviour
To mend a broken heart along the way
You thought you'd need a saviour
But you're the only one to make a change
And as we're getting older
We think that we'll be bolder
But here we are still waiting to be saved

Still have a long way to go
But I see the glow in you

Look at us now
Stronger than ever before
We fought all the battles
Jumped all the hurdles
Nothing can stop us

When a storm is awaiting
Just try to be patient
I promise we'll make it somehow

Look at us now
Stronger than ever before
Look at us now
Look at us, look at us
Take a look at us, look at us now
Oooooh take a
Look аt uѕ now
