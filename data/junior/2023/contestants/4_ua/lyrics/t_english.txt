Flower

A mother rocked her daughter Nastyusha
She shook and sang about the healing flower

Flower, flower - mother's winch
Flower, flower - the most, fortunately for the children
Flower, flower - time flies so fast
Flower, flower - good luck for children

Flower, flower
Flower, flower
Flower, flower
Flower, flower - good luck for children

Love will win I know
It's time for your magic
Find yourself in this world
And stop this tragedy

The sun is setting
Stars write poems
Mum, tired eyes
I'll kiss yours
I'll lift you up to the sky, you'll smile
A flower in the heart remains forever

Flower, flower - mother's winch
Flower, flower - the most, fortunately for children
Flower, flower - time flies so fast
Flower, flower - good luck for children

Flower, flower
Flower, flower
Flower, flower
Flower, flower

Find yourself in this world
And stop this tragedy
Stop this tragedy
Stop this tragedy

Flower, flower - mother's winch
Flower, flower - the most fortunately for children
Flower, flower - time flies so fаst
Flower, flower - good luck for children

Flower, flower
Flower, flower - mother'ѕ winch
Flower, flower - good luck for children
Flower, flower
