Unbreakable

God, I have a question
Only one question
How long will this fierce war continue?
If only I knew your plans
Who will heal the wounds
Of all innocent people
Oh God, of your children?
Our time is dripping drop by drop
Not leaving one stone upon another
The enemy is among us but someone will overcome one

Oh-oh my will is unbreakable
Oh-oh I will not surrender to anyone
And I will never betray my sea
I will be strong out of pain and grief
I will be free, I will be beside you

God, I have one question
Why my generation dying young in this war?
But you can save our world, my Lord
Our time is running out as if through our fingers
Shadows disappear on the walls in the rubble
The enemy is among us but we will overcome one

Oh-oh my will is unbreakable
Oh-oh I will not surrender to anyone
And I will never betray my sea
I will be strong out of pain and grief
I will be free, I will be beside you

Oh, I am unbreakable
Look I stay alone
But I'm not scared of
Pain and rain and storm
I know that heaven may
Protect my home
And children never cry and see clear sky
Cause we're born to fly
My land and sea
Will never surrender
Because our will is unbreakable
Oh God, can you heаr me
We will be strong
We will be free
We will win
We will be ѕtrong
We will be free
We will win
