Life is ahead of me

A message woke me up, made me furious again
My friend has shown me his insta post

I don't know why he does this
Showing off in front of his friends
That I am his girlfriend

I have my life ahead of me
Every new day is perfect to me
I'll save love for another time
It's still early for that
Every new day is perfect to me
I'll save love for another time
So, I don't really care

It's still early for that
Still early for that
Early for love, mhm

She is a dangerous drama queen acting as a fashion icon at school
She has no idea she's gonna be mine soon
Easy as two and two, such an easy math to do
He winks when passing by
Comments and thinks he is funny
Let him dream, I won't explain
Chemistry is what I need, rather than math

I don't know why he does it
Showing off in front of his friends
That you're his girlfriend

I have my life ahead of me
Every new day is perfect to me
I save love for another time
I have my life ahead of me
Every new day is perfect to me
I save love for another day
So I don't really care

I don't really care
For you anyway
For you anyway
Nah

There are days for love, don't need it now, no-no
I have my life ahead of me, there's time for that
There are days for love, still no time for that
I have my life ahead of me, there's time for that

I have my life ahead of me
Every new day is perfect to me
I'll save love for another time
It's ѕtill early for that
Still early for that
Eаrly for love
