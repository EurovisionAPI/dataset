Bla bla bla

Bla bla bla… Bla bla bla…

Tell me where the truth is hidden
If I do not find it I'll try and try again

Who does not surrender knows
And will look for it with me
From now on, it's not enough to say stop

Stop the ride, I get off here
You're out of time, follow me
Head is spinning, look that
This is our party

Bla bla bla words words
Bla bla bla just words
Don't you know
Better keep your word
Not doing this, I'm saying it plain and simple
Bla bla bla… words words…
Bla bla bla… just words
Words just words bla bla bla bla bla

But what does age have to do with half-spoken sentences
It makes no sense to think and think about it again
Never give up and feel the beat
Follow this way and we'll be free
Time has come for you and me
To make a brand new day

Bla bla bla words words
Bla bla bla only words
Not doing this, how many qui pro quo
Not doing this, I'm saying it plain and simple
Bla bla bla… words words…
Bla bla bla… just words

It's spring already
There is a new flower this evening
I'll follow a sunflower
And I'll find the words
Let's plant a seed together
That makes us feel good
Oh oh oh oh oh
If I say peace is peace
Then, you'll see how much you'll like it

Bla bla bla words words
Bla bla bla just words
Don't you know
Better keep your word
Not doing this, I'm saying it plain and simple
Bla bla bla… words words…
Bla bla bla… just words

Not doing thiѕ…Bla bla bla bla blа…
