Señorita

I carry an image inside of me
Of a summer full of laughter
Sun-filled white sand

And on that beach you appear
Under the moonlight
As we hear a drumbeat

Dance with me, señorita
The music is never-ending
Come on and give me your smile
From Valencia to İbiza
I think of you day and night
We're gonna sing the melody
My heart needs you
Oh how beautiful
Life is

Dance with me, señorita, yeah yeah yeah
Dance, la la la la
All together
You dance with me, I dance with you

Dance with me, señorita, yeah yeah yeah
Dance, la la la la
You dance with me, I dance with you
Dance with me, señorita

I'm going to ask the stars
For a dream where I want to live
My whole life and never wake up

Words can't express
What this rhythm is making me feel
A whole new world to discover

Dance with me, señorita
The music is never-ending
Come on and give me your smile
From valencia to ibiza
I think of you day and night
We're gonna sing the melody
My heart needs you
Oh how beautiful
Life is

Dance with me, señorita, yeah yeah yeah
Dance, la la la la
All together
You dance with me, I dance with you

Dance with me, señorita, yeah yeah yeah
Dance, la la la la
You dance with me, I dance with you
Dance with me, señorita

İt's a summer of love
Because, for a dreamer
There are no limits or borders

Tomorrow will always come
Right now, nothing else matters
With this rhythm, party, let's dance! turn it up

Dance with me, señorita
The music is never-ending
Come on and give me your smile
From Valencia to İbiza
I think of you day and night
We're gonna sing the melody
My heart needs you
Oh how beautiful
Life is

Dance with me, señorita, yeah yeah yeah
Dance, la la la la
All together
You dance with me, I dance with you

Dance with me, señorita, yeah yeah yeah
Dance, la la la la
You dance with me, I dance with you
Dance with me, ѕeñoritа
