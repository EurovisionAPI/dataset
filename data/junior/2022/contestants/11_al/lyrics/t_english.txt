A Bit of Sunshine

When the night comes, and peacefully starts to rest
The moon clinks like a fairy through the glass
I want to confess to her an inner desire of mine
I want to ask her to save the world from this fire

Oh I would love to share a little bit of sunshine with you
And each time you will need me
I would save my breath for you

I pray for you, I would share the world with you
You feel me from beyond, the moon brings you closer
I want to confess her an inner desire of mine
I want to ask her to save the world from this fire

Oh I would love to share a little bit of sunshine with you
And each time you will need me
I would save my breath for you

Aaah…

Oh I would love to share a little bit of sunshine with you
And each time you will need me
I would save my breath for you

I would ѕave my breаth for you
