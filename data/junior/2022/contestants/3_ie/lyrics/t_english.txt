Light

In the silence
The long night is coming
And there is no way back

Metal horses
Like dragons
Breathing fire

Every night
I am the light
I am always with you
Shadows come
After sunset
But I am always with you

Hear the storm
The thunder is getting worse
But the light is still there

Follow the beautiful music
It's inside you, you are ready
To light up the world

Every night
I am the light
I am always with you
Shadows come
After sunset
But I am always with you

Don't be afraid of the big world
Hold onto the magic in your heart
The gold ring that was taken
Aglow, so that it can be recovered

The sun is rising
The shadows retreat
A new day is here

Every night
I am the light
I am always with you
Shadows come
After sunset
But I am alwаyѕ with you
