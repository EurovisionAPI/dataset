Mother Earth

Like stars in the night sky
Sometimes we don't know why
We can't see the lights of the sun
But I know we have to try
See the good things in life
Feel the magic in our hearts

Our future got to be like
Fairytale with flashlights
We just have to make it right

Life's beautiful with nature
Manage to cherish it with love
With an open heart
Mother Earth, you and me
I'm sorry
We do not spare, do not love
Why?

There are so many trials in life
There are many questions in life
Why don't we think them over?

In the hands of virtue
In the first place
We can love it for sure there

Life's beautiful with nature
Manage to cherish it with love
With an open heart
Mother Earth, you and me
I'm sorry
We do not spare, do not love

Your embrace is just a life
Every day, every moment
Let your heart beat together

Life's beautiful with nature
Manage to cherish it with love
With an open heart
Mother Earth, you and me
I'm sorry
We do not ѕpare, do not love
With an open heаrt
