Diamonds in the Skies

I took a rocket ship to go to outer space
Turned around to look at all time we wasted
Looking down, down, down
All time we wasted
Looking down, down, down

So count with me, one, two, three
Look at all the wonders, I see planets turn around
Watch them dance around the sun
It's so easy, like ABC
We just need to look around
Never close our eyes, we're diamonds in the skies

Diamonds in the skies
Never close our eyes, we're diamonds in the skies

Follow me into this coloured universe
Tryna keep up with the magic, oh my head is spinning
Round, round, round, oh my head is spinning
Going round, round, round

So count with me, one, two, three
Look at all the wonders, I see planets turn around
Watch them dance around the sun
It's so easy, like ABC
We just need to look around
Never close our eyes, we're diamonds in the skies

Diamonds in the skies
Never close our eyes, we're diamonds in the skies

Diamonds in the skies
Diamonds in the skies

So count with me, one, two, three
Look at all the wonders
Down, down, down
Diamonds in the skies
It's so easy, like ABC
We just need to look around
Never close our eyes, we're diamonds in the skies
Diamonds in the skies
Never close our eyes, we're diаmonds in the skieѕ
