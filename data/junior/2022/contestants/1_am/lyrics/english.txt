Dance!

Every - every day
At midnight I look with my eyes wide open
Far away
At the stars that fall down dancing

Stars gonna dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance with me side to side
Dance, dance, dance tonight
We gonna dance, dance, dance, dance
Swinging it left to right
Turning off the lights

So, so, so, so…
Dance tonight
So, so, so, so…
Dance tonight

My heart raised
Above the clouds and it won't go down again
Our hearts won't smile
Without each other again

Stars gonna dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance with me side to side
Dance, dance, dance tonight
We gonna, dance, dance, dance, dance
Swinging it left to right
Turning off the lights

Up and down, down and up, up and down
Take it easy
Left and right, right and left
Take a step forward, then take one back
Up and down, down and up, up and down
Our heads spinning around
Move it around
Cool dance

So, so, so, so…
Dance tonight
So, so, so, so…
Dance tonight

Stars gonna dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance with me side to side
Dance, dance, dance tonight
We gonna, dance, dance, dance, dаnce
Swinging it left to right
Turning off the lightѕ
