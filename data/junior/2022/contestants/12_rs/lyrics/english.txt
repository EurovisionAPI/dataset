World Without Borders

He's so pretty that even sunflowers
Turn away from the sun to follow him
Nightingales sing to greet him
More joyful than in spring

Oh, why wouldn't I, Mommy dear
Why wouldn't I fall in love with him
And why do you say it's all an illusion
When I saw with my own eyes

I love mom, I love dad too
But above everything I love my little brother
Yet my heart beats, why would I hide
When I see him, my world turns to magic

Oh, why wouldn't I, Mommy dear
Why wouldn't I fall in love with him
And why do you say I'm just a little girl
When the world of love knows no borders

And why shouldn't I, Mommy dear
Why shouldn't I fall in love with him
And why do you say it's all an illusion
When I saw with my own eyes
Thаt the world of love knows no borderѕ
