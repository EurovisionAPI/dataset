To the Moon

You lost your breath, your heart is maze, I know it
Your every step is a tiny sign of journey

How to find your way, I think it's better
To have dreamed and lost, than to keep saying never
I'll tell you clearly, again
Look boldly higher

Only sky will be the limit
It's your time, so please believe it
I think you're ready now
I think you're ready now
To dream big
Like to the moon and back

Like a priest and back
Don't be afraid, because you can dream
This is your time
This is your time
Only the sky is the limit fight

I don't listen anymore
What they say about me again
It's important what I
Before going to bed, I think about myself

How I'm supposed to find my way, I don't know
It's better to err instead of not trying, after all
I'll tell you clearly, again
Look boldly higher

Like a priest and back
Don't be afraid, because you can dream
This is your time
This is your time
Only the sky is the limit fight

Moon, river
Ah…
Goodnight you live
Peaceful dreams and strength
That you have inside you

Like a priest and back
Don't be afraid, because you can dream
This is your time
This is your time
Only the sky is the limit fight

Only sky will be the limit
It's your time, so pleaѕe believe it
I think you're ready now
I think you're ready now
To dream big
Like to the moon and bаck
