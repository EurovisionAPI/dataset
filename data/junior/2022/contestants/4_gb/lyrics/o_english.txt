Lose My Head

Ya ya ya ya…

You're a wrecking ball in a house of cards
Falling one by one
And I tried real hard like the queen of hearts
In a war I finally won
You are dangerous, give it all I got
But now it's over and done
Cause when you lie, waste my time
I say bye-bye

You like the attention
Never learn your lesson
All the consequences
That's all on you
It's kinda messed up
You try to impress but
I got twenty seconds
Until I lose it, yeah

You get what you want when you want it
Your kind should've come with a warning
No, I can't hide from the truth
I lose my head over you
You take what you need when you need it
Two shocks to my heart just to feel it
No, I can't make no excuse
I lose my head over you

You, you, you, you
I lose my head over you
You, you, you, you

On a rainy day, looking through the glass
That was all it took
And I tried to stay in my wonderland
But I was out of luck
Took it way to far when I said I wouldn't
And I kept doubling up
But honestly, don't you see?
It's my party

You like the attention
Never learn your lesson
All the consequences
That's all on you
It's kinda messed up
You try to impress but
I got twenty seconds
Until I lose it, yeah

You get what you want when you want it
Your kind should've come with a warning
No, I can't hide from the truth
I lose my head over you
You take what you need when you need it
Two shocks to my heart just to feel it
No, I can't make no excuse
I lose my head over you

You, you, you, you
I lose my head over you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, I lose my head over you
You, you, you, you
I lose my head over you

You get what you want when you want it
Your kind should've come with a warning
No, I can't hide from the truth
I lose my head over you
You take what you need when you need it
Two shocks to my heart just to feel it
No, I can't make no excuse
I lose my head over you

You, you, you, you
I lose my head over you
You, you, you, you
I loѕe my heаd over you
