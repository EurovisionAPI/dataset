Oh Mummy!

Oh oh oh…

I'm walking on stage nothing can stop me
Not the no's, not what are you doing stop
I pick up my guitar I fear nothing
I am a star the time of a chorus
For me music is a child's play
No math for the peter pan
A little bit of magic everything's possible
I reach the infinite I feel invincible

Oh mummy, oh daddy
If you knew what's going on in my head
Oh mummy, oh daddy
Try, you'll see, it's quite simple
1,2,3 just clap your hands
I wanna hear you raise the fever
You need the look, the footwork
My dream is coming true like in the mirror of my bedroom

Oh oh oh…

Everyone oh yeah can do it
All it takes is a little bit of imagination
Some joy, some dance
Feet racing and voice swinging
I do no harm, quite the opposite
I make my friends sisters and brothers smile
Don't be surprised, don't be shocked
If you still have doubts let me show you

Oh mummy, oh daddy
If you knew what's going on in my head
Oh mummy, oh daddy
Try, you'll see, it's quite simple
1, 2, 3 just clap your hands
I wanna hear you raise the fever
You need the look, the footwork
My dream is coming true like in the mirror of my bedroom

Oh oh oh…

Oh mummy, oh daddy
Oh mummy, oh daddy
Oh mummy, oh daddy
Oh mummy, oh daddy
Oh mummy, oh daddy
Oh mummy, oh daddy
Oh mummy, oh daddy
Oh mummy and oh daddy

Oh mummy, oh daddy
If you knew what's going on in my head
Oh mummy, oh daddy
Look at me, you'll see it's quite simple
Oh mummy…
I'm acting like a star
I'm acting like a ѕtar
In the mirror of my bedroom
Oh yeаh
