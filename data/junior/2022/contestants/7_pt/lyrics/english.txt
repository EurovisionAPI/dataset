The seventies

Let everybody know
That today I'm off
Today I'll dance
I'm telling you

Let everybody know
I'm not doing well
A bit out of place
And if I go, I'll go wrong
And I'll go wrong

I play an old tune like my father does
If I'm with myself, I really feel in peace
I try to explain, but no one understands
That I should have been born in the 70's
That I should have been born in the 70's

Let me be crazy
Just a little
Have a small piece of the sky
Let me be crazy
I sing hoarsely
But let me just be me

'Cause I don't know how to be anything else
And I don't want anything else
And I don't know how to be anything else
And I don't want anything else

I play an old tune like my father does
If I'm with myself, I really feel in peace
I try to explain, but no one understands
That I should have been born in the 70's
That I should have been born in the 70's

Let me be crazy
Just a little
Have a small piece of the sky
Let me be crazy
I sing hoаrsely
But let me juѕt be me
