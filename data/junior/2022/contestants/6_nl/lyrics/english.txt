The party

Celebrate today
Go for everything there is
Then I will go with you
See us standing
In our most beautiful clothes
Tonight we celebrate

I sing, I feel
The butterflies all day
Just because it can
Because I get to experience this with you

Get ready for the party
La la…
Everything's perfect
Oh oh…
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Tonight will be beautiful
Enjoy the party, party
La la…
Oh oh…
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Tonight will be beautiful
Enjoy the party, party

Time to party
I take a drink and do a dance
With friends all around me
I take you with me
Yes celebrate today in all colours
Dance with everybody

See how I sing, I feel
The butterflies all day
Just because it can
Because I get to experience this with you

Get ready for the party
La la…
Everything's perfect
Oh oh…
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Tonight will be beautiful
Enjoy the party, party
La la…
Oh oh…
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Tonight will be beautiful
Enjoy the party, party

Let's go, let's go
