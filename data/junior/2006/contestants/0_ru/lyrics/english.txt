The Spring Jazz

We're walking around the city, the sun is shining
People are smiling when they're looking at us

Look how similar they are
Yes, we are twins, so what?
We're walking on a crowded road
And singing spring jazz

That the winter has come to an end
An incredible winter
The winter of 2006

And it comes to us again
This young spring
And nature wakes up again

The drivers stop at the crossroads
The smiling policeman lets us move on

Come on, girls
Move along, twins
We're walking on the main road
And singing spring jazz

That the winter has come to an end
Houses have thawed once again
And there is no more bad weather

Get up and sing, it hаs come
This young spring
The spring of 2006
