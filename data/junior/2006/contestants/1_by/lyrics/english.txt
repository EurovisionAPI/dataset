New Day

The trills of the nightingale are quietly echoed by the echo
The earth is still asleep, and in the haze of the river there is a strip
And there are also stars burning in the sky somewhere
All you have to do is open your eyes before sunrise

A new day is born in the rays of mother-of-pearl
Fly away, sweet dream - the time has come for us to part with you
A new day and a wise morning are born
He will open this world wide for love and kindness

On the night tent there are glints of light colors
And the sun-carousel is about to whirl
At the holy dawn, there are no shadows, no masks
At dawn, everyone is like children, everyone is defenseless

A new day is born in the rays of mother-of-pearl
Fly away, sweet dream - the time has come for us to part with you
A new day and a wise morning are born
He will open this world wide for love and kindness

A new day and a wise morning are born
Will open wide
He will open this world wide for love аnd kindnesѕ
