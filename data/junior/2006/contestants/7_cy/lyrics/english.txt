Boys Girls

If only the world would be full of boys
Playing football in the World Cup for years
I wish the world would be filled with girls
Romantically to run to the disco day and night

Everyone, everyone, everyone, we are children
Our world, a city, a global neighborhood
Boys girls together wherever we go
We will have the strength to defeat them all
