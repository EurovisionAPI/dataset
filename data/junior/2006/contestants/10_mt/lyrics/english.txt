Extra Cute

Hello world, get ready
I'm hitting the road
Yeah world, are you ready?
'Cause here I come

I think I'm gonna tell you a thing or two
About a crazy girl who wants to be a star
I think I wanna show you all I can do
And then you gonna judge if I can do it right

I feel the road to stardom might be long
But I'm gonna just believe in my lucky star
They say I'll have to sing and look real good
But I'd like to add I have a high IQ

And yeah, I'm gonna be extra cute
I'm gonna be extra cool
When I'm rolling on the covers of the magazines
Extra cute

When my video is playing on the MTV
Yeah I'm gonna be cool, I'm gonna look cute
I'm gonna be good
And show the world the things I can do
Alright now

One day I will become the queen of rock
And tour around the globe with my one-girl show
And all you boys and girls will move to my beat
And all the bucks I make will go for world peace

And yeah I'm gonna be extra cute
I'm gonna be extra cool
Yeah I'm gonna be cool, I'm gonna look cute
I'm gonna be good
And show the world the things I can do

Come on everybody
Ain't I cool? Tell me I'm good
Extra cute? Woo

And yeah, I'm gonna be extra cute
I'm gonna be extra cool
When I'm rolling on the covers of the magazines
Extra cute

When my video is playing on the MTV
Yeah I'm gonna be cool, I'm gonna look cute
I'm gonna be good
And show the world the thingѕ I can do, yeаh
