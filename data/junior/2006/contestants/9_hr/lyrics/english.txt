Lea

Leah is the only true love
When I'm not with you, my head goes out
Cheeks red, mess in the head
When I see Lea, I forget everything

I don't care, I'll get an ace
When you fall in love, there's no way out

Friends are talking to you
I'm not Leah for you
Your heart will tell you
Who's the Right Boyfriend for You

Leah is the only true love
When I'm not with you, my head goes out
Cheeks red, mess in the head
When I see Lea, I forget everything

I'm texting her, my fingers are shaking
God, do I know the real e-mail address

Friends are talking to you
I'm not Leah for you
Your heart will tell you
Who's the Right Boyfriend for You

Friends are talking to you
I'm not Leah for you
Your heаrt will tell you
Who'ѕ the Right Boyfriend for You
