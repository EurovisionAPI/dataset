My Story

I am a famous character
From fairy tales I came
I'll bring light into your life

It's me, Prince Charming
What a Wizard of Oz
Like me, there's no one else

Only I'm the famous Spider-Man
The pirates just know they're Peter Pan
Like them one day, we may be

Her and what and what if it's not me Peter Pan
Her and what and what if I'm not Spider-Man
Her and what and what if it's not me Peter Pan
Harry Potter, Spider-Man

I'm Harry Potter really
A wizard with grace
Why not Robin Hood himself?

Only I'm the famous Spider-Man
The pirates just know they're Peter Pan
Like them one day, we may be

Her and what and what if it's not me Peter Pan
Her and what and what if I'm not Spider-Man
Her and what and what if it's not me Peter Pan
Harry Potter, Spider-Man

Her and what and what if it's not me Peter Pan
Her and what and what if I'm not Spider-Man
Her and what and what if it's not me Peter Pan
Harry Potter, Spider-Man (Spider-Man)

Her and what and what if it's not me Peter Pan
Her and what and what if I'm not Spider-Man
Her and what and what if it'ѕ not me Peter Pan
Harry Potter, Spider-Man (Spider-Man)
Harry Potter, Spider-Man

La la la…
