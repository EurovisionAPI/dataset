Let me Feel

Accept my world
My way of being
Dream with me, I'll meet you
In this world of mine I'm going to take you
Meaningful or nonsensical
Meaningful or nonsensical

Let me feel the wind
Let's live the moment on the wings of time
Let me fly, get out the window
Looking at the morning like a star
Like a star
Come into my space, steal a piece of me
Live my beat, feel what I do

I want to fly on the wings of the wind
I want to stay in your mind
I want to dive into your sea
I want to be with you at all times

Let me feel the wind
Let's live the moment on the wings of time
Let me fly, get out the window
Looking at the morning like a star
Like a star

I want to fly on the wings of the wind
I want to stay in your mind
I want to dive into your sea
I want to be with you at all times

I want to fly on the wings of the wind
I want to stay in your mind
I want to dive into your sea
I want to be with you at all timeѕ

I wаnt to fly
