I give you my Voice

There is so much to explore, to discover
There's so much to express, that I want to
My mind stayed anchored in you

And I can't find the way anymore
To give you an "I love you" without condition
I can't find words, there's only my voice
I give you my voice

I can tell you that today you show me my freedom
And without your guidance my fantasy ain't coming true
I want to write you a story that talks about a love
That will have no end

Today I keep your inspiration in my drawer
You filled my mailbox with love letters
I'm thinking of you and you alone

Your arms give me calm
Secrets kept between us
Sincere looks fill with illusion
My heart

I can tell you that today you show me my freedom
And without your guidance my fantasy ain't coming true
I want to write you a story that talks about a love
That will have no end

No reason, no why, no explanation
There's you, only you
Today I want to tell you everything that I
I feel inside me

I can tell you that today you show me my freedom
And without your guidance my fantasy ain't coming true
I want to write you a story that talkѕ about a love
That will hаve no end
