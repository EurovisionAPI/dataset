The Nicest anyone can Get

You're pretty the way you are
When you stand with me here
Don't make yourself a lot of extra trouble
But be who you are, and then you will see
You are worth everything that life can give

Every little thing that you do
Every little word I hear
Makes me understand that a friend who is so
Is the nicest thing anyone can get

Everyone has something good, something that others want
Even if it doesn't feel like it every day
It's up to you and also to me
To make sure everything works out

Every little thing that you do
Every little word I hear
Makes me understand that a friend who is so
Is the nicest thing anyone can get

Spread joy and you get double the
Love and you understand

Every little thing that you do
Every little word I hear
Makes me understand that a friend who is so
Is the nicest thing anyone can get
Is the niceѕt thing anyone cаn get
