A Trip through the Dark

A trip through the dark, dididi…
We're not afraid, dididi…
We have a flashlight with us, dididi…
And that makes us happy, dididi…

When we eat Croque-Monsieurs, dididi…
Can we eat well, dididi…
Louise didn't come along, dididi…
She was still in the mood for tea
1, 2, 3, 4

Dididi…

It's New Year's Eve, dididi…
Then we celebrate, dididi…
There are lights burning everywhere, dididi…
Because we shine with our lamp, dididi…
We're going to eat later, mmm
We like that, yes

We sing and we dance, dididi…
Come sing with us
Come on
1, 2, 3, 4

Dididi…

The Walls Are Singing
We dance and jump
Then sing like thiѕ:
Ka-bi-ba-bo
1, 2, 3, 4

Dididi…
