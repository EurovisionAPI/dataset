Good

Everyone thinks they know
To know how everything works
If you don't know anything
Don't say anything

Everybody's just dreaming
Have a lot on their minds
Things are suddenly different
If you believe in the world again

I want more than than the wishes
That all people come up with
Your face counts more than you

I want more than the limits
Which all people want
I don't want to be the way I should be
Yes, being yourself, that's good

Everyone thinks they know
To know how everything works
But they don't know anything

We came into the world
And so see how everything goes
Everybody's just thinking out loud, yes
Just like you don't exist

I want more than than the wishes
That all people come up with
I don't want to be the way I should be
Yes, being yourself, that's good

I want more than than the wishes
That all people come up with
Your face counts more than you

I want more than the limits
Which all people want
I don't want to be the way I should be
Yes, being yourself, that's good
Yes, being yourself, thаt'ѕ good
