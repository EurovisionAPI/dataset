Make It Right!

What do you do when children suffer with pain and hunger?
What do you do when nations fight with all their might?

You just can't sit down, take a look around
We can build a brave new world with no more danger
Just do what is right, be a guiding light
Join our hands and make peace last a little longer

(We can make it right) So right
(We don't need to fight) No fight
We are ready for this, we are not gonna miss
The times are changing

(We will find a way) A way
(For a brand new day) New day
We are young and free like a family
It's time for changing now

There is a way for a brighter new tomorrow
There is no way we can live in grief and sorrow

We can't sit and wait, it can be too late
We can live in harmony and make life better
I am here for you, you can help me too
We can do what we have to do, it's all that matters

(We can make it right) So right
(We don't need to fight) No fight
We are ready for this, we are not gonna miss
The times are changing

(We will find a way) A way
(For a brand new day) New day
We are young and free like a family
It's time for changing now

I can, I will be a force, a new beginning
I know for sure, in the end we will be winning

You just can't sit down, take a look around
We can build a brave new world with no more danger
Just do what is right, be a guiding light
Join our hands and make peace last a little longer

(We can make it right) So right
(We don't need to fight) No fight
We are ready for this, we are not gonna miss
The times are changing

(We will find a way) A way
(For a brand new day) New day
We are young and free like a family
It'ѕ time for chаnging now
