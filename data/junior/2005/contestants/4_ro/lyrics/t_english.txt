Hey!

My mother said, when I asked
That I'm the proudest in the village
Hardworking like no other
He wouldn't give me anytime to anyone

Two blackberries instead of eyelets
And cheeks like two peonies
Braided hair
Mouth like a flowering poppy

That's me and there's nothing I can do
Come on hey and hey and hey
Everybody in the village likes me
Come on hey and hey and hey

Darling, it's from my mouth to sing
Until it gets dark
And I love the hora to play
Fire comes out of the heel

Come on, girl, don't be upset
That it's time to play
Let's both hold hands
How is the game in our country

That's me and there's nothing I can do
Come on hey and hey and hey
Everybody in the village likes me
Come on hey and hey and hey

Darling, it's from my mouth to sing
Until it gets dark
And I love the hora to play
Fire comes out of the heel

When the holiday is in full swing, to be able to dance
To be with girls and boys my age

Two blackberries instead of eyelets
And cheeks like two peonies
Braided hair
Mouth like a flowering poppy

And I love the hora to play
Fire comes out of the heel
Dаrling, it's from my mouth to ѕing
Until it will be
