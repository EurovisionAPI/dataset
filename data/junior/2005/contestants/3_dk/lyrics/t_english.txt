Shake, Shake, Shake

Do you know that feeling when you are in love with a girl
You wade around brain-dead without knowing what to say
Friends ask if the problem is cool
And you tell them everything, yes right
This girl looks really good
Saw her for the first time when my class was going out
On a trip to catch lead fish in a lake
How much fun it was, I swear, I could die
But all was not bad, for the girl was standing there
With long, blond hair and cold toes
Without shit, you have to go and say hello
And all the boys did it, just not me

But why?

She makes me say "huh", break, break
She makes me go up and down, shake, shake, shake
Slow in a back break
Century
She makes me say "damn, wow, wow"
Round and round, up and down we go
Slow in a hand flake
The she makes me electric

But this chick, she's wiggie-wiggie-wild
And if I didn't get her, it would be a mistake
She was going to be impressed, then shouted, "hey"
And played a little with the muscles, yearh, okay
But I couldn't give up after attempt number one
So I thought to myself, I must do something cool
I make shake-shake, but it goes a bit in the goat
What do you think is happening? My pants are falling down

How stupid can you be, man?

She makes me say "huh", break, break
She makes me go up and down, shake, shake, shake
Slow in a back break
Century
She makes me say "damn, wow, wow"
Round and round, up and down we go
Slow in a hand flake
The she makes me electric

Bring the beat back

But we came from this girl next to a lake
She smiles so sweetly that I'm almost dying
She walks a little, I get ready
Suddenly she says something, "shit", you stand bare'
She asks for my name, I don't get a pat
But opens my mouth and sounds a bit like Chip and Chap
With violence, there is a great chance of sounding like a jerk
I look up and say: "Hi, my name is… um… Nicolai"

She makes me say "huh", break, break
She makes me go up and down, shake, shake, shake
Slow in a back break
Century
She makes me say "damn, wow, wow"
Round and round, up and down we go
Slow in a hand flake
The she makes me electric
She makes me say "damn, wow, wow"
Round and round, up and down we go
Slow in a hand flake
The she mаkeѕ me electric
