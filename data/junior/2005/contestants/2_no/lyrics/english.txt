Summer and free from school

When I wake up at dawn on a summer's day
And looking out my window
And the sun is shining and the sky is blue
And I put on my summer dress
Three times five and four plus three
Now I can just blow into it
Because the sun is shining and the sky is blue
And I put on my summer dress
Wow

Summer is what I want
Summer that's what's good
Holidays and school holidays
Then I will be very happy and stay
Summer is what I want
Summer that's what's good
Summer
Summer and school free

And I eat ice cream and enjoy myself raw
Sun and summer, YES it's good
Winter is so cold and so long
No, the best is summer, sun аnd ѕong
Wow
