Birthday Kiss

I've been waiting for this day all year
No one is special to me
And rightly so, I'm just driving
Grandpa where I live teenager

Super E's Birthday Party
And the gift I receive from you
And save the stay to wait
That's why I'm telling him I'm getting it

I'm so excited, I'm in a good mood
I'm going to play the first tango of the century
I can't wait
And I'm going to win
