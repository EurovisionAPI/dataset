Road to the Sun

The whole world is drawn in green and blue
And the sun will stretch out a thread of gold to us
And these roads are like thousands of lines
Which we can connect

The road to the sun through days and nights
You and I are going further and further along it
The road to the sun is always shorter
When you have true friends by your side

There are brushes and paints, which means it's clear
That you can choose any color for yourself
So far, there are blank spots on the planet
We can color them together with you

The road to the sun through days and nights
You and I are going further and further along it
The road to the sun is always shorter
When you have true friends by your side

There is no music of the sun in the world more wonderful
And we still have so much to do
Ordinary notes become a song
Which we can sing with you

The road to the sun through days and nights
You and I are going further and further along it
The road to the sun is always shorter
When you have true friends by your side

The road to the sun through days and nights
You and I are going further and further along it
The road to the sun is always shorter
When you have true friends by your side
When you hаve true friends by your ѕide
