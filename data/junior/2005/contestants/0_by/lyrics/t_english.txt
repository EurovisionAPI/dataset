We are Together

Clouds dance on the palms of the sky
There is a smell of bread and fresh milk in the house
How beautiful it is – sweet land
Our song is flowing, we are one family

Oh, only together we are a great power
Oh, don't spill the water
Oh, so that the joy in the heart does not cool
Oh, you're next to you and me

The world is so beautiful, the colors are rainbow
Everyone has a dream to be always happy
The river is wide in thin streams
Let us be friends – this is my hand

Oh, only together we are a great power
Oh, don't spill the water
Oh, so that the joy in the heart does not cool
Oh, you're next to you and me

We can do a lot when we are together
Let's multiply laughter, smiles, and songs

Oh, only together we are a great power
Oh, don't spill the water
Oh, so that the joy in the heart doeѕ not cool
Oh, you're next to you аnd me
