How Does It Feel?

How does it feel writing songs on a rainy day?
And how does it feel when someone comes and takes them away?
How does it feel when the words just won't flow?

How does it feel? Stars in a winter's sky
And how does it feel? You close your eyes and dream you can fly
How does it feel living life on a high or just trying to get by?

Don't run and hide, nobody's searching
Don't try to walk away or step aside
You've been living life, passing time
So let it shine

Hey, there's a moment waiting
And hey, hear the voices singing a song for the future
There's inspiration when you close your eyes

How does it feel? How does it feel?
How does it feel? You're waiting at the start of the show
How does it feel when the lights go down low
And time moves so slow?

Don't run and hide, nobody's searching
Don't try to walk away or step аside
You've been living your life on the line
So let it ѕhine
