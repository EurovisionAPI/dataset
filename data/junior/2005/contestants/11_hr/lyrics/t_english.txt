Rock Baby

One morning when I woke up
In my thoughts I saw you then
And you don't even see me, you don't even say hello to me
You have headphones on your head and you listen to rock all the time

And that's why I want to be your rock baby
'Cause I think we're a good couple
I'd give everything to you
Take a look at the bar

Your rock baby
'Cause I think we're a good couple
I'd give everything to you
Take a look at the bar

(Rock, rock, rock baby)
(Rock, rock, rock)

I've been trying to reach you for days
I even have your friends' numbers
And you don't even see me, you don't even say hello to me
You have headphones on your head and you listen to rock all the time

And that's why I want to be your rock baby
'Cause I think we're a good couple
I'd give everything to you
Take a look at the bar

Your rock baby
'Cause I think we're a good couple
I'd give everything to you
Take a look at the bar

And that's why I want to be your rock baby
Yes, yes, yes baby ('Cause I think we're a good couple)
I'd give everything to you
Take a look at the bar

Your rock baby
'Cauѕe I think we're a good couple
I'd give everything to you
Take a look at the bar

I'd give everything to you
Take a look at me, bаby
