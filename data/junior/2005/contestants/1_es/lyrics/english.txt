I bring you Flowers

It is worth it to go around the full moon a thousand times
Steal melodies to make a song
In my own way I sing to you, my flamenco
That it's not daring, it's that my heart sings

And today I bring you April flowers
Cortaditas come full of colors
And today I give you a day full of sunshine
A drawing, a poem, a rumba
My Collection Bowls

Worth it, go to the beach, look in the sand
Picking up shells to make a barrette
Dream that you are flying on my kite
You are sowing the clouds of carnations

And today I bring you April flowers
Cortaditas come full of colors
And today I give you a day full of sunshine
A drawing, a poem, a rumba
My Collection Bowls

And today, I come to sing to you
With my rhythm and my verses
What I have is nothing more
Oh, pretty star
With your shine you illuminate my whole walk

And today I bring you April flowers
Cortaditas come full of colors
And today I give you a day full of sunshine
A drawing, a poem, a rumba
