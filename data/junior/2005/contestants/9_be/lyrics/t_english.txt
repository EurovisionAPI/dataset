My Dreams

I have always wanted a better world in my heart
To shout it loud and clear with my tenor voice
I always wanted to sing so that things could change
I'm ten years old and I think I'm watching over a lucky star

If you believe in your dreams, a strength within you rises
It's hope that grows, it's life that smiles
If you believe in your dreams so that nothing ends
Let your heart speak, a wink to happiness

By dint of wanting it, also of always believing in it
How many wonders in this world let us protect them every second
Let us therefore wipe out misfortune, all wars and tears
Let's give joy to the children who will soon be grown-ups

If you believe in your dreams, a strength within you rises
It's hope that grows, it's life that smiles
If you believe in your dreams so that nothing ends
Let your heart speak, a wink to happiness

I'm ten years old and I think the world is counting on you
That love and friendship are one unit
That this force will be able to sweep away all the worries
That together we will be stronger to guard all its treasures

If you believe in your dreams, a strength within you rises
It's hope that grows, it's life that smiles
If you believe in your dreams so that nothing ends
Let your heart speak, a wink to happiness

If you believe in your dreams, a strength within you rises
It's hope that grows, it's life that smiles
If you believe in your dreams so that nothing ends
Let your heart speak, a wink to hаppinesѕ
