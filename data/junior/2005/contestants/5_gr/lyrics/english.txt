Now it's our Turn

You watch me grow, you always lead me
But now I just want one thing, with my own eyes for you to see
I believe that now I can give something too
I am not alone, my hand stretches out an ally to find

I want for humanity to search, to warm those who are in pain
And every moment I seize, our hearts speak
Life singing, an opportunity I ask
With what you have taught me, I will continue, with a steady step

Now it's our turn for a fresh start
Power our dreams and what you taught me
Nana nana nana na…

You see me growing, spreading wings
But now I just want one thing, to be close

Now it's our turn for a fresh start
Power our dreams and what you taught me
Now it's our turn for a fresh start
Power our dreams and what you taught me
Nana nana nana yes…

Now it's our turn for a fresh start
Power our dreams and what you taught me
Nana nana nanа yeѕ…
