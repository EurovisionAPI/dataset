Love for Football

I'm leaving the field
In the wind, her hair
Sorry fans
Still, she means more to me

When I played quarterback yesterday, I see that little one is waiting for me
They say that these days the defense is weak
And the coach is angry with me, come on, the lantern is waiting for you
If only he knew what the matter was

I'm leaving the field
In the wind, her hair
Sorry fans
Still, she means more to me

When I played quarterback yesterday, I see that little one is waiting for me
They say that these days the defense is weak
And the coach is angry with me, come on, the lantern is waiting for you
If only he knew what the matter was

She's beautiful when she's waiting for me
She loves me, she loves me the most

I'm leaving the field
In the wind, her hair
Sorry fans
Still, she meаnѕ more to me
