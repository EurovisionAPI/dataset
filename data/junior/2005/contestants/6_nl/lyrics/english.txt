Stupid

Oh…
So stupid

It's that time again, butterflies in the stomach
What do I do with it, I ask him the question
I see him walking and turn around
I'm sure, he must think I'm stupid

How do I find out? Who do I engage?
Who is my best friend?
I really need to know, I can't make it like this
I always act so stupid every time he sees me

We're exercising, I'm running with the ball
If he's in front of me, I'll pretend to fall
He hasn't seen anything, he doesn't even look back
I'm sure now, he must think I'm stupid

How do I find out? Who do I engage?
Who is my best friend?
I really need to know, I can't make it like this
I always act so stupid

It happens to me every time
And it always hurts
I never ask the question, say you like me
I'm never going to be able to do it, I'll always be alone

How do I find out? Who do I engage?
Who is my best friend?
I really need to know, I can't make it like this
I always act so stupid, oh…

(How do I find out? Who do I engage?)
(Who is my best friend?)
I really need to know, I can't make it like this
I always аct so stupid
So stupid every time he seeѕ me
