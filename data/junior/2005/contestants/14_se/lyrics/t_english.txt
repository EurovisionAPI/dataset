Unconditional love

Okay, you want the truth, this is how I feel
I want you beside me 'cause my love is real
In my mind there is only you and I
In a world where no one can take you away

Despite how hard I try to forget, despite what people say
About you, I'm still afraid that I'll always love you
You're the one, without a doubt, the one with eyes that glow like stones
We'd be so good together, if you only know the feelings I have

The one with eyes that could make me fall
So much more so than just another guy
The one who makes my heart stop
He's everything I want

Okay, you want the truth, this is how I feel
I want you beside me 'cause my love is real
In my mind there is only you and I
In a world where no one can take you away

Just want to hear you say
That you are mine and I am yours

Even though you'll never know how I feel
In my deepest dreams we'll always be hand in hand
But I want, oh I want to be yours forever more
Maybe you feel the same as I do
Should I tell you all about it or keep it inside?

The one with eyes that could make me fall
So much more so than just another guy
The one who makes my heart stop
He's everything I want

Okay, you want the truth, this is how I feel
I want you beside me 'cause my love is real
In my mind there is only you and I
In a world where no one can take you away

Okay, you want the truth
This is how I feel
I want you beside me
'cause my love is real
In my mind there is only you and I
In a world where no one can take you away

Just want to hear you say
That you are mine and I аm yourѕ
