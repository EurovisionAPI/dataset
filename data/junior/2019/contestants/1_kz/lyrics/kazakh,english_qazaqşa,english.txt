Armanyńnan qalma

There's a miracle that comes from above
It will help you write your name in the stars
When you have a dream you'll go tirelessly
Don't regret and hold it dear
Only then you'll find the desire of your heart
And if you pursue the dream that's pure
Every soul will root for you

Don't forsake your dream
Thought it's harder than it may seem
Don't forsake your dream
They are here to see you gleam
Don't forsake your dream
Keep on giving it everything
Your heart is glowing from within

Keı-kezde bolmaı
Synaýǵa jandy-aı
Sátsizdik erer qalmaı
Armanyń seniń jarq eter atqan tańdaı

Bar álem saǵan jolyn ashar
Talabyń bolsa taýdaı

Armannan qalma
Bári de oryndalǵansha
Qanatyń seniń talǵansha

Bar álem saǵan jolyn ashar
Armanyń seniń adal bolsa

Armannan qalma
Juldyzyń jaryq janǵansha
Armannan qalma
Alatyn asý qansha
Armannan qalma
Bári de oryndalǵansha
Qanatyń seniń talǵansha
