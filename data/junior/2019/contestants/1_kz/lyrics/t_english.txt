Don't give up on your dream

There's a miracle that comes from above
It will help you write your name in the stars
When you have a dream you'll go tirelessly
Don't regret and hold it dear
Only then you'll find the desire of your heart
And if you pursue the dream that's pure
Every soul will root for you

Don't forsake your dream
Thought it's harder than it may seem
Don't forsake your dream
They are here to see you gleam
Don't forsake your dream
Keep on giving it everything
Your heart is glowing from within

Sometimes not
Ready to test
Failure is inevitable
Your dream is your shining palate

The whole world will open its way to you
If you want, it's like a mountain

Don't stop dreaming
Until everything is done
As long as your wings are thin

The whole world will open its way to you
If your dream is honest

Don't stop dreaming
Until your star shines
Don't stop dreaming
How much is the pass?
Don't stop dreaming
Until everything is done
As long as your wingѕ аre thin

Longing for hope
