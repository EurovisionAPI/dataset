A Time for Us

Let them talk
That someone can be better than us
I don't care, I just want to be myself now
My home is the world
And there are so many beautiful things in it
But wasting his life on success, forgetting about all the
We won't be happier

We're free and bold
It will be difficult and empty
Go and wake the world
Keep on your way

It's time for us, just live
This world without borders, a time of love
Always and everywhere, back to back
Keeping Love in Your Soul
This is the time for us
Only here and now
Always and everywhere, back to back
Keeping Love in Your Soul

It is important to me who we are
And what will remain after us
We are billions of private
As a Whole

It will be difficult and empty
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on

Time has come and it's now, live and keep on
There's no limit for us, as we're strong
To unite all the world, and break every wall
Keep the fire up and burning in our souls
Time has come and it's now
There's no limit for us
To unite all the world, and break every wall
Keep the fire up аnd burning in our souls

This is the time for uѕ
