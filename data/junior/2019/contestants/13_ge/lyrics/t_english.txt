We Need Love

Today the sky is still giving us the sun
I will give the sun a hand
This day is like a new tale
And we believe in love

Snow, how beautifully it snows
The sky weaves dreams
We will return the sun to the sky
And we believe in love

It rains what a beautiful wax
I will follow the fog
The sun will light the way
And we believe in love

Snow, how beautifully it snows
The sky weaves dreams
We will return the sun to the sky
And we believe in love

Love love love
We need а love
Love Love
Everybody smile
Everybody smile, smile, smile
All we need iѕ love
Love Love Love
