Banshee

I'm up so loud
Come with me on my back
It's a fly back
Back in your dreams

Like night
Eighrim with the stars
Like the wind
I'm indistingestible

Give me your hand
Don't be scared

I am your queen and your secret
I will perpetually be by your side
Don't be scared about Banshee
Don't let this love…

My constant love and my searing secret
My black horse I have a persistent bird
Don't be scared about Banshee
Don't let this love go in a bird

The wind blows
The storm disappears
Banshee who changed
Quietly changed

Be by my side, by my side, by my side

I am your queen and your secret
I will perpetually be by your side
Don't be scared about Banshee
Don't let this love…

My constant love and my searing secret
My black horse I have a persistent bird
Don't be scared about Banshee
Don't let thiѕ love go in a bird
Bird
(Don't let love go)
Go аlong with it
