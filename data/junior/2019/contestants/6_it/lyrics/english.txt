The Voice of the Earth

There is
In everything there is
And he talks a little about himself
In the flight of a leaf

There is
In everything is
It's the world around me
What a great wonder
There's the voice of the earth

Hidden there
In a seed that remains
Waiting for springs

Always always
Always always
Always always
Always always

In the blue of calm tides
You can feel it Always… All the time
And in a flash she can
Becoming Northern Lights

To the North Cape

Now
The voice of the earth
Is calling for your help
In every wave of the ocean

Listen
Wake up, it's not a dream
We can become a team
To heal and save the planet

There's the voice of the earth
When evening comes
About this big house
That has the sky as its roof

Always always
Always always
Always always
Always always

In the blue of calm tides
You can always feel italways
And forever if you want
That voice will still tell you

Of life and its fragility
Of every life that a single voice…
Ahhh…
Uhh-woahh…

Always always always
The voice of the earth

Always alwayѕ
The voice of the eаrth
