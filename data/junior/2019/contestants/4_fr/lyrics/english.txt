Bim Bam You

Words fail me
Yet I would like to shout
Mute acrobat with a knotted throat
And it's going up, it's going up, it's going up
Until my little heart broke

And it's going bim, bam, boom
It's pshht and it's vroom
It's like bim, bam, boom
In my head everything is spinning
It sounds shht and then blah blah
It does like this, like that
It's like bim, bam
Ah ah ah
In my heart, I don't understand

It's like bim, bam, there
Bim, bam, there
It sounds like bim, bam, what?
I love you, I think that's it
It's like bim, bam, there
Bim, bam, there
It sounds like bim, bam, what?
I love you, I think that's it
And it's going bim, bam, boom
It's like bim, bam, boom

No matter how hard I try, nothing breaks through
From my closed lips
But I confess, I confess
Inside I explode
And it's going up, it's going up, it's going up
Until my little heart broke

And it's going bim, bam, boom
It's pshht and it's vroom
It's like bim, bam, boom
In my head everything is spinning
It sounds shht and then blah blah
It does like this, like that
It's like bim, bam
Ah ah ah
In my heart, I don't understand

It's like bim, bam, there
Bim, bam, there
It sounds like bim, bam, what?
I love you, I think that's it
It's like bim, bam, there
Bim, bam, there
It sounds like bim, bam, what?
I love you, I think that's it

It would take courage for me to face your eyes
But are we ever wise when we are in love?

And it's going bim, bam, boom
It's pshht and it's vroom
It's like bim, bam, boom
In my head everything is spinning
It sounds shht and then blah blah
It does like this, like that
It's like bim, bam
Ah ah ah
In my heart, I don't understand

It's like bim, bam, there
Bim, bam, there
It sounds like bim, bam, what?
I love you, I think that's it
It's like bim, bam, there
Bim, bam, there
It sounds like bim, bam, what?
I love you, I think it'ѕ thаt
