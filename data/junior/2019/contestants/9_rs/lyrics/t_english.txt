Raise Your Voice

From the first first breath
We're all guests here
In the air and water
The planet gives birth to life
Hunger and war, guess what?

She's been here
Since time has existed
But under this fire
Her lips are silent
The clock is ticking at the last time

Raise your voice in our name
Who live the future together
Raise your voice, do it
Tomorrow will be too late

(Raise your voice
And make a choice)

Have you heard the wind?
And the sad song of the sea
Video of it burning
A Thousand Greens
The world before our eyes will disappear

Raise your voice in our name
Who live the future together
Raise your voice, do it
Tomorrow will be too late

The Earth is the only home for all of us
Raise your voice…

Now raise your voice
And make a choice
Our Earth is hurting now
And that's our only home
Now raise your voice
And make some noise
Time иs running out
The future cannot hold
Raise your voice, do it
Becauѕe tomorrow alreаdy…
