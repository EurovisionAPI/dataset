Ashen

Tea on the porch
Is freezing cold
Another ringtone
Set on my phone
And minutes run just like insane
But only stars shine the same
And between us rainy
Only white water
You're going wet
Without your umbrella
Or you can rush in rain like high
Com on let's do it, babe, change your life
Two, one, zero, do it now

Baby you can't stop
When crazy party's over
Everyone wake up
And push the sound power
I will change your color gray
He-ey
Into the silver and ashen gray
Ashen gray ashen gray
If you gonna glitch
Just do it way more stylish
Remake everything
And gray will become silver
You're very gloom today
He-e-ey
Tomorrow ashen gray, ashen gray
Bright and ashen gray
He-e-ey
Oh oh ohh…

Give me a reason
A change of scenery
The city will Wake up
The other day
I guarantee in advance
Everything will be the Northern lights
And between us rainy
Only white water
You're going wet
Without your umbrella
Or you can rush in rain like high
Com on let's do it babe, change your life
Two, one, zero, do it now

Baby you can't stop
When crazy party's over
Everyone wake up
And push the sound power
I will change your color gray
Into the silver and ashen gray
Ashen gray ashen gray

Hey, open the door
Never-never like before
I'll let you go
Never-never, do you know?
My notes fly as if in a dream
If there is anyone in the world
At least a little on your wave
If you gonna glitch
Just do it way more stylish
Remake everything
And gray will become silver
You're very gloom today
Tomorrow ashen gray, ashen gray
Bright and aѕhen grаy
Hey
Oh oh ohh…
