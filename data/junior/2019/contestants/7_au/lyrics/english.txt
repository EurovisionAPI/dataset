We Will Rise

You know that I'm around
To light you up in the dark
You can fight another round
No this won't tear you apart

Don't give up
We will not back down
We will stand up proud
Don't lose heart
Even in the pain
You gotta try again

Rise
Higher and higher
Up from the fire
Rise
Out of the shadows
Into hope
Rise, rise, rise
We will rise, rise, rise

I see you marching on
Your day has finally come
Lifting up that winner's crown
You're setting fire to the sun

Don't give up
We will not back down
We will stand up proud
Don't lose heart
Even in the pain
You gotta try again

Rise
Higher and higher
Up from the fire
Rise
Out of the shadows
Into hope
Rise, rise, rise
We will rise, rise, rise
When the days are long
And the nights are cold
I will shine my light
We'll be brave and bold
When the nights are cold
I'll be by your side

Rise
Higher and higher
Up from the fire
Rise
Out of the shаdows
Into hope
Rise, rise, rise
We will rise, rise, riѕe
