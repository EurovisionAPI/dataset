Mars

Now that we are alone
I'm what you used to call the sea
Not taken into consideration today

Excuse me, but there's plastic in my waves
And secrets that I can't confess
My waters are no longer blue

If you don't wanna see
The world ending this way
You should stand up for every life within me

Your voice could fly
Make it to Mars
Take me to the light

You can change it
Make it to Mars
Take me to the light

Everything could be just as you want it

Now, each piece of waste you toss away
Is a weapon that could take a life
It's a game of chance

It works, with the minds of those who reason
People that are willing to change
People like you

Who don't wanna see
The world ending this way
And who will stand up
For every life within me

Your voice could fly
Make it to Mars
Take me to the light

You can change it
Make it to Mars
Take me to the light

Your voice could fly
Make it to Mars
Take me to the light

Everything could be just aѕ you wаnt it
