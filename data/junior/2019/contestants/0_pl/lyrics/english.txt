Superhero

Na na na…

Do you know what we're fighting for?
The clock is ticking and the time has come
Spread the love now
Fight for love now, don't judge
Do you know what we're fighting for?

Say yes and share this happiness
The whole world is our home
I know it well I found my place
We've got so many great moments ahead

We are the superheroes, we can save the world
So come together, 'cause together we are one
Let's build a home
A place that we call home, a place that we know
We are the superheroes, we can save the world

Na na na…

I promise you today we can
Sort out the world in the new way, for better days
As long as the fire of hope is burning inside of us
I promise you that life is worth living

Say yes and share this happiness
The whole world is our home
I know it well i found my place
Freedom is our call, it's in my blood

I'll take you above the mountain top
We'll find ourselves again somewhere in the valley of storms
Now I can be free like a wind and dance among the waves
Above us we have sky full of falling stars

I'll take you above the mountain top
We'll find ourselves again somewhere in the valley of storms
Now I can be free like a wind and dance among the waves
Above us we have sky full of falling stars

Na na na…

We are the superheroes, we can ѕаve the world
