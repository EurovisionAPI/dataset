Colours of Your Dream

Heyeyehei
A World of Dreams
That Is for Me and You
Open a new road
Give Me Your Hand
Let My Song Be Sung
Constantly

Where You Are Today
You Are Disrespectful and Silent
I know the secret of joy
You Have to Listen to My Song
And finally find a way out
Dream Colors
Happiness

When you feel life is black-and-white
Paint it clearly in colors

Like Bright Stars
Let Your Eyes Shine
Dye the page of your life with a dream
Come up, I'll give you wings now
I'll forgive the heart of the heavens, and I'll forgive you in color
I'll paint a dream in color

It's a festival, a celebration every day
And most importantly
That thy life may be full of joy
Arise, there is still a lightning in your heart
To Breathe the Fire
But thou shalt believe very much and live in love

When you feel like life is black and white
Take a brush and mix the colours right

Shine on like stars above
Never stop believing in love
Make the magic real
Paint your life with colours of your dream
Come on don't be shy
I'll be teaching you how to fly
We're the greatest team
Paint the world with colours of your dream
Paint the world with colours…

Like Bright Stars
Let Your Eyes Shine
Dye the page of your life with a dream
I'll give you wings now
I'll forgive the heart of the sky in color

Ooh, with colours of your dream
Paint the world with colourѕ of your dreаm
