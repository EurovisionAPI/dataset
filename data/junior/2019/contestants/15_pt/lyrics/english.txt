Come With Me

They say I'm young and I know nothing about life
But if the Earth suffers, we suffer too
It's our home, of all things
And I love everything she gives me

It's so easy to see
That nature is our mother
And she, like us
It's free, it doesn't belong to anyone

Come with me, I can't make it alone
But together, together we're strong

I am young but I know what to do
Time is running out to save the Earth
Come on, be different, we can make it work
Let's make it happen now
Soon it'll be too late, I can't do it all alone
I need you now

I hear it's all normal
That it is a false alarm about global warming
But I'm afraid, I live in a sea of green
That fire and drought can destroy

It's time to wake up
We can go further
Defending everyone together
Our parent company

Come with me, I can't make it alone
But together, together we're strong

I am young but I know what to do
Time is running out to save the Earth
Come on, be different, we can make it work
Let's make it happen now
Soon it'll be too late, I can't do it all alone

We will make it, united forever
I need you, I need you now
Let's come together and be friends forever and
Let's make it happen now…
Let's make it happen

I am young but I know what to do
Time is running out to save the Earth
Come on, be different, we can make it work
Let'ѕ make it hаppen now
