Dance With You

Oh oh…

I'm going into town again tonight
Hoping you'll be there too
I laughed so much with you
But that night went by too quickly

I've been waiting for this for a week
You're still on my mind
I can't stop thinking about your smile
I've called my boys a long time ago
And told all about you
We're going out again tonight

Then I'm sure I'll dance with you
Every day you spin me round and round
You make me float like an astronaut
Let's dance this song together
It's only getting better

I can see your smile again tonight
And your smile enchants me
I can't wait for days
If only I could travel time

I've been waiting for this for a week
You're still on my mind
I keep thinking about your smile (Again and again about your smile)
I've called my boys a long time ago
And told all about you
We're going out again tonight

Then I'm sure I'll dance with you
Every day you spin me round and round
You make me float like an astronaut
Let's dance this song together
It's only getting better
Then I'm sure I'll dance with you
Every day you spin me round and round
Then I'm sure I'll dance with you
Let's dance this song together
It's only getting better

I've been waiting for this for a week
You're still on my mind
I keep thinking about your smile (Again and again about your smile)
I've called my boys a long time ago
And told all about you
We're going out again tonight

Then I'm sure I'll dance with you
You make me float like an astronaut
Let's dance this song together
It's only getting better
Then I'm sure I'll dance with you
Every day you spin me round and round
Then I'm sure I'm dancing with you (That I'm dancing with you)
Let's dance this song together
It's only getting better
Then I'm ѕure I'll dаnce with you
