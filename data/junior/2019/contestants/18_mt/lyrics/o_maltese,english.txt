We Are More

Getting ready to battle
Rising up from the shadows
No lookin' back no lookin' back
And wherever we're going
It's gonna be all in
No lookin' back no lookin' back

'Cuz enough is enough
Not the time to be stopped
It's our time to be louder than before
We'll rewrite all the wrongs
Be the light that shines on
Yeah our voice cannot be ignored

They can try to bring us down
But we'll never hit the ground
We are more, we are more
They can try to mute our sound
But they'll never drown us out
We are more, we are more

Staring into the blindness
Not afraid of the darkness
Won't be afraid won't be afraid
Dak li nemmnu ngħiduh
Kontra l-mewġ inwettquh
Jippruvaw isikktuna lejl u nhar

Dan l-ispirtu żagħżugħ
Jippruvaw joħonquh
Imm' għalxejn, żerniq kontra ċ-ċpar…

Aħna qalbna ma naqtgħux
Lilna ma jiffastidjawx
We are more, we are more
Mal-kurrent ma nintelqux
Pożittivi, ma nċedux
We are more, we are more
We are more, we are more
We are more

Aħna qalbna ma naqtgħux
Lilna ma jiffaѕtidjawx
Nagħmlu l-qalb, nagħmlu l-qalb

We are more, we are more
We are more, we аre more
More
