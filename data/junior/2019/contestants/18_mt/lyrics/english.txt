We Are More

Getting ready to battle
Rising up from the shadows
No lookin' back no lookin' back
And wherever we're going
It's gonna be all in
No lookin' back no lookin' back

'Cuz enough is enough
Not the time to be stopped
It's our time to be louder than before
We'll rewrite all the wrongs
Be the light that shines on
Yeah our voice cannot be ignored

They can try to bring us down
But we'll never hit the ground
We are more, we are more
They can try to mute our sound
But they'll never drown us out
We are more, we are more

Staring into the blindness
Not afraid of the darkness
Won't be afraid won't be afraid
What we believe in saying it
Against the waves we perform it
Trying to silence us day and night

This young spirit
Trying to stifle it
I'm in vain, slipping against fog…

We are heartbroken not to cut
We don't harass us
We are more, we are more
On the current we are not released
Positives, we don't give up
We are more, we are more
We are more, we are more
We are more

We are heartbroken not to cut
They don't faze uѕ
Making the heart, making the heart

We are more, we are more
We are more, we аre more
More
