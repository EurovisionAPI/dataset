The Spirit of Music

When you don't know what to do
When your thoughts are inside out
When it seems like you are all alone
And incapable of flying

When your thoughts are upside down
When you don't know what to do
Inspiration doesn't come
And your heart feels so blue

It seems hoo-oo
It all seems hoo-oo
Forget the sadness hoo-oo
And sing hoo-oo-oo

Hoo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo hoo-oo hoo
Hoo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo hoo-oo hoo
Hoo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo hoo-oo hoo
Hoo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo hoo-oo hoo

When you dance on the dancefloor
You forget about everything
You realize you are one in a circle
The flow is carrying you

It seems hoo-oo
Tt all seems hoo-oo
Forget the sadness hoo-oo
And sing hoo-oo-oo

Hoo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo Hoo-oo hoo-oo hoo
Hoo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo Hoo-oo hoo-oo hoo
Hoo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo Hoo-oo hoo-oo hoo
Hoo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo Hoo-oo ah-ah

And then believe in yourself
Look, the sky is singing
Do you hear the unceasing song?
Feel it to the full

Believe in yourself
Look, the sky is singing
Do you hear the unceasing song?
So sing it silently
Hoo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo hoo-oo hoo

I know it, I feel it
That's the spirit of music
It tаkes me
And sets me free
Hey, I know it
And it's inside of me
I give you thiѕ melody

Hoo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo-oo hoo-oo hoo-oo hoo
