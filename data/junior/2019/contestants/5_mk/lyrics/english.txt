Fire

It all starts with a dream
Anything from here to heaven
And I don't have to say a word
I only listen to it heartily

I'm like a fire, I'm like a fire
The music, it's my passion, it's my life
I'm like a fire, I'm like a fire
Can you feel me now?

Look into my eyes, I've got a zest
I can fly
There are no rules, there are no rules
I'm going to dream

It's easy
If you believe in yourself, everything is easy
No, no
Nothing to break a dream
You can do anything
And I don't have to say a word
I only listen to it heartily

I'm like a fire, I'm like a fire
The music, it's my passion, it's my life
I'm like a fire, I'm like a fire
Can you feel me now?

Look into my eyes, I've got a zest
I can fly
There are no rules, there are no ruleѕ
I'm going to dream

I'm like а fire
