My Childhood Friend

Oh, my childhood friend
Please stay with me
I feel it in my soul now
You don't come again
You're not coming, I know

You are in the heart
In the years after the spring
And in the soul shines like a sun
Full of colors like a rainbow

Child I love you
Mike is precious to me
No, I'll not forget
With songs I sing to you
With dreams and fairy tales
Many rare stories
My heart is full
I'm filled today

You are in the heart
In the years after the spring
And in the soul shines like a sun
Colorful as a rainbow

Child, I love you
It is precious to me
No, I'll not forget
I sing to you
With dreams and fairy tales
Many rare stories
My heart is full
I'm filled today

You will remain love
This child
My heart is lighting
Life gives hope
My friend is fine
You always understand me like every child
Next to me you stand

Child I love you
It is precious to me
No, I'll not forget
With songs I sing to you
With dreams and fairy tales
Many rare stories
My heart is full
I'm filled today

Child I love you
It is precious to me
No, I'll not forget
With songs I sing to you
With dreams and fairy tales
Many rare stories
My heart iѕ full
