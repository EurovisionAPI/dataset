Eooo, Eooo

Eooo, eooo… I don't have a magic lamp
Eooo, eooo… I am not a fairy either
Eooo, eooo… I have a magic song called eooo

I went to England for a cup of tea
In Spain for a corrida
In Paris I climbed the Eiffel Tower
And saw the Leaning Tower of Pisa

I also went to Germany
Denmark, Ireland and Cyprus
I even got as far as Lithuania
Russia, Finland and China

Eooo, eooo… chiri-ba chiri-bu chiri-ba*
Eooo, eooo… chiri-ba chiri-bu chiri-ba
This magic song takes me everywhere
But wherever I go I always come back home

Eooo, eooo… chiri-ba chiri-bu chiri-ba
Eooo, eooo… chiri-ba chiri-bu chiri-ba
This magic song takes me everywhere
But wherever I go I always come back home

I met a sweet guy
In Croatia, Opatija
In Serbia, at Marakana
And I also saw Rihanna

In New York I visited Broadway
In Tokyo I ate sushi
In Singapore and Sydney
I met many soulmates

Eooo, eooo… chiri-ba chiri-bu chiri-ba
Eooo, eooo… chiri-ba chiri-bu chiri-ba
This magic song takes me everywhere
But wherever I go I always come back home

Chiri-ba, chiri-ba, chiri-bu
Chiri-chiri-ba, chiri-ba, chiri-bu
Chiri-ba, chiri-ba, chiri-ba
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu

Chiri-ba, chiri-ba, chiri-bu
Chiri-chiri-ba, chiri-ba, chiri-bu
Chiri-ba, chiri-ba, chiri-ba
Chiri-chiri-bа-ba-ba-ba-bu

Eooo, eooo… I don't have a magic lamp
Eooo, eooo… I am not a fairy either
Eooo, eooo… I have a magic song called eooo

Eooo, eooo…
Eooo, eooo…
Eooo… eooo…

Eooo, eooo… chiri-ba chiri-bu chiri-ba
Eooo, eooo… chiri-ba chiri-bu chiri-ba
This magic song takes me everywhere
But wherever I go I alwayѕ come bаck home
