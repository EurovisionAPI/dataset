My Plane

I don't know where it's better on earth or in the sky
You say no and I say yes
But I know you need to hear your heart
A plane takes off into my heights

The flight is swift and my heart stops
And my head is spinning with happiness
It's not every day that I open the door to the sky
It's my plane, I'm flying it myself

My plane is taking off
I say yes to fate
And every new day
Between the ribbons of songs

My plane, and it's not like that in the sky
And on this plane, I hear the music
My Plane
Uh-uh-uh
My Plane

Tell me that the clouds won't cover the sky
When your image melts in sorrow
What I know is that I don't need any better
I'm on the verge of whims and dreams

Time passes, but the feelings do not go away
And the sun is somewhere far away, between the clouds
I guess I've had enough disappointments
Our life is a continuous PR

My plane takes off
I say yes to fate
And every new day
Between the ribbons of songs

My plane, and it's not like that in the sky
And on this plane, I hear the music
My Plane
Ahhh

My plane takes off
I say yes to fate
And every new day
Between the ribbons of songs
Ahhhh

And every new day
Between the ribbons of songs
My plane, and it's not like that in the sky
And on this plane, I hear the muѕic
My Plаne
