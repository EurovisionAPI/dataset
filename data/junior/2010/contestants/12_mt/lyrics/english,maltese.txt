Knock Knock!....Boom! Boom!

Oh-ho…

Growing up's not heard or seen
Nature reaps in time
Silently and naturally
Just as saying one, two, three
And suddenly…

With one look we see ourselves
Like grown-ups see themselves (Great changes)
And we feel we hold the key
The world's within our reach

Knock, knock-knock
We're here at the door
We've grown, we'll grow more

Hear us knock, knock-knock
Oh yes, here we are
So near and so far, tomorrow's stars

Yesterday has paved the way
To shape us for today (Made changes)
We all had our childhood dreams
Which we all wish to fulfil

Knock, knock-knock
We're here at the door
We've grown, we'll grow more

Hear us knock, knock-knock
Oh yes, here we are
Tomorrow's stars

Bum bum il-bieb, onġi onġi onġella
Bum bum il-bieb, onġi, o kavallier
(Bum bum il-bieb, onġi onġi onġella)

We're here at the door
We've grown, we'll grow more
Hear us…

(Bum bum il-bieb, onġi, o kavallier)
Oh yes, here we are
So near and so far, tomorrow's stars
(Bum bum il-bieb, onġi onġi onġella)
(Bum bum il-bieb, onġi, o kavallier)

Knock, knock-knock
Oh yes, here we are
So near and so far, tomorrow's stаrѕ
