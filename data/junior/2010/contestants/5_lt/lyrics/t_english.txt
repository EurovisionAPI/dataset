Oki Doki

Every day is filled with rhythm
I'm on that paciu road, I'm taking a new step
It's like a dance, feel the dance
It's like a dance, very easy – hey

The music is silent, I hear it alone
And I know the language of dance, what are you waiting for?
It's like a dance, feel the dance
It's like a dance, very easy

Today you will not feel like
Join and it will be different
I'll teach you how to, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…

Oki doki, dance as moki, oki doki, ah…
And further, it will be better and you will feel more and more at ease
Don't stop, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…

It's like dancing very easy – muah
Dance connects, will not stand out never (A-ha)
And it's without a word, a beautiful new language will be born (A-ha)
And it doesn't matter where you are, here or abroad
You understand that you are dancing, you will not even ask, "from where?"

Today you will not feel like
Join and it will be different
I'll teach you how to, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…

Oki doki, dance as moki, oki doki, ah…
And further, it will be better and you will feel more and more at ease
Don't stop, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…

Oki doki, dance as moki, oki doki, ah…
And further, it will be better and you will feel more and more at ease
Don't stop, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…

It's like a dance, feel the dance (A-ha)
It's like a dance, very easy – hey
It's like a dance, feel the dance (A-ha)
It's like a dance, very easy

Today you will not feel like
Join and it will be different
I'll teach you how to, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…

Oki doki, dance as moki, oki doki, ah…
And further, it will be better and you will feel more and more at ease
Don't stop, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…

Oki doki, dance as moki, oki doki, ah…
And further, it will be better and you will feel more and more at ease
Don't ѕtop, oh-oh-oh-oh…

Oki doki – muаh
