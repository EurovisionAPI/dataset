Long Live The Dance (Dance like that)

Why have the winds fallen silent again?
And the clocks keep on running so fast? (tik tak, tik tak, tik tak)
Come to the side of the sun that I know
And just get ready to dance

The password to life is Viva La Dance
And the world – as a minuet old
Turning like this and showing us how
Dance, dance to this - you behold
The password to life is Viva La Dance
And the world – as a minuet old
Whether you have a lot or nothing at all
Dance, dance and dance - you are told

Why have the bells stopped tolling again?
And the hearts started beating so fast? (tuk tuk, tuk tuk, tuk, tuk)
Come to the side of the sun that I know
While the day is still flowing on past

The password to life is Viva La Dance
And the world – as a minuet old
Turning like this and showing us how
Dance, dance to this - you behold
The password to life is Viva La Dance
And the world – aѕ a minuet old
Whether you have a lot, or nothing at all
Dance, dance, dance - you are told

Na na na…
Dance, dance along, dance till the morning light
Dance till the morning light
Dance till the morning light

Viva La Dаnce
