Mama

There's a girl in our yard, she plays the piano
She sees me from a distance, and he turns his way
As soon as I walk by, I get upset, and Walk Away With a Word
I love her, I don't go through her mind

I don't know what else I know she'll greet me and know
That I love her, Mama, tell me now
I don't know what else I know she'll greet me and know
That I love her, Mama, tell me now
Mama, tell me now, Mama

Hey, listen to this song, I've written it to know
There are games in the world, but you don't play with me
I don't like your play, from morning to evening
You practice, and I suffer endlessly

I don't know what else I know she'll greet me and know
That I love her, Mama, tell me now
I don't know what else I know she'll greet me and know
That I love her, Mama, tell me now
Mama, tell me now, Mama

I don't know what else I know she'll greet me and know
That I love her, Mama, tell me now
I don't know what else I know she'll greet me and know
That I love her, Mama, tell me now

I don't know what else I know she'll greet me and know
That I love her, Mama, tell me now
I don't know what else I know ѕhe'll greet me and know
That I love her, Mama, tell me now
Mama, tell me now, Mama

Tell me now, Mamа
