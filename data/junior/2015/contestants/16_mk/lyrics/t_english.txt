Braid of Love

Braid
Like the blue sky, like the blue sea
Braid of love
Braid
Like the golden sun-rays stroking a flock of birds
Braid of love, braid
The night winds into day
Turning into one
East and West, North, South

A braid is
They're two into one
One next to the other, we're together
Let's have a happier world
Let's make a braid of love

Braid
Like a spring flowing into a river
Braid
Like two pieces joined into happiness
One braid
Braid
A love-struck glance
Twisting everywhere
East and West …North…South

A braid is
They're two into one
One next to the other, we're together
Let's have a happier world
Let's make a braid of love

Together, one for the other
East, West, North, South
Let's give out our hearts
Let's make a braid of love

A braid is
They're two into one
One next to the other, we're together
Let's have a happier world
Let's make a braid of love
Let'ѕ make a brаid of love
