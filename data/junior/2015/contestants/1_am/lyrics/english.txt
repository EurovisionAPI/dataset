Love

I woke up today
And I realized again
That our world is a big heart
Tell me, what's in there?
(There is love, there is heart, there is life)
Yes, if there is love
Life is like a musician
Playing the song of your heart
(The most important thing is…)
It's good when love is around you
Love is just spinning

We are in a good mood
Every day is good
Because…
(There is love, there is heart, there is life in this world)
It's good when love is around you
It's strange, how people live without smiling

Wow, once again I've freed my mind
Of negative thoughts, yes
And I've found the secret of happiness
(The most important thing is…)
It's strange
How people live without smiling

We are in a good mood
Every day is good
Because…
(There is love, there is heart, there is life in this world)
It's good when love is around you
It's strange, how people live without smiling

Your heart is an incredible place for love! (Place for love)
The skies are home for the stars above! (Stars above)
Love's a song for me (Love's a song for you)
Love is there to be (Love's for you and me)
L! (L!)
O! (O!)
V, E – LOVE! (V, E – LOVE!)
When I'm in love I go…

We are in a good mood
Every day is good
Because…
(There is love, there is heart, there is life in this world)
It's good when love is around you
It's strange, how people live without smiling

We are in a good mood
Every day is good
Because…
(There is love, there is heart, there is life in this world)
It's good when love is аround you
When it seems like the sun is not shining
Just diѕcover your love
