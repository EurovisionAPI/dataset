First Love

Something strange speaks to the heart
Every time I see you
My time stops when I hear a voice
And when you smile at me

It's a feeling that's unknown to me
There are moments, there are words
But what do you feel?

First love, primo amore
First love should remind me of this December
When we were already aware
That we're both in love
First Love Gives Me Who I Am

There is something strange that I feel inside
My heart was never broken
In the magic land, only butterflies
Our love was never stolen

There in the hallway we meet
All the moments, all the words
Why do I feel this?

First love, primo amore
First love should remind me of this December
When we were already aware
That we're both in love
First Love Gives Me Who I Am

First love, primo amore
We wished our first love for December
It is
First Love Gives Me What I Wаnt

Firѕt love
