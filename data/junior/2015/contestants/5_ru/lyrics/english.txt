Dream

This sky is creeping, and I
I climb higher, where the dream is
And among these star fields
I watch the city of lights

She believes just by her eyes
And will direct the heart to the shores
By what I dreamed, by what I love
I will find this road

You take me higher
Where we will perform our duet
Hurry up to where the wind breathes
And the horizon changes color

In your arms to the sun, you and I
In your arms to the light forever

Take me under the clouds
A white city with a taste of rain
You show me this dawn
And draw me a portrait of thoughts

Behind the back wings are light
Cutting through time on the water
I come back, she's next to me
And I freeze there at the window

You take me higher
Where we will perform our duet
Hurry up to where the wind breathes
And the horizon changes color

In your arms to the sun, you and I
In your arms to the light forever

And you will take me to the blue skies
And we will sing about the place
Where the wind plays with the sunlight
Touching my hair and my face

Into the arms of light we fly
Into the аrms of boundless ѕky
