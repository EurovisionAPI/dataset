Start with Yourself

If you think that people are different
Life is a theater, and eyes are a prism
Then why does the heart rejoice
When another one is beating nearby?
Aa…

When, already on the knees, the soul cries out
To God, having strained its voice
But it is the end already, and how to say:
"I am you sister, brother!"
Aa…

Where is your soul, humanity?
We all have forgotten who we are
The love of each one goes into the mirror
And dissolves there

Who of us did not wish to change
War into peace, the darkness into the light
But nobody wants to recognize
That everybody should start from themselves

Because we all are such saints, we all are so pure
But the truth has a bitter taste
When the black heart does not hear already
"Brother, I love you so much
It is me!"

Humanity, please, no more war
We have forgotten who we are
All our love goes into the mirror
And there dissolved in the dark

All our love goes into the mirror
And there disѕolved in the dаrk
