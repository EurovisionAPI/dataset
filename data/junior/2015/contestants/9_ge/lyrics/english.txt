Dare

The alarm clock will break sleep
Waking up early also breaks
You see the first ray of the sun
Get up and wash your mouth

This is what the dump tells me
I feel lazy
When you see the sun
Do not take the time to sleep

Try to dare
Before you postpone
To Dare Together
What we don't like to do today

Try to dare
Before you postpone
To Dare Together
What we don't like to do today

Outside the house who meet you
Your school friends are
When You Count on Your Head
You also have a new day mug

Dare you, Oo (Dare you, oo)
Dare you, Oo (Dare you, oo)
La-la-la-la-la-la-lo-lo
You must act with yourself

Try to dare
Before you postpone
To Dare Together
What we don't like to do today

Try to dare
Before you postpone
To Dare Together
What we don't like to do today

Try to dare
Before you postpone
To Dare Together
What we don't like to do today

Try – La la-la
Before – La la-la
With That – La La
What we don't have today – La-la-la-la-la-la

Try to dare
Before you poѕtpone
To Dare Together
What we don't like to do todаy
