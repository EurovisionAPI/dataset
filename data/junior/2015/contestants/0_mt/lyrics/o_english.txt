Not My Soul

Feel the fire in you soul
It lets you know
You will never, never be alone

Creating moments
Do your own thing
I'm not trying to fit in
They say sugar and spice makes everything nice
But that don't count for me

Everything means nothing if you don't love what you got in your heart
(What you got in your heart, what you got in your heart)
You feel it in your soul, you can never let it go
I want the world to know

They can take away the rhythm
They can take away the gold
But they can never take away
No they can never take away my soul
No, no, no, not my soul
No, no, no, not my soul
No, no, no, not my soul
No, no, no, not my soul

Now take a minute, can you hear it?
It's the sound of your dreams
You know glitter and bling
It don't mean a thing
'Cause I'm the queen of my soul

Everything means nothing if you don't love what you got in your heart
(What you got in your heart, what you got in your heart)
You feel it in your soul, you can never let it go
I want the world to know

They can take away the rhythm
They can take away the gold
But they can never take away
No they can never take away my soul
No, no, no, not my soul
No, no, no, not my soul
No, no, no, not my soul
No, no, no, not my soul

Try to take away my soul
But what you don't know
There's no way, ey, way, ey
(What you got in your heart, what you got in your heart)

Never take, never take
No they can never take away my soul
No, no, no, not my soul (never take, never tаke)
No, no, no, not my soul (my soul)
No, no, no, not my soul (no, no, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no, not my ѕoul
