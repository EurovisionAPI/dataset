Mirror

Our inseparable souls
Now they don't coincide, the paths change
As if the stars that illuminated us
From up there they no longer reveal themselves
From a time that lets us go away

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Can't you see you're losing control?
I'm not afraid of you anymore
It is now the reflection of another me

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Can't you see you're losing it all?
You don't scare me because
My every flaw is now perfect

Even if you don't answer
Even if every light is turned off
Admit that you will not lose me, because I will be
I will be the music that can't go away

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Can't you see you're losing control?
I'm not afraid of you anymore
It is now the reflection of another me

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Can't you see you're losing it all?
You don't scare me because
My every flaw is now perfect

Even if you don't want to
You will be with me and I will be with you forever
Even if you don't know it
Now I'm here and I'm invulnerable

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Can't you see you're losing control?
I'm not afraid of you anymore
It is now the reflection of another me

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Can't you see you're losing it all?
You don't scare me because
My every flаw iѕ now perfect
