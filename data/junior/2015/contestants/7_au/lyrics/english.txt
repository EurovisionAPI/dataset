My Girls

My best friend's trying like she's never tried before
Her dreams keep fading, I know she has wings to soar
Well, I've been where you are and lost my heart now
But when you're down and out, we'll lift you up

My girls, here we go
One voice and one road
No matter how hard, no matter the scars
You're still beautiful, oh, oh
My girls, here we go

Here we go, oh

A mother loves like only her daughter knows
Do anything for what her future holds
But when I'm down, you'll lift me up

My girls, here we go
One voice and one road
No matter how hard, no matter the scars
You're still beautiful, oh, oh

My girls, here we go
You're never alone
Your hand in my hand
Together we stand
Always beautiful
My girl here we go

It's hard enough to get through all the things we have to
We don't need to fight since we're on the same side
Can't you see the energy ain't feeling jealousy
Can't you see that hate is the enemy? Hate is the enemy

My girls, here we go
One voice and one road
No matter how hard, no matter the scars
You're still beautiful

My girls, here we go
You're never alone
Your hand in my hand, together we stand
Always beautiful, oh, oh
Here we go

One voice, one road
No matter how hard
No matter the scars
You're still beautiful
