Long Live

I can't wait for tomorrow
Have the world locked in your hands
The love that matters
A wave in my dreams

We have everything to be able to fly
But we still don't know where to go
Life is a sea that revolves around us
Night and day
And the sun inside us

Long live the hopes you don't want to give up
Long live the songs you can't sing
Our illusions
The mistakes of youth
Long live the first kiss that makes you tremble
Long live that tear that tastes of salt
Saturday night
Long live your boy band

Long live the caresses of the grandfather who is now up there
Long live the kite that one day I lost in the blue

Laughing so much until you feel bad
Feeling great to be able to leave
Follow what the heart tells us
Studying English
Life is right now… for us

Long live that sunset that makes you dream
Long live the highway that takes you to the sea
Our horizon
The shores of the soul
Long live that speech you can't understand
Long live that summer that doesn't want to end
Long live love
Long live freedom

Long ive the evenings playing around a campfire
Experience your first conquest

Long live the lies you can't tell
It's the secret you can't keep
Leaving school
The wait for the weekend
Experience everything you will remember one day
Long live because the passing of time does not stаnd ѕtill
