Colour of Hope

The world is too gray
Too boring and strict
Indifferent and cold
And for someone – cruel
But I have a great plan
Very easy, very simple
Even just you and I can
Let's bring back the smile to the world again

Let's mix in one
All colors
And so let's color
Dusty cities

Remove the gray and black
Stop for a moment, look up
Here, do you remember – you forgot
There are the colours of hope

Look at the rainbow – it turns into rain
Countless droplets fly in a colorful torrent
And every single one of them, once you touch
Gives birth to thousands of rainbows
In which hope shines again

It's very easy
Each of us can
Alone with his own hands
To cover with a rainbow

All the tired streets
All houses and walls
Go and paint them
Only with the colors of your dreams

Look at the rainbow – it turns into rain
Countless droplets fly in a colorful torrent
And every single one of them, once you touch
Gives birth to thousands of rainbows
In which hope shineѕ agаin
