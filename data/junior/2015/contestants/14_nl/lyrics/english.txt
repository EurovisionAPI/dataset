Million Lights

Gaze over the water
Far away from you
Here we wrote together
In the sand our name
And I remember how you laughed
How you looked and said softly

A million lights up in the sky
Shining for you
A million lights up in the sky
I know you see them too
And I really know better
That I have to be without you
But I can't forget you
Even the distance hurts me

The connection was just better
I can just hear my name
The boundary between the two of us
You live too far away from me
And I remember how you laughed
How you looked and said softly

I just want to be with you oooooooo
I just want to be with you oooooooo
And I remember how you laughed
How you looked and said softly

A million lights up in the sky
A million lights
And I really know better
That I have to be without you
But I can't forget you
Even the distance hurts me
Ohoho
In the sky for you
Ohoho

And I really know better
That I have to be without you
But I can't forget you
Even the distаnce hurts me
A million lights up in the ѕky
