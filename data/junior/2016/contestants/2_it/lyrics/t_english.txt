Dear Mum

These are my words
They have no borders, they have no prison
Old boats carried by the wind
Then collected for a song

I dedicate them to you now and forever
Hoping that one day you can hear them
They have the sounds of a faraway place
Like wings I let them hover

Here the sea speaks of you
Of what you taught me
Of the courage that changed me

You're the strength inside of me
The woman who wanted me
The woman that I will be

These are my words
Paper gliders shining in the sun
Desires for small things
Gears of a single motor

You'll remain my best part
Even when you're a lot less strong
In the nights that beach stars
And when one day I fall in love

Here life is about you
Of what you taught me
Of a time that has already changed

You're the strength inside of me
The woman who waited for me
And that looks a bit like me

And finally here we are
Tonight together again
I find myself in your gaze
And in your face that touches me

I want to tell you mum
All the words that I could never say before
Be the center of my own world
Stay with me and hold me in your embrace

Life is telling about you
The courage that made me change
The things that you said to me

You're the strength inside of me
The woman who waited for me
The woman that I will be

Dear mum, these are my words
They have no border, they hаve no priѕon
