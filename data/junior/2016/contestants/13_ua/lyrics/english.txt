Planet Craves for Love

We live on the planet where fields, groves rustle
Where amid abundant blossom nightingales will sing
Where I run barefoot along an endless field
Where a silver drop plays with the bright sun
Listen to my heart

When a soul wanders through the stars
When it is only one step for us to the sky
Everything I have, I will give it for a dream, and again

And I will fly in every night dream
And feel the tenderness of a warm day
And we will believe that love exists in the world

Welcome, welcome, welcome at least for a moment
Into my soul and into the heart which does not ache because of happiness
Where I will meet you with kind words
And will protect with white wings against miseries
Glow, my heart

When a soul wanders through the stars
When it is only one step for us to the sky
Everything I have, I will give it for a dream, and again

You will see me rising, like butterfly
As I spread my wings, set for the sky
I know in my heart this planet crаveѕ for love
