Follow my Heart

At night, when everyone is already asleep
My dreams are awake, giving me strength
A small voice calls to me from inside
Do not give up, do not hurry, and do not run away

It doesn't matter what they say
You and I are still staying
Now
We're both here together

I know I've gotta follow my heart
I know the way it feels when it's right
Little by little we will learn from almost everyone
How to keep walking
Even if it's a long way

Once I still heard noises
Of people who then told me: You're different
And I have dreams that I will still fulfill
Even if it's a little hard sometimes, I don't break down

Because it doesn't matter what they say
I'll keep singing songs
Now
We're both here together

I know I've gotta follow my heart
I know the way it feels when it's right
I see the light, my dreams are rising in the night
Making me live forever
Making me give the best of me

The heart is never wrong
And it whispers
Let no one put out the fire on me
Eternally
Ho Ho Ho, Ho Ho Ho, Ho Ho Ho
Ho Ho Ho, Ho Ho Ho, Ho Ho Ho

My dreams are rising in the night
Making me live forever
Mаking me give the best of me
The Best of Me (Ho Ho Ho)
The beѕt of me
