Magical Day

Doesn't matter at all where
On earth you were born
If you always pursue your dreams

Doesn't matter at all what is your shooting star
If within yourself you seek peace, not war

Light for you and me
Let's give all children
One magical day

I believe there are miracles
In every fairytale
And I know only love will remain in the world
I believe there are miracles
In every fairytale
Let's give all children
One magical day

Doesn't matter at all
If we are different, you and I
If once in your heart
I can see every color

Doesn't matter at all
Where the road will take us
Sand castles
Together we will build

Light for you and me
Let's give all children
One magical day

I believe there are miracles
In every fairytale
And I know only love will remain in the world
I believe there are miracles
In every fairytale
Let's give all children
One magical day
