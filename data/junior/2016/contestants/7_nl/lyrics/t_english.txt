Kisses and Dancin'

It hasn't been your week or your day
And things aren't going as planned
We know how you can feel the sunny side of life
And to spread it all around the world

You don't know exactly what to do
You don't know how, but it feels right
You don't know exactly what to do

Hey world get up and dance
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Kisses and dancin'
Kisses and dancin' (Clap, clap)
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Kisses and dancin'
Kisses and dancin' (Clap, clap)

C'mon, c'mon, dance, hey
C'mon, c'mon, move your body
C'mon, c'mon, dance, hey
Kisses

Everyone around the world
Dance to the beat, come on and clap your hands
Because this feeling changes everything
You can change your mood in three seconds

You don't know exactly what to do
You don't know how, but it feels right
You don't know exactly what to do

Hey world get up and dance
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Kisses and dancin'
Kisses and dancin' (Clap, clap)
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Kisses and dancin'
Kisses and dancin' (Clap, clap)

C'mon, c'mon, dance, hey
C'mon, c'mon, move your body
C'mon, c'mon, dance, hey
Kisses

Come on we dance and take it easy
Don't think about it too much
World get up and dance

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Kisses and dancin'
Kisses and dancin' (Clap, clap)
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Kisses and dancin'
Kisses and dancin' (Clap, clap)

C'mon, c'mon, dance, hey
C'mon, c'mon, move your body
C'mon, c'mon, dance, hey
