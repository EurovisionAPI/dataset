Water of Life

Tell us what will happen to us
When behind the clouds
Is it completely dark?

My heart is beating
And I, I ask for the sun
For all of us, for all of us

Everyone has all sorrows
If you're with me, I'm not afraid
And clear water
I'll spill all over the planet
I'll spill out…

I'm here, and I'm staying forever, yes, yes, yes
But-but-but-but-no, you're my height
I am, come on, look at me, I-I-I
Living-me-me, living water

Living Water, Living Water, Living Water
Living Water, Living Water, Living Water

Tell me what will happen next
When we get older
With you, with you?

I pray that one day
Everyone on earth has learned
Love

If only all sorrows were aside
If you're with me, I'm not afraid
And clear water
I'll spill all over the planet

We shine
Together we're like
Northern La-la-la-lights
No no no no
We are stars in the sky
Alive
We are the water of la-la-la-life
No no no no
Don't you leave us behind

We shine
Together we're like
Northern La-la-la-lights
No no no no
We are stars in the sky
Alive
We are the water of la-la-la-life
No no no no
Don't you leаve uѕ behind
