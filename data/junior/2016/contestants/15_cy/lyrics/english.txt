Dance Floor

My hands outstretched
And I spin round
My heart belongs to me
My life belongs to me

My hands up
And I reach for the light
The stars are in line
And the sky belongs to me

Look at my step
Which digs into the ground
Around the world
Hearts beat together

It's a small step
But I open my wings
I step on the sun
And reach afar…

My world is a dance floor
My world is a dance floor

My hands outstretched
And I spin round
My heart belongs to me
My life belongs to me

My hands up
And I reach for the light
The stars are in line
And the sky belongs to me

Look at my step
Which digs into the ground
Around the world
Hearts beat together

It's a small step
But I open my wings
I step on the sun
And reach afar…

My world is a dance floor
My world is a dance floor

My heart is beating like a drum
Feel the rhythm

My heart is beating like a drum
Feel the rhythm
This is who I am

My hands outstretched
And I spin round
My heart belongs to me
My life belongs to me

Don't search far off
This is me
This fire
Thiѕ dаnce…
