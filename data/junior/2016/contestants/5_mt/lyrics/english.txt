Parachute

I'll keep chasing rainbows
Searching through the skies for the pot of gold
Remember there's no limit
No end and no beginning

Living for the moments
And all the happy times that we share
We'll make it through the storm
Like fire when it's cold
That's what friends are for after all

When times seem to get hard
I'll never let you down
I'll be your parachute
Yeah I'll take care of you

Until you reach the ground
Till you are safe and sound
I'll be your parachute
Yeah I'll be there for you

Oh oh ohh…
P-P-P-Parachute
Oh oh ohh…

We can last forever
But then again, forever's never enough
Light the sky on fire
We'll keep on going higher

We'll be making memories
And we won't have a minute to spare
We'll keep moving on, together we are strong
That's for friends are for after all

When times seem to get hard
I'll never let you down
I'll be your parachute
Yeah I'll take care of you

Until you reach the ground
Till you are safe and sound
I'll be your parachute
Yeah I'll be there for you

Oh oh ohh…
P-P-P-Parachute
Oh oh ohh…

Let's jump and dive and fly into the sky
We'll ignite the night, like spotlights we will shine
Just like stars, a million lightѕ
Hold tight, oh hold

P-P-P-Parachute
Oh oh ohh…
Oh oh ohh…
