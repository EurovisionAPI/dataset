Believe

Barefoot walking in the sand of melting hope
And as I look around my heart sinks in sorrow
Don't turn my rain in red
Don't bite me with your hate
Let peace serenity guide my tomorrow

Believe, believe
Love will win eventually
Believe, believe
Sun will rise up differently

Let love, let love
Let love, let love
Make the change for you and me
Make the change for you and me

No more birds upon the sky, it is empty
Suddenly my blue sky turned in grey
Why rivers are in red
Why wars don't seem to end
Children with hungry eyes in their motherland

Believe, believe
Love will win eventually
Believe, believe
The sun will rise up differently

Believe, believe
Believe, believe
The sun will rise eventually
The sun will riѕe eventuаlly
