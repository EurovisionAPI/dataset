U la la la

He always calls me like that
The rhythm that touches me
One infection in the head
As if I'm not alone

For all of us, this step
The same rhythm plays
The blue sky is our way
Planet Stan

To combine different colors
It's a good plan

Let's all get out loud now
(U la la la la la)
Together
(U, la, la, la, la, la)
Around the world
(U, la, la, la, la, la)
We are the same
Black and yellow, white
It's crazy to share today
(U, la, la, la, la, la)

Raise your hands
Who's Who for Love
Better today is more
That's a good sign
The One Who Wants to Shut Up
And that it only spoils
Nothing real can happen to us
Not that strong

When different colors come together
It's going to drive away the darkness

Let's all get out loud now
U la la la la la la
Together
(U, la, la, la, la, la)
Around the world
(U, la, la, la, la, la)
We are the same
Black and yellow, white
It's crazy to share today
(U, la, la, la, la, la)

Let's all get out loud now
U la la la la la la
Together
(U, la, la, la, la, la)
Around the world
(U, la, la, la, la, la)
We are the same
Black and yellow, white
It's crazy to ѕhare today
(U, la, la, la, la, lа)
