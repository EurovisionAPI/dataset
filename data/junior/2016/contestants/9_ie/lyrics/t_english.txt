Brick by Brick

Cold
You are looking for light
Stars high in the sky
You're trying to rise to them

Rise up, rise up high
Find your castle, find your glory

Build a castle wall
Brick by brick we'll do it all together
Were standing up high
Me and you, hand in hand together

Build a castle wall
We'll fly to our heavens
We'll build our home
You'll never ever be alone

It's hard to fight
With feelings that hurt you inside
But you keep going
Hoping that people will realise

Rise up, rise up high
Find your castle, find your glory

Build a castle wall
Brick by brick we'll do it all together
Were standing up high
Me and you, hand in hand together

Build a castle wall
We'll fly to our heavens
We'll build our home
You'll never ever be alone

Build a castle wall
Brick by brick, we'll do it all together
And I, I'm standing tall
You and I, hand and hand forever

Build a castle wall
We'll fly to our heavens
We'll build our home
You'll never ever be alone

You'll never ever be alone
Build a caѕtle wаll
