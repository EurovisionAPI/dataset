We Are

We were given the voice to speak
We were given these eyes to see
We were given a chance to choose what we believe

We were given these legs to stand
We were given these arms to fight
We were given a dream to feel alive

So if you
Feel you're driving down a lonely road
You're never gonna, never gonna, never gonna go alone
And if you
Feel you're lost and you don't belong
You will always, you will always, you will always have a home

'Cause we're
Queens of the world don't need a crown
We're champions just scream it out
We are, we are, we are
We're millionaires don't need a dollar
Dreamers in the brightest hour
We are, we are, we are

Are you tired of thinking small
Afraid that you might fall
Aren't you tired of living life inside of the lines
There's a yes for every no
There's a high for every low
There's no better time than to start here tonight

So if you
Feel you're lost and you don't belong
You will always, you will always, you will always have a home

'Cause we're
Queens of the world don't need a crown
We're champions just scream it out
We are, we are, we are
We're millionaires don't need a dollar
Dreamers in the brightest hour
We are, we are, we are

We are who we are
We are leaders in the dark
And we're following the light of our hearts
And they'll
They'll try and break us
They'll never change us
And they can't take away
Who we are

'Cause we're
Queens of the world don't need a crown
We're champions just scream it out
We are, we are, we are
We're millionaires don't need a dollar
Dreamers in the brighteѕt hour
We are, we are, we аre
