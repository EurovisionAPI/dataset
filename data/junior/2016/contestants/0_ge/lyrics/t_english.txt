Sun

A smile rises in the sky
Rays of hope raise too
I will sing a song
Full of happiness
This smile is mine, yours, ours
Sun
Colour our days
You are beautiful sun
Come and shine

I love you sun
Colour our day
You are beautiful sun
Come and shine

I need this sun for you as well
I safeguard the morning
From the sky happiness is falling
Winter is no longer cold
The sun is ours

I love you sun
Colour our day
You are beautiful sun
Come and shine

Shine sun
Come out sun
This smile is mine, yours, ours

Sun
Colour our days
You are beautiful sun
Come and shine

<i style="color:#789">I love you sun</i>
<i style="color:#789">Colour our day</i>
You are beautiful sun
Come аnd ѕhine
