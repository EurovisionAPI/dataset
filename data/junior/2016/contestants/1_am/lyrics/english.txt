Different

I have my own style, I'm always classy
Only black and white colors In my wardrobe
My style is different, I'm crazy and free
Combining colors and shades

Always arguing
We have our ways
We don't see each other
But deep inside

Music is what's important
It's our passion, it's different
But in our eyes
There is love and laughter
Every day is full of light
As long as the sun is in our heart, always

I'm stylish and elegant
You're always jealous of my hair
I'm sporty and trendy
I'm daring, a vivid spirit, not orderly
Always arguing
We have our ways
We don't see each other
But deep inside

Music is what's important
It's our passion, it's different
But in our eyes
There is love and laughter
Every day is full of light
As long as the sun is in our heart, always

You and I are different
We're different worlds
But come on
You and I are one
We are best friends

I said we will always have our own ways
Because we are different, but not indifferent
We will always live in one space
Because love iѕ bigger than аny difference
