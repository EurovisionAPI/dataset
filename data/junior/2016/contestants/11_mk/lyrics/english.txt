Love will Lead Our Way

When You want something
It will come one day
Just dream and be
Infinitely grateful
For the memories that carry you know
To beauty, sincere desires
And for life, all the changes
Secret Loves

Love will lead our way
Play around and pray
Trust and Go
Love Doesn't Lead
Love will lead our way, oh…

When you want something badly
Surely one day will come

Your memories that carry you know
To the beautiful, they know best
Life, all the changes
Secret Loves

Love will lead our way
Play around and pray
Trust and Go
Love Doesn't Lead

Love will lead our way
Play around and pray
Trust and Go
Love Doesn't Lead

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Would you let the love lead our way?
Hey, hey, hey
Would you let the love lead our way?

Oh… Trust and go
Love Doesn't Lead

Love will lead our way
Play around and práy
Love Doeѕn't Leаd
