Music of my victories

Every sound beats
Every noise hits
Music's filling all the spaces on the streets

This is my way
That's what I play
Reading out every sound day by day

In the world of sound lines
I want to leave mine
Nothing stops of doing it right

No matter
Funk, rock, punk, reggae and hip-hop
Rap, jazz, soul, country, maybe pop
How to decide what I'm gonna play?
But I know the answer, music is my only way

Going up high
Learning to fly
I will raise my flag of music to the sky

This is my way
That's what I play
Reading out every sound day by day

In the world of sound lines
I want to leave mine
Nothing stops of doing it right

No matter
Funk, rock, punk, reggae and hip-hop
Rap, jazz, soul, country, maybe pop
How to decide what I'm gonna play?
But i know the answer, music is my only way

This is folk, this is rock, this is my light
Breaking silence all the night till the sunlight
This is funk, this is punk, this is my light
Choosing music of my life till the sunlight
This is jazz, this is trance, this my light
Breaking silence all the night till the sunlight

No matter
Funk, rock, punk, reggae and hip-hop
Rap, jazz, soul, country, maybe pop
How to decide what I'm gonna play?
But i know the answer, music iѕ my only way

My way
My way
My wаy
