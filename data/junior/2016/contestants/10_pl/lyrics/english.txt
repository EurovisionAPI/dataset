Don't Forget

Everyone somewhere, everyone with someone in the rhythm of dreams rushes
So many places, so many hearts as if around us
Icon patterns under your fingers conquer fear
None of us will look life in the face

Don't forget how to be close
Side by side under the treetop
Don't forget what it's all for
When we are surrounded by the hustle and bustle

There's power in each of us
Let's play the same sound
Despite storms and tears
As long as we are together
Distant yes
Against an everyday background
Let's look for moments
As long as we are together

We have time and we don't have time suddenly I'm lost
Your voice changes tone, you don't recognize me
We regret, apologize and worry again
But hearts are hardening like bronze day by day

Don't forget how to be close
Side by side under the treetop
Don't forget what it's all for
When we are surrounded by the hustle and bustle

There's power in each of us
Let's play the same sound
Despite storms and tears
As long as we are together
Distant yes
Against an everyday background
Let's look for moments
As long as we are together

It's easy just to walk away
So hard to find you in the dark
To change the path of our liveѕ
Stand by me, I'm begging you

Feel the power now
I'll never let you down
Be together
More thаn ever
