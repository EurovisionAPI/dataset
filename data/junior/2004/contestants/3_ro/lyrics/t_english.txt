Thank you

You are my first love
You were also the first voice
You're smiling taught me
And trust you gave me
Let me take the first step

You are my first memory (My mother, only you)
You are the fairy of fairy tales (My mother, only you)
You, mother, watched over me
And tumultuous sleep
Dreaming of caroling

Thank you, my mother
(Thank you, my mother)
Thank you with my life
(Thank you)

(I give it to you, my mother)
I give it to you, my mother
Through song, all love

You are my first light (You are my star, only you)
You are my universe (It was always just you)
You've always been there
You've protected me
From all that iѕ evil

Only you are my good angel
And I'd like to tell you
Mother, thank you (Mother, thаnk you)
Mother, I love you…
