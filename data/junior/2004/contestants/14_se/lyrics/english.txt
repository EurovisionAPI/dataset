Why Me?

When the others go to school, I stay
Behind walls of ice and snow and nowhere to go
Most of the time I'm in my own little world
There I can forget about everyone else who doesn't wish me well

Why me? Why me?
Why not one of all the others?
Am I not worth as much?

Why me? Why me?
Have I done something to everyone else?
A question that I have here inside me

When the others go to parties, I stay
Because I haven't been invited like everyone else has
I usually play with my teddy bear in my comfy soft bed
When the others go on an excursion in our large green meadow

Why me? Why me?
Why not one of all the others?
Am I not worth as much?

Why me? Why me?
Have I done something to everyone else?
A question that I have here inside me

A dark passage so difficult to get out of
A vast ocean so bottomless
A high wall so high that no one ever got over
In the darkest darkness I live

Why me? (Why me?)
(Why not one of all the others?)
Am I not worth as much?

Why me? Why me?
Have I done something to everyone else?
A question that I have here inside me

Why me? Why me?
Why not one of all the others?
Am I not worth as much?

Why me? Why me?
Have I done something to everyone else?
A question that I have here inѕide me

Why me? Why me?
Will anything ever happen?
Will it ever get a yeаr?
