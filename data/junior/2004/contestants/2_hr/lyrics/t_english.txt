Hey little boy

Every morning when I wake up
I think of you, and I say to myself
I'm going to school today and I'm going to see him again
And he's going to look at me like never before

Hey little boy, how I miss you
Hey little boy, my eyes are looking for you
Hey little boy, do you know I love you
And you're just looking at me

Hey little boy, how I miss you
Hey little boy, my eyes are looking for you
Hey little boy, do you know I love you
And you're just looking at me

I told my dad my secret today
And he was very surprised
'Cause I've never loved like that before
Like this time

Hey little boy, how I miss you
Hey little boy, my eyes are looking for you
Hey little boy, do you know I love you
And you're just looking at me
And you and you…

Hey little boy, how I miss you
Hey little boy, my eyes are looking for you
Hey little boy, do you know I love you
And you, you, you, you, you

And you, you, you, you, you
You're juѕt looking аt me
