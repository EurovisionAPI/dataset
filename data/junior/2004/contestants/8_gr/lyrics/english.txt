My Old Self

Every time I look at you
I erase the tears from my mind
You avoid me and ask me not to speak
To forget my old self

I can't look at you
And the world to change
If you don't let me, let me dream of you
Oh… to dream of you, my heart
Oh… to dream of you

I wish you knew your heart
I didn't ask for much
But is my mind seriously stuck?
From your magical blue gaze

I can't look at you
And the world to change
If you don't let me, let me dream of you
Oh… to dream of you, my heart
Oh… to dream of you

With a kiss of yourѕ baby I will take off
Oh… I will take off, my heart
Oh… I'll take off

I can't look at you
And the world to change
If you don't let me, let me dream of you
Oh… to dream of you, my heart
Oh… to dreаm of you
