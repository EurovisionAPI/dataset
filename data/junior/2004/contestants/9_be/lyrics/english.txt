Hang in There

It is another dreamless night
I have to stop, I want to make a truce
Now I'm fed up, I'm going crazy
This time I think I'm at the bottom of the hole

How do we get out of here
There is no sign indicating the exit
I wish it was all over
I even get a taste for life more

Hang in there, you still can
Hang in there, go ahead and make an effort
Hang in there, you won't regret it
You'll see, it'll be fine

I thought about committing suicide
But the idea scared me
I looked for a good remedy
Someone to ask for help

In the end, I got through it
The course of my life has resumed
To you who are desperate
You'll see, everything can be arranged

Hang in there, you still can
Hang in there, go ahead and make an effort
Hang in there, you won't regret it
You'll see, it'll be fine

Hang in there, you still can
Hang in there, go ahead and make an effort
Hang in there, you won't regret it
You'll see, it'll be fine

Hang in there, you still can
Hang in there, go ahead and make an effort
Hang in there, you won't regret it
You'll see, it'll be fine

Hang in there, you still can
Hang in there, go ahead and make an effort
Hаng in there, you won't regret it
You'll ѕee, it'll be fine
