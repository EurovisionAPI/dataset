Power of a Song

There's magic in each song
It can make friendship so strong
Come on, share your music with me

There's power in each song, eh
It makes you sing along
Oh girl, what a beautiful world

Hear the music, keep the rhythm
Dance, and enjoy the sunshine
Hear our voices, hear our stories
Hear, what we've gotta tell you, dance

Get the message of a song
It can teach you right from wrong
So boy, don't you mess up your life

Like a rainbow in the sky, ah
A song brightens up your life
Enjoy, we've got so much to give

Hear the music, keep the rhythm
Dance, and enjoy the sunshine
Hear our voices, hear our stories
Hear, what we've gotta tell you, dance

Ohh ohh…
Dance with me

There is magic in each song
And there is power in our song
Get the message of a song
Enjoy life, enjoy life

Hear the music, keep the rhythm
Dance, and enjoy the sunshine
Hear our voices, hear our stories
Hear, what we've gotta tell you

Hear the music, keep the rhythm
Dance, and enjoy the sunshine
Hear our voices, hear our stories
Hear,what we've gotta tell you

Dance, let'ѕ dаnce
