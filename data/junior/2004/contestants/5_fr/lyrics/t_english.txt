If we really wanted to

Every day I wake up full of hope and illusion
But the news bring me back, bring me to my senses
I am the one who believes in man and hope in life
I only hear lies and sad stories

Step by step I'm going through life
To seek my way, to know who I am
I am often told that we must always say "yes"
I don't want to believe that everything is already written

Everything could be so good if we really wanted to
Everything could be so good if only we wanted it right

I would like to take the time to learn and understand
But what does this world want and what does it have to sell me
It has the time the time of my life to amaze and surprise me
But I want children's laughter and to see your tender look

Everything could be so good if we really wanted to
Everything could be so good if only we wanted it right

Step by step I'm going through life
To seek my way to know who I am
I don't want to believe that everything is written
I want to believe in man and hope in life

Everything could be so good if we really wanted to
Everything could be so good if only we wanted it right

Everything could be so good, if we really wanted to
Everything could be ѕo fine if only…
If only, if only we wаnted it right
