The Girl is Mine

She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
Who should I choose now?

Hey beautiful girl, there's something I have to tell you
Your sweet smile, it's just me
If only we could weave our fingers in secret
I'll never break your heart
Hey yo, what's honey, let me make it clear
You shouldn't have a tablecloth, rather one that is smart
Who gives pants water to the nice boys in the class
Wears big pants and stays up late at night

She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
Who should I choose now?
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
Who should I choose now?

You must choose me, I will give you red roses
Love and a poem with sweet words
No, you have to choose me - we fit together
Let's listen to loud music and dance the night away
Yo, put your hand in mine, let's go for a walk in the sand
Love spreads like ripples in water
I can see you blush when I look at you
Your thoughts are with me

She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
Who should I choose now?
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
Who should I choose now?

Ho-ho, Cool Kids, Cool Kids
Ho-ho, Cool Kids, Cool Kids
Uh-ah, uh-ah
Uh-ah, uh-ah

It's about time, you choose me and not him
I'm standing by your side, and you don't fit in
You deserve more, why are you in doubt?
What do you want with him? He has no life
And I deserve you, you should be able to see that
Have better style, and then I could be woeful
Who do you want? Who is the right one?
Give us an answer - you can't sing your way out of it

She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
Who should I choose now?
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-na-na
She's mine, she's mine, na-na-nа
Who should I choose now?

She'ѕ mine
