I'm gonna be a Star

I sat down in my room to make a song
A song that would make me popular
But it was quite difficult, I soon realized that
But one song – I was going to make it

I tried many times but everything just went wrong
Same ass what I wrote
At night I lay awake, I became completely desperate
Because the song had to be good
Because the song had to be good

I'm gonna be a star, oh yes
Then there is no other thing to say, oh yes
Then I have to show that I can sing
And write songs like a man
Then I just become known and popular

But then one early morning I woke up by myself
In the moonlight of the night, everything came into place
The words they just rolled out of my head
And then it was all started
And then it was all started

I'm gonna be a star

I'm gonna be a star, oh yes
Then there is no other thing to say, oh yes
Then I have to show that I can sing
And write songs like a man
Then I juѕt become known and populаr
