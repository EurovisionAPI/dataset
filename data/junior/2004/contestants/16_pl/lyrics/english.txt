Catch Life

Catch life, catch
You only live once

Let's catch the day like a fruit from a tree
Like a juicy dessert
We catch the day so that before the night
Enjoy the colour, catch the shine

Grab it and pass it, new fashion
To score a goal in dreams
To experience and touch, let it be bitter
Drink life with a ghost

Do not wince when the tart aftertaste
You ate a sour fruit
You felt that this taste moves you
It's not a sweet candy with an artificial taste

Grab it and pass it, new fashion
To score a goal in dreams
To experience and touch, let it be bitter
Drink life with a ghost

Catch life, catch, drink life, drink
You only live once
Catch life, catch, drink life, drink
You only live once

Grab it and pass it, new fashion
To score a goal in dreams
To experience and touch, let it be bitter
Drink life with a ghost

Grab it and pass it, new fashion
To score a goal in dreams
To experience and touch, let it be bitter
Drink life with a ghoѕt

Catch life, cаtch
