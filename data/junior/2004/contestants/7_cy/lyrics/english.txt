Dreams

I shut myself in the room alone
And I listen to the radio and I dance all the time
Lights everywhere, music and rhythm
And you don't believe it in my mind

Enough time tonight
Party to have too
To come back to see you
What if I'm a shy kid?
Maybe I'll tell you, I love you

I dream and go crazy
At the party where I see you and get dizzy
Your eyes look and travel
That's all I want to dance with you

I dream and go crazy
At the party where I see you and get dizzy
Your eyes look and travel
That's all I want to dance with you

Dress up and comb
I am ashamed, I hide the words, I lose
I wrote you a song
Let me tell you sweetly on a piano

Color fills the heart
And it all beats loudly
To come to you again
What if I'm a shy kid?
Maybe I'll tell you I love you

I dream and go crazy
At the party where I see you and get dizzy
Your eyes look and travel
That's all I want to dance with you

I dream and go crazy
At the party where I see you and get dizzy
Your eyes look and travel
That's all I want to dance with you

I dream and go crazy
At the party where I see you and get dizzy
Your eyes look and travel
That's all I want to dance with you

I dream and go crazy
At the party where I see you and get dizzy
Your eyes look and travel
That'ѕ all I want to dаnce with you
