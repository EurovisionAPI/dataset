Cheeky

I'm a kid, I'm a bit cheeky
And sleep I don't know what it is
I'm a child, maybe I'm small
And I want to be with you

Come on, play, please, don't think
Come on, sing with me again

Mum, I want to play
Let me have a little fun
How about singing
I don't want to sleep

Mum, I want to play
Let me have a little fun
How about singing
I don't want to sleep

Mum, I want to play
Let me have a little fun
How about singing
I don't want to sleep

Mum, I want to play
Let me have a little fun
How about singing
I don't want to sleep

Mum, I want to play
Let me have a little fun
How about singing
I don't wаnt to ѕleep
