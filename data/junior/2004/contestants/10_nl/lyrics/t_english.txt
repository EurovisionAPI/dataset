He's the Best

We have a new boy in the class
And his name is Bas, and his name is Bas
We have a new boy in the class
And his name is Bas, and his name is Bas

He's top of the class
He is happy with arithmetic
He is also very happy with language
Because he can do that even better than me

He's the best, he's the best, I think
I have a crush on him
He can tell so beautifully with that beautiful voice
I love him, but does he love me?

He's really not a fighter
But maybe, unfortunately
He's not on me, but I'm on him
And that counts, and that counts
I love him

He's the best, he's the best, I think
I have a crush on him
He can tell so beautifully with that beautiful voice
I love him, but does he love me?

He lent his pencil to me today
And I was happy, and I was happy
But what I saw today
Was shocking, but true

He asked her to go on a date
She, who used to be my girlfriend
And he who used to be my love

But who do I see there
Thomas is coming
I've never noticed how handsome he is
And he asks me to date and I say yes

He's the best, he's the best, I think
I have a crush on him
He can tell so beautifully with that beautiful voice
He'll alwаys be my idol

He's the beѕt
