The Best Is Yet to Come

As I sit here alone, been sleeping with the light on
And I think to myself, mankind has got it wrong
And I know in my mind if tomorrow never comes
We must all join hands as one

People say the time will come when there's peace throughout the world
And I hope and I pray no one spoils a better day
Make a stand, make it right, say the voices of our hearts
For the best is yet to come

Join hands and unite, the future's looking bright
Hear it in the lyrics of the music that I write
We can build this dream together, you know it's worth the fight
Let's stand as one thoughout the world
And I know this time we'll get it right

We will all see the time when mankind has got it made
And I know long ago seemed like yesterday
But the future we build, we'll see children laugh and play
So now the time has come

Join hands and unite, the future's looking bright
Hear it in the lyrics of the music that I write
We can build this dream together, you know it's worth the fight
Let's stand as one thoughout the world
And I know this time we'll get it right

Join hands and unite, the future's looking bright
Hear it in the lyrics of the music that I write
We can build this dream together, you know it's worth the fight
Let's stand аs one thoughout the world
And I know thiѕ time we'll get it right
