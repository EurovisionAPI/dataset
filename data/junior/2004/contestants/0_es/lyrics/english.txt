Rather dead than simple

Lipstick
Touch of mascara
Moulder
Like a film artist

Hair salon
Moisturiser
And make up that's instant beauty
Open the door, we're going to the street
Who cares what they say out there

I'd rather be dead than simple, oh how simple, oh how simple
I'd rather be dead than simple, oh how simple, oh how simple

And it's the truth because that's who we are
We like to be fashionable, we like to show off
What does it matter to us if you say about me
From London, Milan, San Francisco or Paris

And we've come to dance
To laugh and enjoy
After so much work
That sometimes women need
A little, a little, a little, a little freedom

Lots of stews, from the old days
That's why I move like this with a lot of art
And if a boyfriend gets infront of me
I'll dance to it for a while
And a few drops of Chanel No 4
What's cheaper
Who cares what they say out there

I'd rather be dead than simple, oh how simple, oh how simple
I'd rather be dead than simple, oh how simple, oh how simple

And it's the truth because that's who we are
We like to be fashionable, we like to show off
What does it matter if you say about me
From London, Milan, San Francisco or Paris

And we've come to dance
To laugh and enjoy
After so much studying
That sometimes women need
A little, a little, a little

And we've come to dance
To laugh and enjoy
After so much work
That sometimes women need
A little, a little, a little, a little freedom

I'd rather be dead than simple, oh how simple, oh how simple
I'd rather be dead thаn simple, oh how simple, oh how ѕimple
