Planet of the Children

I want to be someday
Fairy or superhero
All the people of the world
I want to turn them into children

And believe me
That all alone
This World We Will Change

It will be a children's planet
No hunger and fear and war
It will be a children's planet
Our land

It will be a children's planet
Hope, Peace, Light
It will be a children's planet
The most beautiful dream

It's not just a dream
It's not a small fairy tale

Oh, trust me
That all alone
This World We Will Change

It will be a children's planet
No hunger and fear and war
It will be a children's planet
Our land

It will be a children's planet
Hope, Peace, Light
It will be a children's planet
The most beautiful dream

Children's Planet
Children's Planet, Our Earth
Oh…
It will be a children's planet
The moѕt beautiful dreаm
