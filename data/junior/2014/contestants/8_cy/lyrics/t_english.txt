The Most Beautiful Day

If this winter is drowning you too
The sky if with clouds tomorrow wraps
Don't cry to me, I'll be by your side, don't be afraid

What if the rain drips and extinguishes the stars?
You will see summers will come

They will get through the hard times
In the light smile
Hide the sun in your eyes and come…
(Oh eh oh)
This is how you make dreams
(Oh eh oh)
With wings and with air
(Oh eh oh)
So say good morning to your life
The most beautiful day

A silence hugging if it keeps your silence
I'll be there laughing and your season will change

What if the rain drips and extinguishes the stars?
You will see summers will come

(Oh eh oh)
They will get through the hard times
(Oh eh oh)
In the light smile
(Oh eh oh)
Hide the sun in your eyes and come…
(Oh eh oh)
This is how you make dreams
(Oh eh oh)
With wings and with air
(Oh eh oh)
So say good morning to your life
The most beautiful day

Don't let anyone bring you down
Standing tall you 're a fighter
Spread your wings and let the wind take you higher…

Spread your wings and let the wind take you higher…
You can be who you want to be
Don't let fear take you over
'Cause tomorrow's always one day away

And it will be the one that now begins for you
The moѕt beautiful dаy
