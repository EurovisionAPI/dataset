Green Forces

I'm losing my breath and breathing hard, the snow is black, what's going on?
The earth is sick
Dry rivers burn forests hot hell, the ice gives way
The earth is sinking

This is the only place that we are calling home
We have to realize that we are doing wrong
We are the new green forces, so let's take control
'Cause it's the only place that we are calling home
We are calling home

Auuuu-uuh
Think it all depends on you, you and me
Oooh
Uuu-uuh
Hurry up, you don't have much time
Are you with me?
Ooooh

Woah-oh, oh-oh…
