Fairy World

It's a very special voice, as it is called from a distance
Horticultural gardens, stones, greenery, water
Zu with a rodent

Be alarmed
Call armpits
You believe in the fairy tale world and take it with you
I'm not going to do it
I'll be next to you
Do you have a free will or indentation

On this path, luck smiles on us
We must not
Never give up I found
The strength in me
Believing in fairy tales
And there is a place
For you too Take my hand
If you want it

I'm sure, just for you
You'll show me the way
You're the shelter I need
We will go hand in hand
I'm melting from your head
You'll show me the way
This side is "Fairy Tale World"
We will go hand in hand

Be alarmed
Call armpitѕ
You believe in the fairy tale world and take it with you
I'm not going to do it
I'll be next to you
Do you have a free will or indentаtion
