Somebody

We're caught in
Dark nights in the silence
Drowning in the deep end
Calling to the sky
Too many times

As roses
Can grow beneath a pavement
I'd swim a hundred oceans
You'll never walk alone
I'll be there

No one will feel alone
This good world will hug us in our arms
Beyond what inspires fear
I am waiting for you and I am
Please hear my voice
I'll wait
Night will turn into day
I'm waiting
It's worth it for you, I know
Wait

Now we sail into the future
We have love in us
Which breaks down the wall of bitter words

What will be
Is still important
The truth will find us
And it will lead you where you will never go again

When your heart's to heavy to hold
And you can't find the words to tell me
I'd run every mile between us now
Just to let you know somebody's waiting
Somebody's waiting for you
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting
Somebody's waiting for you
I'm waiting

Time goes by, don't be afraid
Anyway I know
What is bad will pass
Once upon a time, someone just like us
Told me
That anything is possible
Oh oh oh

Please hear my voice
I'll wait
Night will turn into day
I'm waiting
It's worth it for you, I know
Wait

Somebody'ѕ wаiting for you
