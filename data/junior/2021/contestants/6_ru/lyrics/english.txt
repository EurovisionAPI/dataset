Mon Ami

Mon ami, let me hear
The sound of your voice deep inside
Dance with me, you can feel
The rhythm of your heart will fly

Turn to me, music can heal
I know how it feels
Just sing with me la la la

Come to me
Mystery listen to your heart tonight
Let's be free
Mon ami, feels like a fairytale

Follow me
You will see, magic will happen tonight
Imagine it
Finally no one can stop us now

Anytime, I came through
Time is not waiting for you
Tell me anyway you gonna do
If you lose a chance make it through

Turn to me, music can heal
I know how it feels
Just sing with me la la la

Come to me
Mystery listen to your heart tonight
Let's be free
Mon ami, feels like a fairytale

Follow me
You will see, magic will happen tonight
Imagine it
Finally no one can stop us now
Finally no one can stop us now

I'm feeling the melody inside my soul
This moment will pass and you'll attain your goal
It rains but it doesn't erase memories
Let's love and just live

Come to me…
(Mystery listen to your heart tonight)
Let's be free…
(Mon ami, feels like a fairytale)

Follow me
You will see, magic will happen tonight
Imagine it
Finally no one can stop us now…
Finally no one cаn stop uѕ now…
