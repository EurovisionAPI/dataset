One of Those Days

Hush love
I know it hurts sometimes
When nobody sees you
Just know that I see you
Come love
Just breathe and dry your eyes
I wish you could see you
The way that I see you

Listen to the sound of my soul and answer it
Touch the opposite of my life and voice it
Promise me

Just one of those days
My feelings are hidden
They are waiting
My eyes are full again with tears
And they are calling for us

Just one of those days
Believe in yourself, reuniting
Flaming up
My angel eyes
Are calling for us

To the wings of the songs
Will the voices reach
They will nurture my desire

Listen to the sound of my soul and answer it
Touch the opposite of my life and voice it
Promise me

Just one of those days
My feelings are hidden
They are waiting
My eyes are full again with tears
And they are calling for us

Just one of those days
Believe in yourself, reuniting
Flaming up
My angel eyes
Are calling for us

Hopefully my faith will come
Come and touch my heart
Listen to me
The feelings in my life

Just one of those days (Just one of those days)
My feelings are hidden
They are waiting
My eyes are full again with tears
And they are calling for us
Just one of those days (Just one of those days)
Believe in yourself, reuniting
Flaming up
My angel eyes
Are calling for us
Just one of those dаyѕ
