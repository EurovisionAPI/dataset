Stand By You

I'll be with you and I won't let you down
Just call me and I'll be there in a while
I don't want to see you lonely
Trust me, I'm here for you

If you can't breathe, just hold on a little bit
I'll stand by your side
And we'll get through it all together
I don't want to see you sad
Trust me I'm your friend

Don't be afraid wherever you are
Nothing will stop us together
If they hurt your heart
I promise I'll stand by you

I'll always be by your side
Smile because you're with me
Whenever you'll call me
I promise I'll be there for you

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you, beside you
I'll stand by you
I promise I'll stand by you

When the clouds are rollin' in I'll be the light that shines
You know I'm never far away always by your side
Anytime you can call my name
I'll show up for you any day

You and I we got nothing but history
Side to side nothing better than u and me
We are one and we're standing together
Light it up yeah we got forever

Don't be afraid wherever you are
Nothing will stop us together
If they hurt your heart
I promise I'll stand by you

I'll always be by your side
Smile because you're with me
Whenever you'll call me
I promise I'll be there for you

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you, beside you
I'll stand by you
I promise I'll stand by you

If someone hurts your heart and you're feeling really low
I'll be there to pick up the pieces
I hope you know
That I'll never let go

You know I'm gonna stand
Stand by you
I'll never leave your side…

No matter what may come your way
Call on me I'll be here to stay
Everytime you know what I'll do
I promise I'll stand by you

I'll always be by your side
Smile because you're with me
Whenever you'll call me
I promise I'll be there for you

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you, beside you
I'll stand by you
I promise I'll ѕtаnd by you
