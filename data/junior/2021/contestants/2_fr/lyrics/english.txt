Top from the start at the speed of light
One lightning, one flash and our whole lives are speeding up
Let's stop a little while and I count down from 5, 4, 3 or 2
And we're slowing down time
Faster, much faster than music for grown-ups
If everything is mechanical, we are robots not people anymore
During those moments I fly, I can see the floor getting smaller
My clock is turning so slowly

(Tick, tock, tick) In my heart everything is magical
(Tick, tock, tick) Everybody lives on the fast lane
(Tick, tock, tick) My tempo, my music, it is
(Tock, tick) Sharing happiness

(Tick, tock, tick) Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na
(Tick, tock, tick) Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na
(Tick, tock)
(Tick, tock)
(Tick, tock)
(Tick, tock)

Head in your bubble, you forget your planet is one
Come on let's go out, let's walk so we may all have the same
I want us to a take a break on one of these blue beaches
Feet in the hourglass
Save room for imagination but don't pretend
If there's magic in the air it's inside of you whether you're young or old
That's the way we fly, leaving troubles on the floor
We don't live in the same time zones, but we can live at the same time

(Tick, tock, tick) In my heart everything is magical
(Tick, tock, tick) Everybody lives on the fast lane
(Tick, tock, tick) My tempo, my music, it is
(Tock, tick) Sharing happiness

(Tick, tock, tick) Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na
(Tick, tock, tick) Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na
(Tick, tock)
(Tick, tock)
(Tick, tock)

Oh, if only you knew
I'm so happy since I've been stopping my watch
I do everything I like

(Tick, tock, tick) Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na
(Tick, tock, tick) Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na
(I say tick) Tick, tock, tick (I say tock)
(I say tick, tock) Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na
(I say tick, tock) Tick, tock, tick
(I say tick, tock) Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na
(I say tick, tock) Tick, tock, tick
(I say tick, tock) Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na
(I say tick, tock) Tick, tock, tick
(I say tick, tock) Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na
Tick, tock, tick
Tick, tock, tick
Tick, tock, tick
In your heart everything iѕ magicаl
