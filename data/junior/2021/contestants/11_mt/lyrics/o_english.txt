My Home

We're floating high above the clouds
Past Jupiter, we won't look down
It feels like magic, levitate 'til we fly higher
Don't tell me it's not real just 'cause we're young
We'll make it work, we won't go past the stars

Where do we go if we keep dreaming?
What if our world would change today?
Where do we go?
We're never alone
Maybe if we just keep on believing
Maybe we can live in a fairytale
Where do we go?
When I'm with you it feels like home
When I'm with you it feels like home

They say, "Home is where the heart is, " but you stole mine
When you came in my life it's like I found me a goldmine
You can look me in my eyes when you hold my hand
But you won't understand
I got feelings that I ain't never really felt in my life
So I started giving hints tryna show ya
That I know you want are the perfect one, oh ya
I'm the one for you, so we can do this right
So come one step closer, let me hold ya

Where do we go if we keep dreaming? (Where do we go now?)
What if our world would change today? (Yeah)
Where do we go?
We're never alone
Maybe if we just keep on believing (keep on believing)
Maybe we could live in a fairytale
Where do we go?
I will never let you be alone
We're never alone
(Where do we go if we keep dreaming?)
(What if our world would change today?)
Yeah, I'm always beside you
Where do we go? (Where do we go now?)
'Cause you feel like home
(Maybe if we just keep on believing)
(Maybe we can live in a fairytale)
I will never let you be alone
Where do we go, 'cause when I'm with you it feels like

Yeah, when I'm with you it always feels like home
Ain't nothing to hide now the cover is blown
Now it's all out, and I've seen enough
To know what I'm looking at is but a seed of love
I see faith and I see our future in your eyeѕ
Never alone
You аre my home
