Leverage

I'm looking every day
Among hundreds of reflections
Other people's songs
Words of bitter, false impressions
Where am I, where am I, where am I
Where I am real
Where is my, where is my
Where is my lever
That will turn on the world

We are only given a moment
When the world burns down
And there will be no trace of us
All we can do
Is go out of darkness
And live while there is the time

I can't find the words
But I find strength in myself
While they all
Were asking heaven for everything
They do not dare to silence me
They will not be able to burn my wings
Because it doesn't hurt anymore

We are only given a moment
When the world burns down
And there will be no trace of us
All we can do
Is go out of darkness
And live while there is the time

I was walking, hurting my knees
Walking through the rain and the wind of change
Where is my lever? It is in my dreams
They are waiting there, everyone is willing there
And no one will see it anymore
I despair or I cry
I will, I will be blind to trouble
A dream in the heart means…

We are only given a moment
When the world burns down
And there will be no trace of us
All we can do
Is go out of dаrkness
And live while there is the time

To live… live… live… while there iѕ the time
