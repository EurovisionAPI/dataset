Voice of Love

In your heart
Secret worlds are hidden
Do you want now
As in a fairy tale
To fly together with you

To be the wind for a day
To be a phoenix reborn
In the little things
They left a trail
Although only for a moment

Tra la la la la la love is my voice
Tra la la la la la love is my voice
Tra la la la la la love is my voice

We are the voice of love
The greatest gift of all
The ones to lift you up
The ones that are enough
The wind to carry away your pain

Tra la la la la la love is my voice
Love is my voice

The ones to lift you up
The ones that are enough
The wind to carry away your pain

A song in your dream
With the voice of a dream
In magical words
Love sings

Tra la la la la la love is my voice
Love is my voice

The ones to lift you up
The ones that are enough
The wind to carry away your pain
We are the voice of love
The greatest gift of all

We аre the voice of love (Love is my voice)
Love iѕ my voice
