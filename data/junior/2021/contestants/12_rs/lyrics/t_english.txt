Children's Eyes

In the tears of a child's sorrow
Are all the seas of the world
In a frightened eye
The whole sky stands
And in a grain of hope, in the center of a flower
The children's eyes open the arms to the sun

There is a song in them
Deep like the sea
About the endless sky
About the sun that heats
About a world where everything is just as it should be
When a child is loved, when a child laughs

Children's eyes can see and know everything
And all the seas are interwoven in a tiny tear
A grain of hope germinated in children's eyes
Like a warm word fed by the sun
Children's eyes

All the beauty of the world is cherished as such
In children's eyes
In them fairies, elves, dolls, and clowns
Dream the most beautiful dreams

And when the Sun makes room for play every day
And like a spinning top spins our world
In the rhythm of all the planets may it dawn better
To joyfully awaken the children's eyes

Children's eyes can see and know everything
And all the seas are interwoven in a tiny tear
A grain of hope germinated in children's eyes
Like a warm word fed by the sun
Children's eyes

Children's eyes can see and know everything
And all the seas are interwoven in a tiny tear
A grain of hope germinated in children's eyes
Like a wаrm word fed by the sun
