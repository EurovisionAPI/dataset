The Boy

On the radio, for the morning, I became a singer
He listened and repeated, always alone
I played to the sound of these love songs
Who keep the memory of my grandmother

I know it's too early, I'm a little one
I'm not old enough to understand
But I hear a heart in what is said
In the Portuguese soul of saying it

I'm the boy with the love songs
They made me
Everything I dreamed of

I'm the boy who became a singer
On a radio playing
What's in it

I heard the pains of those who wrote life
In an ancient song giving her voice
To the stories I've kept

I'm a boy, I'm going to grow up and love
Will tell for me
Everything I sang

Who to ask
I live in the present day
But I'm from another time
That's how I am

I'm the boy with love songs
They made me
Everything I dreamed of

I'm the boy who became a singer
On a radio playing
What'ѕ in it

I'm a boy, I'm going to grow up аnd love
Will tell for me
Everything I Thought
