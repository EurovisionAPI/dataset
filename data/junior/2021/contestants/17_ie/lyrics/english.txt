Free

Stop the hands on the clock
My life, my life got very small (My life got very small)
Listen to the clock (Listen to the clock)
For more than a year time stood still
Without friends or school or anywhere to go (Anywhere to go)
Anywhere to go (Anywhere to go)

Stand with me, don't care about rules, this is life
We're not sitting down
The teachers, Zoom TV, here, here
Dancing on the table

I don't care what you think about me now
I hear my friend breaking out of the norm again
Here, it's true, in our hearts we are free
Listen to me and stand with the young people
Stay with me for the night full of fun again
Here, still free, you can't make us disappear
You can't make us disappear

Now I'm here, like this, like that
Arriving on the land here, I hear, "Oo la la" (I hear, "Oo la la")
I hear, "Oo la la"
Are you my love? My lovely girl?
With me in Paris, will you come back? (Will you come back?)
Will you come back? (Will you come back?)

Stand with me, don't care about rules, this is life
We're not sitting down
The teachers, Zoom TV, here, here
Dancing on the table

I don't care what you think about me now
I hear my friend breaking out of the norm again
Here, it's true, in our hearts we are free
Listen to me and stand with the young people
Stay with me for the night full of fun again
Here, still free, you can't make us disappear
You can't make us disappear

(Free, my dear)
(Free, my dear)
(And listen)
Stand with me, don't care about rules, this is life
(Be free my dears)
We're not sitting down
The teachers, Zoom TV, here, here
Dancing on the table

I don't care what you think about me now
I hear my friend breaking out of the norm again
Here, still free, you can't make us disappear
Listen to me and stand with the young people
Stay with me for the night full of fun again
Here, still free, you can't make us disappear
You can't make us diѕappeаr
