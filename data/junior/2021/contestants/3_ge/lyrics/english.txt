Let's Count the Smiles

La la la
This day taught me a smile
I make you someone else
Let's give the heavens a lot today
Fairy of Love

If you believe me, I believe you
Come on, you're dreaming and I believe you
If you believe me, I believe you

La la la - this day taught me a smile
And you probably
Recognize a friend's smile and smiley eyes
Count Count Count Count
I counted beautiful smiles
Try It Too
Follow the Repeat
You start repeating me too

If you believe me, I believe you
Come on, you're dreaming and I believe you
If you believe me, I believe you
I sing with you
Day is wonderful

So who will sing if we don't
When to try today or not
Win Time Don't Waste Time
Ou Ou Ou Ou
Sing with me if you feel a bit down
When you smile, we love, you be just the way you are
Show me all the dance moves, maybe some crazy moves
Tonight we are celebrating every good thing with you

Ow Ow because Ou
Ow Ow because Ou
Ow Ow because Ou
Smile Owu Owu

If you believe me, I believe you
Come on, you're dreaming and I believe you
If you believe me, I believe you
I sing with you
Day is wonderful
