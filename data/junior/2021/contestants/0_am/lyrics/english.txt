Wind Wind

I go high and
There's a place where I feel safe and free
The city shines
The city shines differently

I went higher and higher, higher than the skies
I found myself, way far away

The wind, the wind will take me again
To the wilds far away
Higher and higher I'll go
I'll be invisible, like you, wind

We're high in the skies and no one can see us
The wind is with me and I'm not afraid
That it will leave me, that it will disappear
It holds me in its arms

I went higher and higher, higher than the skies
I found myself, way far away

The wind, the wind will take me again
To the wilds far away
Higher and higher I'll go
I'll be invisible, like you, wind

Ha… wind wind
Ha… wind wind

I know you can feel it, the wind inside
The same thing in my heart that makes me feel alive
Whenever you feel it, don't you think of falling down again

The wind, the wind will take me again
To the wilds far away
Higher аnd higher I'll go
I'll be inviѕible, like you, wind
