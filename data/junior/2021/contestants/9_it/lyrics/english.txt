Mirror On The Wall

It lies, the mirror lies, dirty, broken, deceitful lens
It cuts trough, the mirror offends, it draws curtains in front of the eyes
It descends, the mirror descends behind thoughts, under the skin
It laughs, the mirror laughs of my affections, of my setbacks
It laughs, the mirror laughs of my flaws, of my complexes
Coils, among its coils my uncertainties fall deeply

I am here without any filter and without any deception
I am like this beyond the veil of my glances, there is a universe in me
I am here, here in front of you

Mirror, mirror of my desires love me, hug me, accept me
Mirror, mirror of my fairy tale, appraise me, respect me
Mirror, mirror of my shortcomings, tell me the truth

I am here without any filter and without any deception
I am like this beyond the wall of my glances
Look for the reflex inside me and you will never lie me again
I am here, here in front of you

Masks off from the eyes, off from the soul
My heart, my essence will treasure
I just want to be the real me, everyday and you will be
And you will be a memory

I am here without any filter and without any deception
I am like this beyond the veil of my glances
Look for the reflex inѕide me and you will never lie to me again
I аm here, here in front of you
