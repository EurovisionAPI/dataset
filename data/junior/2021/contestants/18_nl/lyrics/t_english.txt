See You Soon

If only I could today
Back and forth around the world
And we'd be together
'Cause I miss
Every moment I'm there
A lot of what I know
We are miles apart
I miss you every single day

Wish I could fly away
My kite takes me with him
Quickly I'll follow my way to you
Hope to see you soon
See you soon

If you too
Looking up at the same time
And there seems to be less distance
I feel you very close
I miss you every single day

Wish I could fly away
My kite takes me with him
Quickly I'll follow my way to you
Hope to see you soon

In my dreams I can float
With my kite through the air
Towards the cherry blossom
I want to experience everything there
With my paper kite
Takes me there and then back here

Wish I could fly away
Waiting for that day
Wish I could fly away
My kite takes me with him
Quickly I'll follow my way to you
Hope to see you soon
You are so far away
I miss you every day
Soon I'll follow my way to you
Hope to see you soon

See you soon
When I ѕee you agаin
