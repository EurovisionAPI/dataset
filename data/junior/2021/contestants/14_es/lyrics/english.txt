Smile

Come, let's go to that place
Where a new sun is born
And our dreams light up

See, our voices will come together
Our hands will forge
Crystalline a new world
Hey! You

Don't be afraid anymore
If it still hurts inside
Everything happens and will pass
Let's go
Take my hand
This is the moment
Today

Let's laugh and dance
Until dawn
Come on, today is today
And he doesn't come back

Starting over
It can be achieved
Let it happen
This is the time
And the revolution

Let's go! You and me
It can be reached
If you believe that dreams
They come true
Let's shine
It's time to get started
We're going to shout Hey
This is the revolution

Come on, let's go to that place
Where friendship grows
And Hope is ignited

Hey! You

Don't be afraid anymore
If it still hurts inside
Everything happens and will pass
Let's go
Take my hand
This is the moment
Today

Let's laugh and dance
Until dawn
Come on, today is today
And he doesn't come back
Starting over
It can be achieved
Let's create together
A new world full of colors
A roller coaster of emotions

Open your soul and fly
The heart rises
Open the windows
To a new life
This is the time
Of the Revolution

Let's go! You and me
It can be reached
If you believe that dreams
They come true
Let's shine
It's time to get stаrted
We're going to shout Hey
Thiѕ revolution
