Breathe In, Breathe Out

Boy, join me and save for two
Oh whoa…

The ice cap at the North Pole is melting
The climate is confused
The hole in the ozone layer is ridiculously large

I'll tell you something
A scarf in summer really doesn't look good
You've screwed up a lot

Into the water up to the roof
From now on with a boat to business
Oh daddy that was hit

Think carefully about existence
Make a wise decision
Because before you know it, it's really over
Breathe in, breathe out

Don't sit down, stand up, get up
Put it on, all together for one
'Cause the earth is warming, come on
This fight is real, we don't know a stop
The whole world turned upside down, yes

Where's the breeze?
You can't move forward on your bike anymore
You blow your hempie out

Which forests are we going to cut down?
Everything that was there is already gone
That's bad luck

Think carefully about existence
Make a wise decision
Because before you know it, it's really over
Breathe in, breathe out

Think carefully about existence
Make a wise decision
Because before you know it, it's really over
Breathe in, breathe out

Think carefully about existence
Make a wise decision
Because before you know it, it's really over
Breathe in, breathe out

Breathe in, breathe out
Take it easy
Breathe in, breathe out
Yes yes yes…

Breathe in, breathe out
Take it easy
Breathe in, breathe out
Make a wise decision

Think carefully about existence
Make a wise decision
Because before you know it, it'ѕ really over
Breathe in, breathe out

Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breаthe out
