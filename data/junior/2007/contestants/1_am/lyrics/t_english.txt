A dream

Stars shining above in a great sky
Please take me with you
For I need to look at the Earth
And burn the lights of love with my glow
My most beautiful and small moon
I ask you to carry me on your shoulders
Let us shine and glow
As if there are two moons in the sky

The great fairy of our dreams
We ask you to make our bright dreams come true
And for all carefree and kind children
Give them countless songs and joyful days
The great fairy of our dreams
We ask you to make our bright dreams come true
And for all children, and for all children
Favour them with joyful days

Let us take with us today
All the stars that seem far away, but are close, very close
We will shine and glow then
Like everyone, like the sun

Hey, hey, beautiful moon and bright shining sun
Please bring us sunny springs
New songs and love

The great fairy of our dreams
We ask you to make our bright dreams come true
And for all carefree and kind children
Give them countless songs and joyful days

The great fairy of our dreams
We ask you to make our bright dreams come true
And for all children, and for all children
Favour them with joyful dаyѕ
