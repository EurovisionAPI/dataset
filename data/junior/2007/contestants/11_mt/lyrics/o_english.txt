Music

We love to dance, we love to sing
Music gets me going, makes my heart complete

Music varies to each mood
It enhances your good thoughts
Understands the blue times too

For each moment you go through
There's a tune that's made for you

Come and join me in our song
Let your friends come tag along
With each note sing your heart out
And with each beat let your feet dance

Come and join me in our song
Let your friends come tag along
With each note sing your heart out
And with each beat let your feet dance

Music's fine, it's divine
Hear us sing, watch us sway

It's a way to say you're glad
Even tell them that you're sad
Music's there to help you grow

For each moment you go through
There's a tune that's made for you

Come and join me in our song
Let your friends come tag along
With each note sing your heart out
And with each beat let your feet dance

Come and join me in our song
Let your friends come tag along
With each note sing your heart out
And with each beat let your feet dance

Music's fine, it's divine
Let the beat control you, let it blow you away
Hear us sing, watch us sway, join our band
Let it set you free, free, free…

Come and join me in our song
Let your friends come tag along
With each note sing your heart out
And with each beat let your feet dance

Come and join me in our song
Let your friends come tag along
With each note sing your heart out
And with each beat let your feet dance

We love to dance, we love to sing
Music gets me going, makeѕ my heаrt comple-e-ete…
