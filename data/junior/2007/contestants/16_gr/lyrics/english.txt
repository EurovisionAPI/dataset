Somewhere I was confused

Yes yes… I fell in love
Yes yes… Somewhere I was confused
Yes yes… In the dream I got involved

Don't play me the bully
I don't get caught up in these tricks
I have learned what you are asking for
One day you want me and then you forget me

Yes yes… go crazy
Yes yes… you went astray
Yes yes… hey you stumbled

Don't play me the bully
I don't get caught up in these tricks
I have learned what you are asking for
One day you want me and then you forget me

Do, do, somersault if you want
Make laughter and joy
Do it if you want
And figures on the slopes
But…

Don't play me the bully
I don't get caught up in these tricks
I have learned what you are asking for
One day you want me and then you forget me

Don't play me the bully
I don't get caught up in these tricks
I have learned what you are asking for
One day you want me and then you forget me

Bye bye… you аre overcome
Bye bye… You pressed the limitѕ
Bye bye… go forgotten

Bye bye
Bye bye
Bye bye
