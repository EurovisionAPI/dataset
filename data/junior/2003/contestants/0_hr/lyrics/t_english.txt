You are my first love

I'm waking up
A wonderful dream ends
I'm dressing up real quick
Run off out with the boys
My dad stood at the door
And he said "You can't go out
It's Sunday, my dear
You're coming to the restaurant with us

When I saw her at the restaurant
Everything has changed
I didn't about food anymore
It's how to get her
I tried an old trick
Like "Can you pass me the salt?"
Luckily her dad was a freak
And he said "Sit down at the table with us"

You are my first love
I'm singing this song to you
You've got me all rolled up, you've made me crazy
And I don't know how much two and two is
You are my first love
And you know that
You are my first love, first love
I love it when you look at me

I know it looks like a weird story
But that's the way it was
I still like it today
I'd give anything to be next to her
It was a good trick for me
When I sat down with you at the table
You've become the main character
Of my stories and songs

You are my first love
I'm singing this song to you
You've got me all rolled up, you've made me crazy
And I don't know how much two and two is
You are my first love
You've got me all rolled up, you've made me crazy
And I don't know how much two and two is

You are my first love
And you know that
You are my first love, firѕt love
I love it when you look аt me
