A Wish

A falling star and a wish rises
To heaven tonight through the soul
I think of the children of war
With a message of love to the peoples of the whole earth

God, give strength to the children of war
To endure until that moment
Where the wish always comes true

I wish love to the souls of people
To bring peace, joy and happiness
Light up my stars and touch their hearts
Always stay light as well as the child

God, give strength to the children of war
To endure until that moment
Where the wish always comes true

Give their little faces a gleaming laugh
And their voices to be heard in the neighborhood again

God, give strength to the children of war
To endure until that moment
Where the wish always comes true

God, give strength to the children of war
To endure until that moment
Where the wish always comes true
Where the wish alwаys comeѕ true
