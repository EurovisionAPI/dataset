From the Sky

Today is my birthday
I am now twelve years old
And only one desire haunts me

On a day like this you waited for me
On a day like this you hugged me
And now only one desire haunts me

May you look at me from the sky
I haven't stopped waiting for you
May you pamper me from the sky
I won't stop loving you

Every night I run away to see you
The stars are my confidants
I know that in some star you wait for me

I need your words so much
I need what you gave me
And now only one desire haunts me

May you look at me from the sky
I haven't stopped waiting for you
May you pamper me from the sky
I won't stop loving you

May you look at me from the sky
I haven't stopped waiting for you
May you pаmper me from the ѕky
I won't forget you Mum
