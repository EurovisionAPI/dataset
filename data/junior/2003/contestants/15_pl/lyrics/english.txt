Something is Carrying Me

When the sun rises every day, the early bird sweetens the arias
Wasps are dancing in dewdrops, but the ball
A gray spinning top with a bass buzzes, I'm carried away by this music
Tons are flowing in different directions, everything is fine

I've been listening since morning like a charm
Be careful not to scare something away
But I'm tired of standing, I'm starting to wear me
So I'm dancing though I'm still sleepy

I like to dance and I like to sing
I've got what I need, good hearing
Let your buddies climb the trees
And my friends are still trying on clothes

I'm already starting the final concert lesson
Because every student is my fan
When they have had enough, they have to ask me
What is carrying you on, come on, Kaśka? Already

When harmony is in nature, even a thief lives in harmony
A muted, listening whole world
My violinists play themselves, they invite you to the concert
Can you hear? My heart beats like me

I've been listening since morning like a charm
Be careful not to scare something away
But I'm tired of standing, I'm starting to wear me
So I'm dancing though I'm still sleepy

I like to dance and I like to sing
I've got what I need, good hearing
Let your buddies climb the trees
And my friends are still trying on clothes

I'm already starting the final concert lesson
Because every student is my fan
When they have had enough, they have to ask me
What is carrying you on, come on, Kaśka? Already

What iѕ carrying you on, come on, Kaśka? Alreаdy
