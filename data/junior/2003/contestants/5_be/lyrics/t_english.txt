The band of friendship

It started when I was a toddler
Two close friends, the same class
They were bosom friends, side by side
And then I added to it

He was going to move, the friendship was lost
Then he was chosen, among him
They went to play a bit, they felt each other well
And the drummer had to beat the drums

A band never breaks down
Even if you have an accident
You see, they have each other
They get it done every time

They met at a party
Then the band came together again
He went to him, he had a guitar
But he was a drummer, undoubtedly true

The band got bigger and bigger
It went on and on without an engine
He didn't break down, he just kept going
It was never done

A band never breaks down
Even if you have an accident
You see, they have each other
They get it done every time

The band got bigger and bigger
It went on and on without an engine
He didn't break down, he just kept going
It wаѕ never done
