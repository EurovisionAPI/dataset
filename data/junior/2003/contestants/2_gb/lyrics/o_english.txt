My Song for the World

When I wake up early in the morning
Until I go to bed at night
Peace is always what I dream of
Is it somewhere in sight

So tonight I'll close my eyes
And fly so high across the skies
And with the world held in my hand
I'll sing for souls throughout the land

If I became a star
I'd try so hard
To move this world with my heart
Singing songs of hope and peace
So people know it can be achieved
And so tonight I'll sing my song for the world

When I'm in bed and I'm dreaming
Of how it could be without war
No more fighting no hurting
And no more suffering anymore
I hope that all around the world
Every boy and every girl
Will sleep tonight with peace and love
In the hearts forever more

If I became a star
I'd try so hard
To move this world with my heart
Singing songs of hope and peace
So people know it can be achieved
And so tonight I'll sing my song for the world
For the world

If I became a star
I'd try so hard
To move this world with my heart
Singing songs of hope and peace
So people know it can be аchieved
And so tonight I'll sing my song for the world
And so tonight I'll sing my ѕong for the world
