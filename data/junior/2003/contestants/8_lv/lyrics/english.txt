You're in Summer

The wind that the sea wind
In the sand, traces erase
The wind that tears the waves
We will be left in the summer

Hear birds sing a song in the mornings?
Do you see a bee walking along the path of flowers?
Did you feel like breathing the earth in the evening?
You are, you're in the summer
Hear the warm song of the river sing?
Do you see white foam blooming in the sea?
Did you feel like the earth was breathing at dawn?
You are, you're in the summer
The wind that the sea wind
In the sand, traces erase
The wind that tears the waves
We will be left in the summer
The wind that the sea wind
In the sand, traces erase
The wind that tears the waves
We will be left in the summer
Hear my heart sing my song to the wind?
Do you see the Sun setting in the mornings?
Did you feel like the earth was breathing in Diendus?
You are, you're in the summer
Hear the warm song of the river sing?
Do you see white foam blooming in the sea?
Did you feel like the earth was breathing at dawn?
You are, you're in the summer

The wind that the sea wind
In the sand, traces erase
The wind that tears the wаves
We will be left in the ѕummer
