Like a Star

Like a star together we'll shine
Together we'll fly and further we'll glide
Like a star together we'll pass through
Together we'll sail through those difficult times

Like a star that shoots from up high
And lights up the sky, just cannot deny
Like a star we'll jump from the cloud
And sing out aloud, together we'll shine

Up in the sky there's a star that comes out at night
Deep in my mind there's a thought that gives it some light
We can all together make it shine so bright, made up my mind
So come on together, we'll make it and leave the past behind

Like a star together we'll shine
Together we'll fly and further we'll glide
Like a star together we'll pass through
Together we'll sail through those difficult times

It's fun when I play hide and seek with the moon up above
Singing with angels in heaven sweet songs of love
Don't worry when clouds give me shelter and you don't see me shine so bright
'Cause I'll never leave you alone, I will be your guiding light

Like a star together we'll shine
Together we'll fly and further we'll glide
Like a star together we'll pass through
Together we'll sail through…, those difficult times

If you can't make it on your own
Give me your hand and we'll be strong
We can't go wrong

Like a star together we'll shine
Together we'll fly and further we'll glide
Like a star together we'll pass through
Together we'll sail through those difficult times

Like a star that shoots from up high
And lights up the sky, just cannot deny
Like a star we'll jump from the cloud
And sing out aloud, together we'll shine

Like a stаr
Together we'll ѕhine
