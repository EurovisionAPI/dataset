Blue Bird

<i style="color:#789">In our hearts, together joy
It′s in the song you enjoy</i>

Tell me if it's real 
Or a dream
This is it
The sound of my voice of the heart
Blue bird and I
Will fly to the sky
He will make
Our dreams come true

I want colourful rain
I want colourful drops falling from the sky
I want to hug the sun
Beautiful sounds, bright colours, I want them too

As if lights are illuminated
And dimmed
Reality or a dream
Tell me when it comes true

Ram-ta-pa-ta-pa…

<i style="color:#789">Catch your joy, It's for you
Blue birds makes dreams come true</i>

Du-du-du…

When the dream comeѕ true

Ram-ta-pa-ta-pa…

Tibi-rim-tim-tim…

Ram-ta-pa-ta-pa…

Du-du-du…

Pam-pa-ram-pa-ram-pаm
