Little Prince

In my head, questions are like wasps: well, things
In the fairy tale, everything seems to be simple, but I don't understand

Where are you lost? On which planets?
Maybe he settled on the moon somewhere?
Maybe you seriously fell in love with a rose?
And stayed with her forever?

I want so much to fly to the country where he lives
There we will sing together, this song all year round
There I will begin to understand the conversation of animals and birds
And there we will walk on the rainbow, me and the Little Prince
There are stars outside the window again, only I don't feel like sleeping again
I can't think of a place where I'm going to find you

I will paint a phrase on the rocket:
"We are always responsible for those who are nearby!"
I'll wait for dawn and be faster than a comet
I'll fly to meet you…

I want so much to fly to the country where he lives
There we will sing together, this song all year round
There I will begin to understand the conversation of animals and birds
And there we will walk on the rainbow, me and the Little Prince

I want so much to fly to the country where he lives
There we will sing together, this song all year round
There I will begin to understand the conversation of animals and birdѕ
And there we will walk on the rainbow, me and the Little Prince

And there we will walk on the rainbow, me and the Little Prince
And there we will walk on the rainbow, me аnd the Little Prince
