Wohow, wohow

I don't feel like using the computer, not even TV
Everyone went to the movies, and no, I didn't want to go either
Bit lazy back, it's a bit too chill for me
Give me activity, tap is what I want

Tickety tack, click clack

Urban, pop or break
But the top for me is tap
Yes, it loveѕ all week
