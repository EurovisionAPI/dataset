For Love

You're looking at me
With Your Eyes
How clear oceans smolder
You smile again
With a white smile
Ah, it's playing in my heart
Heavenly music
Oh…

Let the whole world hear
Now I'm singing about love
I remember being like a bird in flight
Dreaming of Love
Let the whole world know
Now I'm crying for love
Sweet tears, not a sin
Dreaming of Love

You're doing it your own way
And I know, you notice
I react passionately to you
The soul trembles
Is it futile?
But it'ѕ not that important
I feel great

Give me your hand
Sincerely and from the heart
Sing for Love
Let the whole world hear
Hug me hard
Enjoy аnd feel
Sing for Love
