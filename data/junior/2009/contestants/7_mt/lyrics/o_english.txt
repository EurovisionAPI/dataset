Double Trouble

When you meet the twin of me
Such a pair you'll never see
She is not a shining star
Just a little bit bizarre

Just go pick on someone your own kind
Stop being a coward and unwind
It's hard, I know, we're so unlike
Let us make up and compromise

Double trouble, twice the muddle
Double trouble, twofold huddle
Double trouble, dual struggle
We can get you in a fuddle
Double trouble, muddy puddles
Double trouble, soapy bubbles
Double trouble, noisy babbles
In the end we're best of friends
Friends, friends

Why is it, how do I do
To understand this fussy fool
What? Lend a hand, give me a clue
Just to change her absurd mood

Shut up, and listen well for once
You're just play-acting out the dunce
You know I love you dear in tons
Let us give out a huge surprise

Double trouble, twice the muddle
Double trouble, twofold huddle
Double trouble, dual struggle
We can get you in a fuddle

Double trouble, muddy puddles
Double trouble, soapy bubbles
Double trouble, noisy babbles
In the end we're best of friends

We are, we are best of friends
We are, we are best of friends
We are best of friends

Double trouble, twice the muddle
Double trouble, twofold huddle
Double trouble, dual struggle
We can get you in a fuddle

Double trouble, muddy puddles
Double trouble, soapy bubbles
Double trouble, noisy babbles
In the end we're best of friends, friends

We are, we are best of friends
We are, we аre best of friendѕ
