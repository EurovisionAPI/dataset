You have the Power in your Hand

You should smile
And don't forget how you live
You don't have too many cards in play
Find a place today
Everyone has a dream
The future is not written
And it's up to us
Whatever it is, don't back down

You have the power in your hand…
Today it's time to change something
You have the power in your hand…
Be careful what you do with it
You can also move mountains, yes…

The world is a beautiful place
When we give it a meaning
Let yourѕelf be carried awаy by the wind
But with my feet on the ground
