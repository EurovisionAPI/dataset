The Right One

One beautiful afternoon
In a park full of greenery
I've seen a beautiful boy
And she immediately fell in love

It's a magical feeling
When you're flying above the clouds
And I understood and I know very well
Yes, I love him madly

The legs walked on their own
They brought me to him
He didn't tell me anything
He just took me by the hand
It's like Juliet and Romeo

It's a magical feeling
When you're flying above the clouds
And I understood and I know very well
Yes, I love him madly

How do you know, how do you know what it feels like?
How do you know, how do you know it's not a dream?
If you know he's always in your head
Then you know it's the right one

It's a magical feeling
When you're flying above the clouds
And I understood and I know very well
Yeѕ, I love him mаdly
