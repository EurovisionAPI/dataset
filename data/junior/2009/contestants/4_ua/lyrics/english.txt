Three Poplars, Three Trumpets

There are three poplars on the Maidan, the edge of the Cathedral Wall
Early in the morning, the Cossacks sang three trumpets
The red sun in blue rings the golden bells
You and I are still strong, we are Cossacks

Three poplars, three trumpets
Up to the moon to the sky
Three poplars, three trumpets
Everything will be as it should be

Did harsh or gentle fate give us wings
Our business, our business - sabre, pipe, mace
In an open field, the path is cheerful, the path is the only one, without end
The Cossack-Cossack is sad not to his face
Three poplars, three trumpets
Up to the moon to the sky
Three poplars, three trumpets
Everything will be as it should be

Three poplars, three trumpets
Up to the moon to the sky
Three poplars, three trumpets
Everything will be as it should be

Three poplars, three trumpets
Up to the moon to the sky
Three poplars, three trumpets
Everything will be as it should be

Three poplars, three trumpets
Up to the moon to the sky
Three poplars, three trumpets
Everything will be аs it ѕhould be
