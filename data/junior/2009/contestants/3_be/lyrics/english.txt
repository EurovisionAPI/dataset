So in Love (Yodelo)

I've met a boy
He's at my school
Very handsome, he looks like an idol
And yet it's super cool
In football, a real pro
Every girl's heart is lost

But I'm in love
So in love

I look deep into his eyes and see a thousand rainbows
And I feel that way
Yodeley yodeley yodelo
I want to dance, I want to jump, 'cause he makes my heart sing
And then it goes like this
Yodeley yodeley yodelo

He's my best buddy
My friend, my anchor
Did you ever see a better picture than the two of us?
I look deep into his eyes and see a thousand rainbows
And I feel that way
Yodeley yodeley yodelo

I want to spoil him with notes every day
'Til I get to kiss him, la-la-la-la
And when he smiles at me
I'll never get used to it
And then I feel like this
Yodeley yodeley yodeley yodeley yodeley yodeley yodeley yodeley yodeley yode

I look deep into his eyes and see a thousand rainbows
And I feel that way
Yodeley yodeley yodelo
I want to dance, I want to jump, 'cause he makes my heart sing
And then it goes like this
Yodeley yodeley yodelo

He's my best buddy
My friend, my anchor
Did you ever see a better picture than the two of us?
I look deep into his eyes and see a thousand rainbowѕ
And I feel that wаy
Yodeley yodeley yodelo

Yodeley yodeley yodelo
