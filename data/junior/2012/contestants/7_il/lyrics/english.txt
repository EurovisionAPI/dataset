Let the Music Win

If you speak a foreign language
I don't understand it
So maybe when you try with music
Silence disappears

And so you and I can
We will talk easily
This is it, when you try with music

And will love us
The whole world is in our hands
And we can break the ice
So the winning song will come

Let the music win it all
Win it all
The music will win everything
The music will win

Loud music
Choose it, you can
So let the music win it all

If you are trying to reach me
With talk
Gap between us remains

So there will be love between us
The whole world is in our hands
And we can break the ice
So the winning song will come

Let the music win it all
Win it all
The music will win everything
The music will win

Loud music
Choose it, you can
So let the music win it all

And we can break the ice
So the winning song will come

Let the music win it all
Win it all
The music will win everything
The music will win

Loud music
Choose it, you can
So let the muѕic win it аll
