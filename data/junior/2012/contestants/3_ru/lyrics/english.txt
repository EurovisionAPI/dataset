Sensational

We are at different poles of the Earth
Eye to eye
Something important has been found with you
We cannot be separated

And only love saves the world

You and I are just a sensation
Like charges over wires
The two of us and we will not part
Me and you, you and me – always

You and I are just a sensation
Feelings as pure as water
The two of us, we're so happy
Me and you, you and me, we are a sensation

I'm looking for a route on a globe
The way from you to me
Together we will overcome the path
We are on the same wavelength

And only love saves the world

You and I are just a sensation
Like charges over wires
The two of us and we will not part
Me and you, you and me – always

You and I are just a sensation
Feelings as pure as water
The two of us, we're so happy
Me and you, you and me, we are a sensation

I know this love keeps us alive

You and I – we are sensational
We're creating the history
Hear my voice on every station now
'Cause this song is for you and me

You and I – we are sensational
This is how it's just meant to be
You and I – we're so happy now
Can't you see, you and me – we're senѕationаl
