The Sky

The sky, open our eyes, give us the strength to go on
I feel with my heart our light, a wave of flames
The sky, open our eyes, give us the strength to go on
I feel with my heart our light, a wave of flames

Thousands of people, Have saved the day
I'm shining in the quiet sky, with the light of my eyes
Tears to the non-being, I understand
That I can be strong, because The Earth is calling for us

The sky, open our eyes, give us the strength to go on
I feel with my heart our light, a wave of flames
The sky, open our eyes, give us the strength to go on
I feel with my heart our light, a wave of flames

Fire in the sky shining through the night
You'll never make me surrender, you see it in my eyes
Fire in the sky shining through the night
You'll never mаke me surrender, you see it in my eyeѕ
