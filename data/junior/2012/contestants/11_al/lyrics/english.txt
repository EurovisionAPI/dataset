I have a song just for you

I have a song that I love very much
I have a song I love
The song is twin to me
I don't change it with another

The song awakens a thousand dreams
I am with friends and friends
There is no such thing as my song
I will sing it at the festival

You don't know how much I love you
You don't know who I am
Sing along with me
Junior at the festival

The song only gives us joy
The song brings the children together
It's your song or my song
It doeѕn't mаtter if you win
