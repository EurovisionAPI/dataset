Wings

You will be brave
Open the windows
Collect all forces in the fist

But in the silent your voice is
Barely heard
Barely heard

Just say once -
"I'm not afraid"
Doing the first step

And repeat with echo
These words
These words

And in the one
Suddenly interflow one hundred rivers
You will be never
Alone anymore here

I'll spread my wings
Behind your back
The sky will get closer
If you're with me
Wings
You won't lose
Higher than the sun
Follow me

We all are just the humans
But if we want
Heaven can be so close

There're no bounds and limits
Somewhere so high
You can get what you want

That's the time
Destiny unites our roads
We are one
You will never be alone

Higher than the starlight
Where the birds can't fly
We are floating angels
Reaching up the sky
Starlight, it's so hard to breathe
We are, we are finders
Of all the world had missed

Starlight
It's so hard to breathe
We are, we are finders
Of all the world had missed

Higher
I spread my wings
Behind your back
The sky will get closer if you're with me
Wings
You won't lose
Higher than the sun
Follow me
Higher than the sun
Follow me
Higher thаn the ѕun
Follow me
