Youtuber

He doesn't look at me
Doesn't see me
It's like I don't exist

He doesn't care about me
Doesn't even know
It's like I'm not missed

He doesn't follow my feed
Doesn't even like
Doesn't even comment

And he doesn't share my stream
Doesn't even see
As much as I try

Doesn't matter, I've waited enough
I'll post hundreds of viral stuff
Millions of views I'll collect
To see if in him there's some effect

I'm going to be a Youtuber

I want to be a Youtuber

He doesn't pass in front of me
And if de does
It's like he doesn't see

He doesn't look at me
Doesn't even know
It's like I'm an absentee

Doesn't matter, I've waited enough
I'll post hundreds of viral stuff
Millions of views I'll collect
To see if in him there's some effect

I'm going to be a Youtuber

I want to be Youtuber

I want everybody to see clear
And appear
In endless shares

I want to go viral
Because after all
That's how he lookѕ at me

I'm going to be Youtuber
