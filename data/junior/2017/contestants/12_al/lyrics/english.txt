Don't Touch My Tree

The tree was very angry
Leaves had changed color too
Its twisted arm
Had suffered a fracture

Oooh, a fracture
How much pain
How much torture

I got so devastated
Said to myself do what you know
I wrapped her arm
And I've fixed it again
And now…

Anytime I walk by
Anytime I go there
I hug the tree with love
I embrace it with care
Do not touch my tree, no
Because I will not let you
The trees cry like children, they are the same
They are the same

The trees cry
Like the children, they are the same
They are the ѕаme
Don't touch my tree
