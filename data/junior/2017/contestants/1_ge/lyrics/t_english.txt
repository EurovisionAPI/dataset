Voice of the Heart

If you listen now
Yours Song
If you see high
A Sky Full of Light
It's like a fairy tale
And you're just today
You are the hero of this world's fairy tale book
That's why follow your heart

With an infinite sense
Earth Care
Now the time has come
Lalala Lalala
Listen to the voice that he
Heat requires
Because in you breathes the world
Oh, this song is like the sound of your heart
Follow this voice

If today just one
Plant and take care of the tree
Giving him life and you
If you feel the height of the mountains
You realize that you have wings and you reach the sun
Don't lose this silhouette

With an infinite sense
Earth Care
Now the time has come
Lalala Lalala
Listen to the voice that he
Heat requires
And everyone calls us

Today the earth looks like a small child
And love to feel
Our House of Sevens
Our beautiful planet
We will tell him that, we will warm up, we will warm up…

With an infinite sense
Earth Care
Now the time has come
Lalala Lalala

Listen to the voice that he
Heat requires
And everyone calls us
And call us all…
And call us all…

With an infinite sense
Listen to his voice
The earth lookѕ like а little child…
