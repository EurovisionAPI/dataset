Speak Up

Speak up, I will
Speak up, I will
Speak up, I will
(I need you to know)

Speak up, I will
Speak up, I will
(Speak up, I will)
(I'm coming back for more)

I've always known I'm a girl
That can never stay quiet
I can be soft as a song
Can be strong as a lion

When I hear 'em tell us to take it
We just stand united
'Cause I can speak up
Yeah I can speak up

Don't blame it on my youth
I'm gonna speak the truth
Tell you, tell you what's inside me
What defines me

Could lay in bed all day
Still stuck in yesterday
No way, no way
Come stand beside me

Speak up, I'm gonna say it
Now speed up, I'm coming back for more
(I'm coming back for more)
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up now

Speak up, I'm gonna say it
Don't need much, I just need you to know
(I need you to know)
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up now

Stay true to me, 'cause I know
What it's like when I hide it
Oh wait, I'mma make my mistakes
But just let me decide them

Oh yeah, give me your worst
And I know I'll survive it
'Cause I'mma speak up
Yeah I'mma speak up

Don't blame it on my youth
I'm gonna speak the truth
Tell you, tell you what's inside me
What defines me

Could lay in bed all day
Still stuck in yesterday
No way, no way
Come stand beside me

Speak up, I'm gonna say it
Now speed up, I'm coming back for more
(I'm coming back for more)
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up now

Speak up, I'm gonna say it
Don't need much, I just need you to know
(I need you to know)
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up now

Speak up, I will
Speak up, I will
Speak up, I will
Woah-uh-ohh…

Speak up, I'm gonna say it
Now speed up, I'm coming back for more
(I'm coming back for more)
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up now

Don't need much, I just need you to know

Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up now
