My Home

The sun is rising through the clouds
The light is landing on my face
A moment of silence becalming dust
And the world is dancing in colours of the grace

So I believe in this coming day

By the force of our hearts
We can build something for us
Before losing correct ways
We should rise our heads
Let's make together (just) one small step
The aim is still within reach
(We) can't stand fails, not any more

This is my home

I don't want to drown in the sea of words
Looking for any sense of them
I have a longing for good and hope
Given to me in the hands of a brand new day

So I believe in this better dream

By the force of our hearts
We can build something for us
Before losing correct ways
We should rise our heads
Let's make together just one small step
The aim is still within reach
We can't stand fails, not any more

It's my home

I want to believe in thiѕ new, better dаy
