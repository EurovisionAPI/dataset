Dancing Through Life

There's place for everyone under the sky
Love knows that best
A big heart has no boundaries
In front of us is the Universe and great wishes
To love is a very beautiful thing
And make someone be endlesslly happy
Life is a dance with the planets
Live now, this is our time

Now this is our space
And this is our time
Living through dance
We're dancing through life
Dancing through life
In space and time
We're flying again
A life through dance
Is our sign
Dancing through life

Oooo, oh oh…

We bare the truth in us
We play with the power of light
We bare an amulet in our soul
Covered with starry dust
We love with the most powerfull warm feeling
Endlessly happy for every new day
Life is a dance with the planets
We live now, this is our time

Now this is our space
And this is our time
Living through dance
We're dancing through life
Dancing through life
In space and time
We're flying again
A life through dance
Is our sign
Dancing through life

Oooo, oh oh…

In space and time
We're flying again
A life through dance
Is our ѕign
Dаncing through life

Oooo, oh oh…
