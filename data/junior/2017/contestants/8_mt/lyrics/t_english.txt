Round and Round

Come on and play this game
Gianluca is my name
Together let us unite
'Cause we're all the same

Don't worry laugh again
There's no rules to explain
I am your guide on this ride
This feels so insane

Always on the run
Ready to have fun

Round and round, spinning to the sound
Life's a whirlpool, a merry-go-round
Round and round, spinning going fast
Life's a topspin, crazy swaying past

Go on and feel the buzz
No matter what one does
We are the best, there's no rest
You don't need to fuss

Fly high and sense the thrill
In you you've got the will
Reachin' new heights flashing lights
Your joy you'll fulfill

Always on the run
Ready to have fun

Round and round, spinning to the sound
Life's a whirlpool, a merry-go-round
Round and round, spinning going fast
Life's a topspin, crazy swaying past

Round jump ribbon
Velvet coffin, move boyfriend
The beetroot rotates on the hunter's roof
When you get under the tunnel you will weigh a zun

Round and round, spinning to the sound
Life's a whirlpool, a merry-go-round
Round and round, spinning going fast
Life's a topspin, crazy swaying past

Round and round, turning together
We continue to dance everywhere
Round jump ribbon
Velvet coffin, move boyfriend
Round and round, spinning going fast
Life's a topspin, crazy swaying pаѕt
