Dawra Tond

Come on and play this game
Gianluca is my name
Together let us unite
'Cause we're all the same

Don't worry laugh again
There's no rules to explain
I am your guide on this ride
This feels so insane

Always on the run
Ready to have fun

Dawra tond, spinning to the sound
Life's a whirlpool, a merry-go-round
Dawra tond, spinning going fast
Life's a topspin, crazy swaying past

Go on and feel the buzz
No matter what one does
We are the best, there's no rest
You don't need to fuss

Fly high and sense the thrill
In you you've got the will
Reachin' new heights flashing lights
Your joy you'll fulfill

Always on the run
Ready to have fun

Dawra tond, spinning to the sound
Life's a whirlpool, a merry-go-round
Dawra tond, spinning going fast
Life's a topspin, crazy swaying past

Dawra durella qabża żigarella
Ċoff tal-bellus, ċaqċaqilu lil għarus
Iż-żunżana idur idur fuq il-bejt tal-kaċċatur
Meta tasal taħt il-mina tagħmel żin żan żun

Dawra tond, spinning to the sound
Life's a whirlpool, a merry-go-round
Dawra tond, spinning going fast
Life's a topspin, crazy swaying past

Dawra tond, induru flimkien
Nallegraw niżfnu ma' kullimkien
Dawra durella qabża żigarella
Ċoff tal-bellus, ċaqċaqilu lil għarus
Dawra tond, spinning going fast
Life's a topspin, crazy swaying pаѕt
