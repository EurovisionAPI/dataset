I Wanna Be a Star

Mom, mom tell me
Where does love live?
Tell me where to find her
To become something
Always look ahead
My star up high

I want to go far
Higher up

Put your hands up in the sky
Spread your wings, prepare to fly
Be the hero that you've become
Sing I wanna be a star
(Put your hands up in the sun)
Life's a party, dream for fun
Be the hero you really are
Sing I wanna be a star

Mom, mom I'm telling you
My dreams
Teach me to fly
With my wings
To reach the top
May I be the winner in life

To touch the sky
Yes I can

Life smiles
I have crazy dreams
I own the sky
Sing I wanna be a star
I will only look ahead
Flying butterfly
I have power, I have light
Sing I wanna be a star

I will always sing
With music and dance
I will laugh

Life smiles
I have crazy dreams
I own the sky
Sing I Wanna

Put your hands up in the sky
Spread your wings, prepare to fly
Be the hero that you've become
Sing I wanna be a star
(Put your hands up in the sun)
Life's a party, dream for fun
Be the hero you really are
Sing I wanna be a star
(I wanna, I wanna, I wanna)
I wanna be a ѕtаr
