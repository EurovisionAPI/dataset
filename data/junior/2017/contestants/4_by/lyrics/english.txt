I am the One

Uh-uh-ummm
Um-uu-um-ummm

Uh-uh-ummm
Um-uu-um-ummm

Uh-uh-ummm
Um-uu-um-ummm

I am your sun, your moon, your universe
Out of millions, don't think, choose me
Hair – wind, skin – goosebumps
You won't notice, but I'm not afraid

And barefoot in the warm snow
I'm the rain in the desert, I'm the strongest
Your wildest dream
I'm like a comet shining in space somewhere
Where my dreams feel good

We will change this planet with our love
Let my victories be called by your name

I'll grow up, but not today
And I don't regret it, I don't care about anything
Music heals and I'm free

Uh-uh-ummm
Um-uu-um-ummm

Uh-uh-ummm
Um-uu-um-ummm

Uh-uh-ummm
Um-uu-um-ummm

I'm the rain in the desert, I'm the strongest
Your wildest dream
I'm like a comet shining in space somewhere
Where my dreams feel good

I'm like a comet shining in space somewhere
Where my dreаmѕ feel good

Uh-uh-ummm
Um-uu-um-ummm

Uh-uh-ummm
Um-uu-um-ummm

Uh-uh-ummm
Um-uu-um-ummm
