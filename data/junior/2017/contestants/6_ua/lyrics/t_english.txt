Don't Stop

I dream of being happy, of seeing the ocean
I dream of travelling the world
I dream of having a cat, a tree house
I dream of acting in films
I want to play the drums
The dream is close…

Along the path of love, again, across the unknown sites
We wander, we wander
Unaccidental fates, we choose our way
We wait, we wait
For colourful days, mother's songs
Are in your mind, in soul, in heart
Go with them through life

Do not stop your heart
Do not stop
Look for your dream
Do not stop
Discover the world
And feel who you are – fly

How can I get a chance to see and understand the real you
Give you all my love, find my way in life
We can live in harmony because we're one, we're family
I see it in your eyes, your loving eyes
You need to find your dream

Give it a try
Wonderful life
Listen to your soul
Let go

Do not stop, do not stop
Do not stop, do not stop

Do not stop
Discover the world
And feel who you аre – fly
Do not ѕtop
