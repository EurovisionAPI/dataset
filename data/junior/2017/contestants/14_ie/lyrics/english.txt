Green Eyes

Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, look at my
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, green eyes
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, look at my
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, green eyes

The will is very beautiful
This is my dream
Never wanted to wake up
These big hills give me happiness
I want to be with them

Are you dancing with me?
I dance with the stars
Take my lid I'll show you

Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, look at my
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, green eyes
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, look at my
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, green eyes

At sea and ashore the colours mix together
I want to be with them

Are you dancing with me?
I dance with the stars
Take my lid I'll show you

Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, look at my
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, green eyes
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, look at my
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, I'll show you

I dance with the stars

Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, look at my
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, green eyes
I'll show you
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, look аt my
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, I'll ѕhow you
