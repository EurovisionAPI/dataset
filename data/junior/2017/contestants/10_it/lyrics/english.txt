My Choice

I choose not to be afraid
To go beyond, beyond these walls
I choose to give wings and wind
To every breath, to every moment of mine

I choose not to be afraid
Not to fear borders and colours
I choose to throw my own smile
Beyond the fence between Heaven and Earth

I am living, I am singing
I am dreaming, I am dancing
I am thinking, I am caring
I have hopes in this life

I choose not to be afraid
To pick my heart and take care of it
I choose to grow the courage
Step by step, journey after journey

I choose not to be afraid
To live listening and to look outside
I choose to leave the ground
Take a deep breath and fly high

I am living, I am singing
I am dreaming, I am dancing
I am thinking, I am caring
I have hopes in this life

From what I choose today
I will build my life
I keep my fears away and
I will open up my eyes

Love is the answer
Love as much you can
Because love will always
Kick the fear away

I'm living, I'm singing
I'm dreaming, I'm dancing
I'm thinking, I'm caring
And I believe in life, I won't be afraid

I'm living, (I live)
I'm singing, (I sing)
I'm dreaming, (I dream)
I'm dancing, (I dance)

I'm thinking, I'm creating
I have hopes in this in life

I choose to give wings and wind
To every breath, to every moment of mine
I will fly above the highest wall
To make a better day
I chooѕe not to be afrаid
