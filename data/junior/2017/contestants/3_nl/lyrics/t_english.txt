Love Me

I see you walking with those cool boys
But you look at me, hey
I'm really sure, hey
You're the cutest girl I've ever seen, hey

If you like sending snaps, please share them with me
And if you like to text for hours, I will make time for you
If you like all the things that you never knew you'd like
Then just hold on to me

Hey, hey, hey
Lo-lo-love me baby
Lo-lo-love me baby, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Lo-lo-love me baby
'Cause I'd really like to love you too
Here we go

Love me now, love me, hey, yeah
Love me now, love me, hey, baby
Love me now, love me, hey, yeah
Love me now, love me, hey, baby

You post a photo and
Even without a filter it's lit, hey
The sun shines on your smile
You're walking in slow motion in the light, hey

If you like walking together and riding our bikes
And if you like watching the stars, on your back in the sand
And if you like all the things that you never knew you'd like
Then just hold on to me

Hey, hey, hey
Lo-lo-love me baby
Lo-lo-love me baby, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Lo-lo-love me baby
'Cause I'd really like to love you too
Here we go

Love me now, love me, hey, yeah
Love me now, love me, hey, baby
Love me now, love me, hey, yeah
Love me now, love me, hey, baby

Stay with me for all of my life

Love me now, love me, hey, yeah
Love me now, love me, baby
Love me now, love me, hey, yeah
Love me now, love me

'Cauѕe I'd reаlly like to love you too
