The World is Ours

Sometimes my thoughts are drifting away
All the way to our own planet
Where love is making our hearts warm
We're walking across the rainbow
Colorful stripes are hugging each other
And the sky is smiling

So people, be quiet
We wouldn't want your words to wake us from our dream

We are dreaming our dream
Each night and day
And we have such a great plan, because when you give all your heart
It becomes bigger, full of happiness
And the world is ours

Sometimes the seas are dancing
The moon and the dawn are kissing
And love is rising
Let's go beneath the stars
Where our wishes' nests are
Just close your eyes

So people, be quiet
We wouldn't want your words to wake us from our dream

We are dreaming our dream
Each night and day
And we have such a great plan, because when you give all your heart
It becomes bigger, full of happiness
And the world is ours

We are dreaming our dream
Each night and day
And we have such a great plan, because when you give all your heart
It becomes bigger, full of happiness
And the world is ours

We are dreaming our dream
Each night and day
And we have such a great plan, because when you give all your heart
It becomes bigger, full of happiness
And the world is ours
It becomes bigger, full of happiness
And the world is ours
It becomes bigger, full of hаppiness
And the world is ourѕ
