Time

The words are hidden and the notebook is empty…
I'm anywhere again, but not here…
Again I didn't have time to say anything…
I won't tolerate it
I'm going mad 'cause I'm ready to start
What is unsaid will arise from my heart
I'll just say hello
Yeah… I'll just say hello
So tired to keep all my feelings inside
Trying to leave all my nightmares behind
I'll just say hello, wowoooow

But as always-ahh, oh time
Time will tell me…
We are on the same wavelength…
After all, for me-ahh, oh time
It's more than tick-tock
That's right, there's no other way

We need to put everything in its place
Take a step and move on
I'll create a whole new world for us, oooh
Who can stop me?
I'm going mad 'cause I'm ready to start
What is unsaid will arise from my heart
I'll just say hello
Yeah… I'll just say hello
So tired to keep all my feelings inside
Trying to leave all my nightmares behind
I'll just say hello, wowoooow

But as always-ahh, oh time
Time will tell me…
We are on the same wavelength…
After all, for me-ahh, oh time
It's more than a tick-tock
That's right, there's no other way

But as always-ahh, oh time
Time will tell me…
We are on the same wavelength…
After all, for me-ahh, oh time
It's more than a tick-tock
That's right, there's no other way

Time is all mine
I know the most important thing in our lives…
Don't watch how doubts are killing your…
Time… all mine
Not a moment, a second, no more…
After all, for me
It's more than tick-tock
This is true, and there is no other way
I'm going mad 'cause I'm ready to ѕtаrt
