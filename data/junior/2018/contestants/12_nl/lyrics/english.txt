Together

When I think of you, the
Gray sky suddenly blue again
Pretend you're standing next to me
And talk to me again

I close my eyes and it seems
Like you're just here again
Far away but also close by
That's how you're with me

We are together, always together
Wherever you go, wherever you are
We'll be together, always forever
Whatever distance, you are my friend

Sometimes it's hard to do
Like I don't miss you at all
I choke back tears
And make a new beginning (oh-oh)

I feel lonely when I see
That friends laugh with each other
Then think of the time with you
And how much I love you

We are together, always together
Wherever you go, wherever you are
We'll be together, always forever
Whatever distance, you are my friend

And when it's dark (when it's dark)
And I miss you again (and I miss you again)
Thinking of the memories that we share

Together, always together
Wherever you go, wherever we are

Together, always together
Wherever you go, wherever you are (wherever we are)
Together, always forever
Whatever diѕtance, you are my friend

You аre my friend
