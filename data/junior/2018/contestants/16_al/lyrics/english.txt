Barbie

(Yes come on)
(I am a strong girl)

I have no secrets
And I'll tell you all
The problem I have
A response awaits you
Tell me barbie
Don't here and don't there
But I think otherwise
I am not fruit and I am not egg

No, don't lead me
Do not judge me
I don't want to think myself
Like a doll that has no mouth

No, don't lead me
Do not judge me
I don't want to think myself
Like a doll that has no mouth

I'm a capkene girl
Like school and at home
How many times I'm alone
I do it again
Tell me barbie
Don't here and don't there
But I think otherwise
I am not fruit and I am not egg

No, don't lead me
Do not judge me
I don't want to think myself
Like a doll that has no mouth

No, don't lead me
Do not judge me
I don't want to think myself
Like a doll that has no mouth

Do not tell me what to do
Why don't want to follow you
Why you call me barbie doll
I'm a smart girl overall

No, don't lead me
Do not judge me
I don't want to think myself
Like a doll that hаѕ no mouth
