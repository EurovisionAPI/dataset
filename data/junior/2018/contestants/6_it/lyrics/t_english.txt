What is Love

When one day comes
I don't know what it will be like
But life will tell me
What is it

I've seen him in a thousand films
Inside the eyes of those who say yes
That's why I'm looking for it here
But where is it
And every now and then I wonder

What is love
What color love has
I don't know
What is love
It's the smile that awaits you one day

It will be born
Like a sun that will warm us
And it will be
The answer that the heart already knows

There's a dream that's here for you
All it takes is a gust of wind
Just one moment
And then you start flying

What is love
What color love has
I don't know
Love is like a dream forever
What is love
It's a feeling, a music, a wonder

It will be born
Like a dawn that will wake us up
And you'll know
In a heartbeat the meaning of love
And it will be
The answer that the heart iѕ alreаdy
