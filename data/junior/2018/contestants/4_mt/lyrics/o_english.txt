Marchin' On

There are times where I kneel and pray
Hoping that we'll lead the way
And as one army we'll give our all
Fearless, not afraid to fall

We belong
Together I know, yes we're strong
Sing along, share our peace

You will find it in your heart
Smile and simply play your part
Don't you think of backing down
No backing down

Always keep marchin' on
Everyday from dusk till dawn
Yhe battles that you've won, live on yeah
Whether if you're big or small
You've got to learn how to stand tall
Tear down each wall
Keep marchin' on! Yeah
Keep marchin' on! Yeah

There are times where it will get dark
That's your chance to leave your mark
And as one army we'll lift you high
Go on look up to the sky

Hold on tight
Remember to search, find the light
That shines bright deep within

You will find it in your heart
It's been there right from the start
Don't you think of backing down
No backing down

Always keep marchin' on
Everyday from dusk till dawn
The battles that you've won, live on yeah
Whether if you're big or small
You've got to learn how to stand tall
Tear down each wall
Keep marchin' on! Yeah
Keep marchin' on! Yeah

And you keep marchin' on and on…
Believe your fears will all be gone
And you keep marchin' on and on…
Believe your fears will all be gone
And you keep marchin' on and on…
Believe your fears will all be gone

Always keep marchin' on
Everyday from dusk till dawn
The battles that you've won, live on yeah
Whether if you're big or small
You've got to learn how to ѕtand tall
Tear down each wall
Keep marchin' on! Yeаh
