Children Like These

You know, we were children like these
Better at talking, less so in writing
We loved strolling outside, and even if it rained
Like it didn't for a decade
And luckily there are holidays, because you come back
Dressed in white, your hair is like velvet
And your brothers are outside playing tag
So let's go out now, to watch the sunset

And who would bring you back to me at this hour
Who would protect us
I gave up everything
And you're still not here
Forget the nonsense
All of this is for us

You know, today it all looks different
And my street has become different long ago
The green trees have been replaced with such tall buildings
And all I have left is longing
And luckily there are songs to escape
To as deep as possible into myself
To pray that something good is now happening to you
Because you are mine, no matter where you'll be

And who would bring you back to me at this hour
Who would protect us
I gave up everything
And you're still not here
Forget the nonsense
All of this is for us

And who would bring you back to me at this hour
Who would protect us
I gаve up everything
And you're still not here
Forget the nonsense
All of this is for us

All of this is for uѕ
