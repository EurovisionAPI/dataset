I Like Everything (I Like Nothing More)

You are live
Around the world on screen
I still don't even know where I'm going today
How much more tomorrow

Forward and backward
Here goes boomerang
Battery at maximum
For now it's all great

I like everything
I like nothing more
I change the filter
Life is blurred
I zoom in here
An emoji comes out there
I never get tired
Running the world from the sofa

I'm going to quit my profile
It can't be just sharing
They already follow me more than a thousand
I already scroll without looking

I'll peek one more time
Just to quench your thirst
I control everything from here
Don't go without a network

I like everything
I like nothing more
I change the filter
Life is blurred
I zoom in here
An emoji comes out there
I never get tired…

I like everything
I like nothing more
I change the filter
Life is blurred
I zoom in here
An emoji comes out there
I never get tired
Running the world from the sofa

But when at night I fall asleep
Dream that I send you my location
And you come to me live and in color
And you take me by the hand

I like everything
I like nothing more
I change the filter
Life is blurred
I like everything
I like nothing more
I change the filter
Life is blurred
I zoom in here
An emoji comes out there
I never get tired
Running the world from the ѕofа
