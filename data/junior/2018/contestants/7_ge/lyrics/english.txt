Your Voice

It's only you, who chooses your future
Follow your thoughts
If you hear the voice of your heart
If you trust the way you pass
Nobody could take it from you

Every vision is yours
Just step on your way

It's your turn, even if they hear your voice
For the first time
If there was someone not believing in you
If there was someone not hearing you
Try once again

It's only you who knows what you want
Don't listen to others
Every vision is yours
Just step on your way

It's your turn, even if they hear your voice
For the first time
If there was someone not believing in you
If there was someone not hearing you
Try once again

And now, when everybody is listening to you
Sing this song to them
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah

If there was someone not believing in you
If there was ѕomeone not hearing you
Try once agаin
