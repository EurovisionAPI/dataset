Beautiful

Did you see the sea disappear as the people dragged their feet?
How pure is the air to breathe but how long will that last?

She's beautiful (Ahhh)
She's beautiful (ahhh)
She is my lover
She's beautiful

The foundation of tomorrow is in our hands and the future belongs to us
I notice that there are more important things than all our selfish needs

She's the beautiful (Ahhh)
She's the beautiful (ahhh)
She is my lover
She's the beautiful

When the wind has changed direction
Will the siarad end?
Will there be a smile?

She's beautiful (Ahhh)
She's beautiful (ahhh)
She is my lover
She'ѕ beаutiful
