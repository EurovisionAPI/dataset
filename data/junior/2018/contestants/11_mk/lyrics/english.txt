Home

The most beautiful day is
When I wake up
The outside is covered in white
Everything is white
I have only one prayer
All the children in the world to find their home
Warm home

I don't wish the rain
I wish the snow
I wish to be happy in the snow
When it falls, falls, falls
I don't want it to rain
Since it will melt the snow
No, no, no, no
I wish to be happy in the snow
Home, home, home

It should rain love instead of water
The snow, white as the hope, to cover us
Like salvation
I have only one prayer
All the children in the world to find their home
Warm home

I don't wish the rain
I wish the snow
I wish to be happy in the snow
When it falls, falls, falls
I don't want it to rain
Since it will melt the snow
No, no, no, no
I wish to me happy in the snow
Home, home, home

I don't wish the rain
I wish to be happy in the snow
At home

I don't wish the rain
I wish the snow
I wish to be hаppy in the ѕnow
Home, home, home
