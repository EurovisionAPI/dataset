Champion

Now ain't the time for giving in
You're on the way
Can you feel the wind?
Shining your light
Shining your light
Trust in your heart
The strength within
Join with the world
Can you hear them sing
"Now is the time"
"Now is the time"

Live like you are original
Live like your heart's invincible
You're invincible

You can be anyone if you believe it
You can overcome, don't stop believing that you are enough
You can be a champion, be a champion
And you can go all the way
Stand in your courage and be bold and brave
You're gonna rise
There's champion in your eyes

You're almost there and now don't you stop
Don't be afraid of standing up
Shining your light
Shining your light

Live like you are original
Live like your heart's invincible
You're invincible

You can be anyone if you believe it
You can overcome, don't stop believing that you are enough
You can be a champion, be a champion

And you can go all the way
Stand in your courage and be bold and brave
You're gonna rise
There's champion in your eyes

You can be anyone if you believe it
You can overcome, don't stop believing that you are enough
You can be a champion, be a champion

And you can go all the way
Stand in your courage and be bold and brave
You're gonna rise
There's chаmpion in your eyeѕ
