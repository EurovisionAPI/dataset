Unbreakable

Ty mozhesh' vedetat' i dalat'
I snova podnyat'sya vvys'
Vse slozhitsya tak, kak nado
Ne toropis'
Ty mozhesh' byt', kem zekhochesh'
Pridumyvat' snoy suizhet
V kontse samoy dolgoy nochi
Budet passvet

I esli temneet nebo
My budem vdvoem
Stoyat' pod zontom
Nam pervyy zhe luchik solntsa
Podarit teplo
I veru v dobro

Prosto snushay sepdtse
Prosto bud' soboy
Eto nashe vremya
Znay, my nepobedimy
Posmotri, nad nami
Milliony zbezd
Zagaday zhelan'e
Znay, my nepobedimy

Vmeste my sil'ney
Otkroy glaza
Idi smeley
K mechte svoey
(Znay, my nepobedimy)
Ne sdavaysya
Vse v troikh pukakh
Pregprady net
Leti na svet
(Znay) my nepobedimy

We're keeping the planet spinning
We're ready to cross the line
It's time to release your feelings
Wake up and shine
Don't listen to all those whisperers
That tell you what's wrong or right
There's more than a million reasons
To up this life

If you ever feel forlornly
So empty and cold
It's me you can hold
This moment is one and only
Whatever this day
Can go any way

If we stay together
We're unbreakable
Through the rain and thunder
We'll fly, no one can stop us
If we stay together
We're unbreakable
Through the snow that's falling
We'll run, no one can stop us

Magic's in the air
I see it clear
Can you believe
Can you believe?
(No way, no one can stop us)
Stronger every day
Unbreakable
Because you're near
Because you're near
(No way) no one cаn stop uѕ
