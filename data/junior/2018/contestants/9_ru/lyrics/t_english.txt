Unbreakable

You can go up and down
And rise up again
Everything will turn out as it should
Take your time
You can be whoever you want
Come up with your own plot
At the end of the longest night
There will be dawn

And if the sky darkens
We'll be together
Stand under an umbrella
We have the first ray of sunshine
Give warmth
And faith in goodness

Just listen to your heart
Just be yourself
This is our time
Know that we are invincible
Look, above us
Millions of stars
Make a wish
Know that we are invincible

Together we are stronger
Open your eyes
Go boldly
To your dream
(Know that we are invincible)
Don't give up
Everything is in your hands
There is no obstacle
Fly to the light
(Know) we are invincible

We're keeping the planet spinning
We're ready to cross the line
It's time to release your feelings
Wake up and shine
Don't listen to all those whisperers
That tell you what's wrong or right
There's more than a million reasons
To up this life

If you ever feel forlornly
So empty and cold
It's me you can hold
This moment is one and only
Whatever this day
Can go any way

If we stay together
We're unbreakable
Through the rain and thunder
We'll fly, no one can stop us
If we stay together
We're unbreakable
Through the snow that's falling
We'll run, no one can stop us

Magic's in the air
I see it clear
Can you believe
Can you believe?
(No way, no one can stop us)
Stronger every day
Unbreakable
Because you're near
Because you're near
(No way) no one cаn stop uѕ
