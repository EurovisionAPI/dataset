Never Without You

A head full of memories
But not a single one that I regret
Laughter every time
Our eyes meet
Days to tell each other
All our stories

And even if time passes
You're never far from me
It's make or break time
The two of us is much more than that

Never without you
I'm happy to have you in my life
Hugging you or giving you a smile
Sorry, it's always been so hard for me
To find the words to say
A little, a lot, no way without you
I love having you in my life so much
A little, a lot, never without you

Indelible years
With you everything is easier
There are highs
There are lows but above all there is you
Whatever we say, whatever we do
You'll always be there

And even if time passes
You're never far from me
It's make or break time
The two of us is much more than that

Never without you
I'm happy to have you in my life
Hugging you or giving you a smile
Sorry, it's always been so hard for me
To find the words to say
A little, a lot, no way without you
I love having you in my life so much
A little, a lot, never without you

Our adventure is so beautiful
A little bit much no way without you
You are the wind that carries my wings
A little bit much no way without you
A timeless flame
A little bit much no way without you
Which is not artificial
A little bit much no way without you

Never without you
I'm happy to have you in my life
Hugging you or giving you a smile
Sorry, it's always been so hard for me
To find the words to say
A little, a lot, no way without you
I love having you in my life ѕo much
A little, а lot, never without you
