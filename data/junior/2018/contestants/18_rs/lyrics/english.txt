World
There is a world
Where love, peace, joy, and beauty live
If you see it
It's yours

The world
Will be left for us
For the right path, you need a pure heart
The one of a child

And let the peace
Forever be the home of every soul
Love is always
The only true winner
The way you think is how it's going to be
Make-believe can become reality
It is possible, it is possible
If you believe

The world
Will be left for us
For the right path, you need a pure heart
Of a child
World
There is a world
Look for it, it's here, like in a hide-аnd-ѕeek
You will find it
If you believe
