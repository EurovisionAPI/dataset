IOU

An angel lives at the bottom of my street
She likes to make tea for me
And we talk about the good people
All we know

I love the love I have
My love for everyone
What I would do without you in my life
You are the top end of my life

Mum and dad
My darling, you are
Sing aloud
IOU
Everything yesterday
Everything today
However, by letter
IOU
All small things
Everything big
Everything I have
IOU
Everything yesterday
Everything today
However, by letter
IOU, IOU

I love the love I have
My love for everyone
What I would do without you in my life
You are the top end of my life

Mum and dad
My darling, you are
Sing aloud
IOU
Everything yesterday
Everything today
However, by letter
IOU, IOU
(IOU) IOU
IOU (IOU)

An angel lives at the bottom of my street
She likes to make tea for me

Mum and dad
My darling, you are
Can os high
IOU
Everything yesterday
Everything today

All small things
Everything big
Everything I have
