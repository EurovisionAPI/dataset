L.E.V.O.N

They know me and smile when they see me
Remember The Words of My Song
Everyone draws or talks to me
My Name Becomes a Synonym for The Song

Dancing and Dancing Takes All You Need
Love With You Is Good

Dancing Alone or All
Making a Move to My Ambassador
They Want Quickly at My Pace
I'm told L.E.V.O.N
If I Go Back
I'm coming back definitely EVN
Remember My Name, We Have Dancing
I'm told L.E.V.O.N

My song always changes mood
And unwittingly they begin to move with me
A little later, when the blood warms up
Still Singing Equal to Me

Dancing and Dancing Takes All You Need
Love With You Is Good

Dancing Alone or All
Making a Move to My Ambassador
They Want Quickly at My Pace
I'm told L.E.V.O.N
If I Go Back
I'm coming back definitely EVN
Remember My Name, We Have Dancing
I'm told L.E.V.O.N

The Song Is My Heart, Dancing My Soul
I share it with you indiscriminately
Each word and tattoo gives you a gift
Dancing Together

Dancing Alone or All
Making a Move to My Ambasѕador
They Want Quickly at My Pace
I'm told L.E.V.O.N
If I Go Back
I'm coming back definitely EVN
Remember My Name, We Have Dаncing
I'm told L.E.V.O.N
