Anyone I want to Be

Used to live in the shadow
Now I'm not afraid to risk it all
I can talk a bit louder
With a power of a thunderstorm

I've got a rebellious state
I feel it getting stronger and stronger day by day
When my heart picks up its rhythm
I won't say stop, I won't say stop

I want to float in the wind
I can be whoever I want to be
I'm flying to an unknown land
I reach beyond sight

I just wanna scream at the top of my lungs
Shout it of the rooftop loud
I speak my heart and I know I can be
Anyone I want to be
Life's never really black or white
There's more to it that meets the eye
I speak my mind and I know I can be
Anyone I want to be

A minute or two, my goal is in front of me
I don't take shortcuts
I hold the wheel with all my might
I can climb any mountain

I've got a rebellious state
I'll be myself that the world
He's already written another plan for me
I'll say stop, I'll say pass

I want to float in the wind
I can be whoever I want to be
I'm flying to an unknown land
Tam-taram-taram-taram

The world today shines with a million cores
I have a precious treasure in my hands
Even if you have to run against the wind
I know you can do it just like I can
Life is not just black and white
Now I'm enjoying every day
I know you can make it like me
Even if you have to run against the wind

The day before yesterday there was uncertainty
Fear that you woke up from sleep
It only takes a moment to be able to
Block everything that was blocked
The day before yesterday there was uncertainty
Fear that you woke up from sleep
It only takes a moment to be able to…

Ah, ah, ah…

Dam, dam, dam, dam, dam

Life's never really black or white
There's more to it than meets the eye
I ѕpeak my mind and I know I can be
Anyone I wаnt to be
