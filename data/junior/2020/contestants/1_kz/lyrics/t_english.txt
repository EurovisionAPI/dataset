Forever

Remember days
I hoped you stay
I never really want to go away
Your way
From your way

Another day, I didn't stay
I think I did it 'cause my heart can't say
I love, with love

Dad I believe in you, you were my friend
Dad is perfect, I love you, you are in my heart

Hide away, I keep it on forever
And fly away, my pain will stay forever
I lie when I say your hand is forever
Remember times for what
I will remember your hand each day that I see

Dad I believe in you, you were my friend
Dad is perfect, I love you, you are in my heart

A melodious bird in the air
Thank you very much, dear father
I am silently weak and unhappy without you
The most brightest ѕun
I know, I feel and I love you, my fаther
