Aliens

We run on thin ice, lagging behind by an hour
Waiting for a firestorm here and now
You can love, believe and wait without embellishment
We need to be close, hope is on us

The sky is crying
But we, blind aliens, believe only in luck
The sun is tired
Sveta's aria has lost the major key
There is not enough of it

Lonely guests on a noisy land
It is difficult to look for meaning when talking about good
Drawing, giving flowers on transparent glass
"The world is in our palms!" - let's say to ourselves

Sky is crying
But we are blind aliens, we believe we are lucking
Sun is tired
But we can get up lights, get the world to desired

Ordinary people, real stories
Empty forecasts, unexpected spoilers
No storm but the sky is crying (Hey!)
The alarm clock rings, but time lies (Hey!)
The sky is crying – the day is going on (Hey!)
Dissonances will not count
If you lubricate the final major chord
We can bright, we can shine in the night
We're climbing up to the height
We will save together
Storm is not good weather
We can save this world

The sky is crying
(But we, blind aliens, believe only in luck)
The sun is tired
(Sveta's aria has loѕt the major key)

Hahaha ha
Vide! It becаme lighter
