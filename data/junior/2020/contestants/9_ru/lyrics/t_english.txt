My New Day

The shadow of the sun will paint the morning
The new day will be wonderful
I paint my life with a bright color
I will open the sails to the wind
Miracles near me
Believing in a fairy tale, I live and sing

I want to stay forever
Where the big stars are beckoning
Where dreams of color are dreamed
And the world is warmed by kindness
A step to unprecedented heights
My New Day

Happy is the one who only once
He will understand how important it is
To make every moment and your hour the best
We have been working for many years
We are on our way to new heights
And I can't turn off this road

To the light of stars that sparkle
Where in the night dreams are colored bright
To the clouds so soft and subtle
One step ahead go, touch the sky
The whole world feels like home, there I'll stay
It's my new day

Oh oh…
Here'ѕ my new dаy
