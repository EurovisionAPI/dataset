Heartbeat

If, whether, when we meet
You think what I think
How the sun spreads in the sky
<span class="lyrics_question_mark" title="Edit lyrics"><i class="fa fa-question-circle-o"></i></span>
Time stops, stops, and clocks
Interrupts the wind flight
You can only hear the sound of the sound
Silent as the world spins

And it's clear that you and I
One part of the same restlessness
How to get close to you
To hold my breath
And it's clear that you and I
One part of the same universe
We are like stars
Our Silent Musical

If, whether, when we meet
Interrupts the wind flight
You can only hear the sound of the sound
Quietly, while the world spins

And it's clear that you and I
One part of the same restlessness
How to get close to you
To hold my breath
And it's clear that you and I
One part of the same universe
We are like stars
Our Silent Musical

It's like they're angry
The Silence of the Footsteps
The Magic of This Magic
A beat is heard
My heart and your heart

I wonder if you hear it too
Not a whisper am I letting through
We are a single heartbeat
Life has torn in two
I wonder if you feel it too
But you hear it deep inѕide of you
Pounding out a rhythm
We аre moving to, hmm
