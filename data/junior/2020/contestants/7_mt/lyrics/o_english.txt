Chasing Sunsets

As the sun was risin'
I looked out over the horizon
Over the horizon
There were birds roamin' free
Flyin' over the deep blue sea
The deep blue sea
And I could hear echoes
So gentle that their sweetness flows
Flows down the steady stream

Chasing sunsets here and far
As they follow the southern star
And they travel the world breathin' out
It's what their life is all about
It's what their life is all about

As the seasons slowly change
They glide down on the mountain range
And far, far from other crowds
You see them pass through the gathering clouds
You see them flow down the steady stream, yeah

Chasing sunsets here and far
As they follow the southern star
And they travel the world breathin' out
It's what their life is all about
It's what their life is all about

Red and orange will blend
As the day comes to an end
It feels like an illusion

Chasing sunsets here and far
As they follow the southern star
Chasing sunsets here and far
It's what their life is all about
It's what their life iѕ all аbout
