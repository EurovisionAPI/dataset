I imagine

Na na na…

Oops, there is no more flowers on the balcony
Drat! They wilted in my fingers
Oops, it was not the good season
But spring will come back

Oops, I dreamt we were a lot
To repaint the walls of our cities
And leave our hands' marks
Not just on our touch screens

I can't help it that's who I am
I can't help it I believe
The "believe no more" the "don't believe"
It's not for me

Everything starts with an "I imagine"
At the back of your mind
A dream that takes shape
That nothing can stop
Tell me what you imagine
Sing it at the top of you voice
Pass on the message to your neighbor
Hey
I'm ready

Lalala lalala lalala, I imagine
Lalala lalala lalala, I imagine
Lalala lalala lalala, I imagine
I imagine
Lalala lalala lalala
Tomorrow I imagine

Oops, I've imagined a world
Where people hold each other in their arms
To do the nicest round dance
A dance between you and me

Go! There is always something to do
Even in the middle of the living room
On our screens, hands in the air
To undergo a revolution

I can't help it that's who I am
I can't help it I believe
The "don't believe anymore" the "don't believe"
It's not for me

Everything starts with a "I imagine"
At the back of your mind
A dream that takes shape
That nothing can stop
Tell me what you imagine
Sing it at the top of you voice
Pass on the message to your neighbor
Hey
I'm ready

Lalala lalala lalala, I imagine
Lalala lalala lalala, I imagine
Lalala lalala lalala, I imagine
I imagine
Lalala lalala lalala
Tomorrow I imagine

So, it's true
It's not always joyful
In our hearts it'ѕ
A bit like a fight
And you, tomorrow
What do you do
Imagine with me

Lalala lalala lalala, I imagine
Lalala lalala lalala, I imagine
Lalala lalala lalala, I imagine
I imagine
Lalala lalala lalala, I imagine

Oh tomorrow, I imagine
Oh tomorrow, I imagine
Oh tomorrow, I imagine
Oh tomorrow, I imаgine
