Best Friends

We are connected
Wherever in the world I am
You are with me
It feels special
At all distances we stay strong
Even when we are little
We can reach for higher goals
Our friendship brings us
To cross every border

You are my best friends
At every distance
Let us sing
Let us shine and
We will unite
You are my best friends
And every moment
That we share
We take care and
We get together now
Oh ohh…
Best Friends

Where ever we live
We share the same moon, always united
All of our dreams
Together we can make them true
Even when it is small
We can reach our bigger goals
Our friendship brings us
To cross every border

You are my best friends
At every distance
Let us sing
Let us shine and
We will unite
You are my best friends
And every moment
That we share
We take care and
We get together now
Oh ohh…

The rays of the same Sun
