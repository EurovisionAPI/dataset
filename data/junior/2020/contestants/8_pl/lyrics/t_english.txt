I'll Be Standing

I got a heart full of dreams
And they'll never go away
I have doubts, I have fears
But they won't get in my way

I want more every day
I'll make the dream come true
I'm not afraid of winding roads, I want to go against the tide

I'll take it all
And every day, every night
I'll remember dreams have power

Standing up
Rising up
Living in my dream

Even when
Times get tough
I'll be standing

I'll be standing
I'll be standing
I'll be standing

Everything is possible
When hope burns in us
Believing it makes sense
Completes every day

I want more every day
I'll make the dream come true
I'm not afraid of winding roads, I want to go against the tide

I'll take it all
And every day, every night
I'll remember dreams have power

Rise and
To be strong
Living your dream

Even when
Something will hurt us
I'll be a force

I'll be a force
I'll be a force
I'll be a force

I'll be standing
I'll be ѕtаnding
