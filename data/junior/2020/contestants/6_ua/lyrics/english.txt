Open Up

When you're giving something
To who's asking for
Well, you should keep on going forward to change this world

Oh, were they right?
To survive any sorrow
You have to be full of
You have to be full of
Love…

Open up
Spread your shining
Open your heart
Come on, shine to everyone

This is the right moment, this is the right time
When your heart is whispering to you
Come on
Open up

The boat is rolling
The bottom is frightening
But you are the argonaut who has found his fleece

When I was blind
I kept on going
And heard it calling, calling

Open up
Spread your shining
Open your heart
Come on, shine to everyone

This is the right moment, this is the right time
When your heart is whispering to you
Come on
Open up

(Spread your shining)
You, open up
(Come on, shine to everyone)

It is the right moment, this is the right time
When your heart is whispering to you
Come on! Come on! Come on
Open up

This is the right moment, this is the right time
When your heаrt is whiѕpering to you
Come on
Open up
