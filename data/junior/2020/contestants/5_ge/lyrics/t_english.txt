You Are Not Alone

All my feelings grown
Wanna show it all
People moving, going
Days are gone

Sing World
Our World
Near the sun
You, too, oh

I know
I know you'll make it all
You know
You are not alone
Earth Sings Something
We'll be together again soon
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh

Opening your doors with your heart
Coming Song Time
We will sing together soon
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Opening your doors with your heart
Oh-oh-oh-ooh

I know
I know you'll make it all
You know
You are not alone
Earth Sings Something
We'll be together again soon
The Time to Come
You are not alone
You are not alone

On Eаrth
You Muѕt Love
