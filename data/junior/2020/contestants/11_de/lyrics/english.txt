Stronger With You

You see the pictures and it leaves you speechless
Tell me, do you also feel the anger and despair?
Do you also know this fear and feel powerless?
I wish from you

Don't look away anymore, even if it would be so much easier
Scream even louder, there's a lot more in you
And I, I believe, I believe in you so much
Yes, I'm waiting here for you

You gotta stand up and help me please
I'm on my knees
Begging you to stop the hurting, the bleeding
This is my dream and I need you to be on my team
I do, 'cause I'm stronger with you

You see the future and you know you can do it
Tell me, do you also feel the courage and the reconciliation?
Always listen to your heart, dare and dare
I wish from you

Don't look away anymore, even if it would be so much easier
Scream even louder, there's a lot more in you
And I, I believe, I believe in you so much
Yes, I'm waiting here for you

You gotta stand up and help me please
I'm on my knees
Begging you to stop the hurting, the bleeding
This is my dream and I need you to be on my team
I do, 'cause I'm stronger with you

'Cause I'm stronger, I'm stronger with you
'Cause I'm stronger with you

'Cause I'm stronger with you, you, you
Give me your hand and I'll take you on this journey

You gotta stand up and help me please
I'm on my knees
Begging you to stop the hurting, the bleeding
This is my dream and I need you to be on my team
I do, 'cause I'm stronger with you

'Cause I'm stronger, I'm stronger with you
'Cause I'm stronger with you
'Cause I'm stronger with you
'Cаuse I'm ѕtronger with you
