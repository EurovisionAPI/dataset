Don't close your eyes

(God save me)

Hey, where is the way to heaven's hell
That's what I ask when I feel broken

Look around what's happening abounds
And listen to the frequency of a sound
Of the beat, of a heartbeat, of your death beat

Don't close your eyes
And pray all the night
Try to call all angels
To save our lives

How do you feel now?
After all fails in love
Embraced by devil's arms

Look around what's happening abounds
And listen to the frequency of a sound
Of the beat, of a heartbeat, of your death beat

Don't close your eyes
And pray all the night
Try to call all angels
To save our lives

Let me get out of here
Let me get out of here
Let me get out of here
Let me get out of here

Save me

Don't close your eyes (Stay awake)
And pray all the night (Say your prayer now)
Try to call all angels (Angels above)
To save our lives (Save our lives)

Don't close your eyes (Don't close your eyes)
To sаve our liveѕ
