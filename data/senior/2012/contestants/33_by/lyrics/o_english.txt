We Are The Heroes

When the night is falling from the sky
Just keep driving on a highway
When the world is deaf to all your cries
Just keep going, you'll be there someday

You're not alone, we're against them all
Hold on to me, I'll never let you fall
Even if someday all hope is gone
I will not give up

Whatever's standing in my way, we'll make it through the day
'Cause we are the winners, we are the heroes
We're breaking down the walls, we're gonna hit them all
'Cause we are believers, we are the dreamers

No matter what they say, no matter what they do
I'll make it alright, I'll make it for you
We're breaking down the walls
We are the heroes

As I stand beneath the starry sky
I just lose faith in gravity
And it feels like I can learn to fly
Bring to life all my fantasies

You're not alone, we're against them all
Hold on to me, I'll never let you fall
Even if someday all hope is gone
I will not give up

Whatever's standing in my way, we'll make it through the day
'Cause we are the winners, we are the heroes
We're breaking down the walls, we're gonna hit them all
'Cause we are believers, we are the dreamers

No matter what they say, no matter what they do
I'll make it alright, I'll make it for you
We're breaking down the walls
We are the heroes, we are the heroes

Whatever's standing in my way, we'll make it through the day
'Cause we are the winners, we are the heroes
We're breaking down the walls, we're gonna hit them all
'Cause we are believers, we are the dreamers

No matter what they say, no matter what they do
I'll make it alright, I'll make it for you
We're breaking down the walls
We аre the heroeѕ
