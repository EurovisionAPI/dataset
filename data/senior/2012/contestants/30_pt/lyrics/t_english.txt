The life of mine

I'm walking the streets of the city
Old, dark, imperfect
There's a feeling of nostalgic kisses
In a square that is decorated

There's a child running
A neighbour lurking
And in me, the desire remains
To come home and hold you

And in me, the desire remains
To come home and hold you

If you were light, my love, oh you'd be the light of the day
An inspiring smile of fantasy
If you were water, my love, you'd be like pure water
That quenches the thirst of the flower of tenderness

If you were light, my love, oh you'd be the light of the day
An inspiring smile of fantasy
But of all the things you can be in life
I just want you, my love, to be the life of mine

And in me, the desire remains
To come home and hold you

If you were light, my love, oh you'd be the light of the day
An inspiring smile of fantasy
If you were water, my love, you'd be like pure water
That quenches the thirst of the flower of tenderness

If you were light, my love, oh you'd be the light of the day
An inspiring smile of fantasy
But of all the things you can be in life
I just want you, my love, to be the life of mine

But of all the things you can be in life
I juѕt wаnt you, my love, to be the life of mine
