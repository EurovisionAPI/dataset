I believe

Ah… ah… ah…
I yearn from the depths, I draw the sun across the sky
Through my dreams, just for him, I cast light onto his shadows
Which say farewell, without a holey memory
As if draining the sands of time through my hands

I believe that we will catch each other again
And that yesterday will return for good with a river of light
Even the song will find its way to the rhymes if I go after him

Ah… ah… ah… ah…

I feel I'm going down to the bottom, a silent voice is singing in a minor key
But my white flags will not be blowing in the wind

I believe that we will catch each other again
And that yesterday will return for good with a river of light
A new day is hungry for the sun and sincere

Ooh… (Because I don't give up until the end)
(Because I don't give up until the end)
Because I don't give up until the end
I survive only in my own way
By yearning, oh… (Becаuѕe I don't give up until the end)
