Beautiful Song

I was born in distant nineteen-eighty
The year that Irish Johnny Logan won
Thirty years or more, they still remember
So dream away, today's the day, I'm singing my song

When I join this grand parade of winners
And we've made this song a worldwide hit
I will buy oh my own mic to sing in
And all the jobs I've had before I'm surely gonna quit

Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows and plays on and on
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves
Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows and plays on and on
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves

My mamma said to grow and be a singer
Dad just smiled and gave me my guitar
I did my best and I'll be so much better
Brightest of the highest and the farthest of the stars

And on the day when Sir Mick Jagger phones me
Tell him please that I am very busy
Writing brand new songs with Paul McCartney
"So sorry, Mick, I'll call you back, one day I'll call you back"

Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows and plays on and on
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves
Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows and plays on and on
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves

Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves

Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows and plays on and on
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves
(Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows and plays on and on)
Beautiful song that everybody hums аnd everybody loveѕ
