The social network song (oh oh uh oh oh)

Ooh… ooh… (I like)

Are you ready for a little chat and a song about the Internet?
It's a story 'bout a social door you've never seen before
If you wanna be seen by everyone
Wanna be in the dream and have some fun
If you wanna be on the hook, simply take a look

Oh oh, ooh oh oh…
Everybody loves you so
Ooh ooh, ooh oh oh…
Everybody lets you know

Do you wanna be more than just a friend?
Do you wanna play cybersex again?
If you wanna come to my house
Then click me with your mouse

Hello, ooh oh oh…
Never gonna let you go

You're loggin' in, then it begins
And your computer is waking you, taking your time away
The scene is right for social light
You're on the Internet, anywhere, anytime, night and day

Oh oh, ooh oh oh… (I like)
Everybody loves you so
Ooh ooh, ooh oh oh… (Mi piace)
Never gonna let you go

So you wanna make love with me?
Am I really your cup of tea?
Are you really the one that's you and am I really me?

Oh oh, ooh oh oh… (I like)
Everybody loves you so
Social network, oh… (Mi piace)
Never gonna let you go

You're loggin' in with just a friend
But soon the Internet's beeping and peeping around the bend
We used to greet friends on the street
But now it's googling, giggling, gaggling when we meet

Beep beep, ooh oh oh…
How about a little chat?
Oh oh, network fans…
Meet you on the Internet!

Do you really like politics? Wanna talk about dirty tricks?
Are you really a sex machine or just some beauty queen?
Everybody is better than before
Everybody is calling out for more
Everybody in cyberville is knocking on your door

Beep beep, ooh oh oh…  (I like)
Everybody does a show
Ooh ooh, ooh oh oh… (Mi piace)
If you like it, click and go

Now you know it is easy loggin' in
For a little more fun and cyber sin
Wanna know what the net's about?
The hard part's loggin' out?

Ooh ooh, ooh oh oh… now I've got a million friends
Goodbye network fаns, this is how the story endѕ
Ooh ooh (Beep beep)
