Shake your booty

We are ready, jewellery 24 carat, our beer is one-two degrees
Dialect, yeah, the two of us are stars, looting bars, we are ready
And all the people shout: "Heya heya hey"

We are party Indians, wearing feathers on our head
And now get your pots out, the noodle soup gang arrives
Girls, yay, haven't seen such hustle bustle for a long time
And they dance and they shake on the poles, on the bars
I am enchanted, girls, look how they sprawl, uh-huh…

Come on, shake your booty, shake your (ooh ooh)
Shake your booty, yeah, yeah, that's the way I like it
Come on, shake your booty, shake your (ooh ooh)
Shake your booty, as you are what I want

And I enter the club, the ladies have fine jewellery
But it's there, there, where you don't expect it at first
I only look at her, she dances on the stripper pole
I'm ready to go, lots of women, I don't miss out on anything

"Noodle soup gang, what's up?" and everybody shouts: "Ho ho"
And women are dancing, they only go low, low
She wraps me around her finger, she wants a winner, winner
And then she can jump, jump, booty shake , bad finger

Come on, shake your booty, shake your (ooh ooh)
Shake your booty, yeah, yeah, that's the way I like it
Come on, shake your booty, shake your (ooh ooh)
Shake your booty, as you are what I want

Come on, shake your booty, shake your (ooh ooh)
Shake your booty, yeah, yeah, that's the way I like it
Come on, shake your booty, shake your (ooh ooh)
Shake your booty, as you are what I want

Your booty has feelings, your booty is a part of you
Don't put it on chairs, your booty has an opinion, yeah
Your booty wants movement, so shake, shake, shake
Your booty wants encounters, come on, give it what it needs

Your booty doesn't get tired, your booty tells something about you
Come, shake it, it wants it, so that the house starts vibrating
Your booty has to be ready, so shake, shake, shake
Your booty has to be ready, come on, give it what it needs

Come on, shake your booty, shake your (ooh ooh)
Shake your booty, yeah, yeah, that's the way I like it
