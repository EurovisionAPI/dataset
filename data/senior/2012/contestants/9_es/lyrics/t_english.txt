Stay with me

Sorry if I didn't know how to say
That you were everything to me
Sorry for the pain

I'm sorry for each tear
I know I don't deserve more
But if I don't have you here, I can't live
Stay with me, don't leave

Forgive me if I didn't know how to love you, love
It wasn't my heart
Stay with me, stay with me
If you're not here, the sun doesn't rise

There are no memories of yesterday
Only the hours on your skin, loving you
Stay with me, don't leave

Forgive me if I didn't know how to love you, love
It wasn't my heart
Stay with me, stay with me
If you're not here, the sun doesn't rise

And now that I see you going
I know I won't forget you

(If I didn't know how to love you, love)
If I didn't know how to love you, love
(It wasn't my heart) No…
Stay with me, stay with me
If you're not here, the sun doesn't rise

And now that I see you going (And now that I see you going)
I know I won't forget you (I know I won't forget you)
Stay with me, stаy with me
If you're not here, the sun doesn't riѕe
