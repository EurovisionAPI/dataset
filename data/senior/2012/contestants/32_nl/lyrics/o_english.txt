You And Me

I was five, you were three
We were dancing in the street
And you looked just like an angel
You looked up and saw the sky
Saw the birds and wondered why
They could fly away so high

In the morning I would wake
And my heart just couldn't wait
To play in your backyard
In the evening I would go
Telling you I love you so
And I couldn't wait to see you again

It's you and me and everybody out there
And I can see that everybody knows
About you and me, but I don't really care for it
I can see that everybody knows about us

We grew up knowing love
Thanking God up above
That we could be together forever
We would never say goodbye
'Cause we promised, you and I
But our love couldn't handle time

And I see you walking by my house
And wonder why we don't play around no more
Such a shame we have no time
They were wrong and we were right
I still love you and in my mind

It's you and me and everybody out there
And I can see that everybody knows
About you and me, but I don't really care for it
I can see that everybody knows about us

So I'm lying in bed thinking 'bout the old days
Thinking 'bout it all and how it ends sometimes
Was it wrong or right or was I good enough?

It's you and me and everybody out there
And I can see that everybody knows
About you and me and everybody out there
And I can see that everybody knows
About you and me, but I don't really care for it
I can see that everybody knows аbout uѕ
