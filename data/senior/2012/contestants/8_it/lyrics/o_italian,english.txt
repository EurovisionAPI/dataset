L'amore è femmina (Out of love)

Unbelievable, I can't wait to go
But like a rolling stone, you hit me – boom boom boom
If you were my king, would I be your queen?
Stop breaking up my heart, you kill me – boom boom boom

(Day and night, it's a fight) Don't know where you are
When I'm close you're far, oh, no no no
(Day and night, it's a lie) I waste my tears and you shoot pool

L'amore è femmina, se non riceve non si da
(Tic tac, non riceve non si da)
This is the mess you left, I'm out of love and it's a fact
(You left, out of love and it's a fact)
I'm sure you'll smile, you have to go
You're an independent grown man after all
Out of love, must have been sent from up above
Lala lala lala la...

Ooh... lala lalala...

Have you turned to stone? King without a throne
You're great, but not impressive, lots of up and low
It's so typical: when it's time to go
You knock me on the floor – my heart goes boom, boom, boom

(Day and night, it's a fight) Don't know where to start
When you're close I'm far, no no no no
(Day and night, it's a lie) I dried my tears, but you want more

L'amore è femmina, se non riceve non si da
(Tic tac, non riceve non si da)
Clean up the mess you left, I'm out of love and it's a fact
(You left, out of love and it's a fact)
I'm sure you'll smile, ready to go
You're an independent grown man after all
Out of love, must have been sent from up above
Lala lala lala la...

Ma che caldo fa, ooh...
I'll let you think twice, I don't wanna cause any pressure
But have you asked yourself why I bought a brand new gun shot

L'amore è femmina, e non riceve non si da
(Tic tac, non riceve non si da)
La prendo comoda, calcolo le possibilità
(Tic tac, una possibilità)
Quello che vuoi se non ce l'hai
Siamo tutti insoddisfatti, come mai?
Femmina, se non riceve non ѕi da
Lala lala lala lа...
