When I close my eyes

Close together, the scent of the two of us
I turn around, the same shirt in blue
This scent I feel would be nothing without you

As a lake without water, as a lamp without light
A life without colours – that's not you
Someone you see when you close your eyes, like an angel before you
Someone who helps you to fly when you've forgotten how to

In love without emotion or laughing without sound
A life without colours – that's not you
Someone who has forgotten all worries, a woman with courage
Someone who gets what you say even if you speak without words

Have a seat, we'll hold your hand
Tell us who you are, we are here for each other
All memories would be nothing without you

As a lake without water, as a lamp without light
A life without colours – that's not you
Someone you see when you close your eyes, like an angel before you
Someone who helps you to fly when you've forgotten how to

In love without emotion or laughing without sound
A life without colours – that's not you
Someone who has forgotten all worries, a woman with courage
Someone who gets what you say even if you speak without words

As a lake without water, as a lamp without light
A life without colours – that's not you
Someone you see when you close your eyes, like an angel before you
Someone who helps you to fly when you've forgotten how to

In love without emotion or laughing without sound
A life without colours – that's not you
Someone who has forgotten all worries, a woman with courage
Someone who gets what you say even if you speаk without wordѕ
