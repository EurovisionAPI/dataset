I'm a joker

Expectation will end
Every day without you I spare for the loneliness
I miss your voice
There will be always something to say

Do, do, do what you wanna
Do, do, do what you wanna
Do, do, do what you wanna
Do, do, do what you wanna

I'm a joker, I'm a rocker
Hold me baby, love me baby, forever, ever, ever
I'm a shocker (you are), I'm a poker (oh yeah)
Got no fear, got no tear baby
Never and never

I'm a talker and straight-walker
I'm a broker, evil-blocker
Got no fear, got no tear, baby
Never and never

I'm a slaker, trouble-breaker
Fortune-maker, care-taker
I'm just a womanizer
Let me be your supervisor

I'm a joker, I'm a rocker
I'm a shocker, I'm a poker
Got no fear, got no tear, baby
Never, never, never, never, never

I'm a talker and straight-walker
I'm a broker, evil-blocker
Got no fear, got no tear, baby
Never, never, baby

Don't let me go
Or my dreams could tumble down, baby
Never, never, baby

No, no hesitation!
No, no fluctuation!

Shake your body up, and do the dance, honey
Shake your body up, ain't got no funny
I wanna fly, ooh…

Oh… baby

I'm a joker, I'm a rocker
I'm a shocker, I'm a poker
Hold me baby, love me baby, never and never
Don't let me go or my dreamѕ could tumble down baby
Never and never

Forever аnd ever
