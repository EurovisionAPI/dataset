Echo (You and I)

You and I, you and I

I hear the echo of our rhythmic steps
Marching, never in the same direction
We move on, but what are we running after?

I hear the echo of our dreams, of our desires
Every day until the night
We practice, and what are we running after?

We're confused, we hope
Somewhere we get lost
One day we will see each other again

In my dreams, in my dreams
In my heart, in my mind
I see you and I, there is you and I

I hear the echo of our swinging steps
That and there, always the same dance
We move on, but what are we running after?

We're confused, we hope
Somewhere we get lost
One day we will see each other again

In my dreams, in my dreams
In my heart, in my mind
I see you and I, there is you and I

There is you and I
There is you and I

I hear the echo of your voice moving away from me
The echo of a love that one day will return
It carries me off and I run after you

We're confused, we hope
Somewhere we get lost
One day we will see each other again

In my dreams, in my dreams
In my heart, in my mind
I see you and I, there iѕ you аnd I
