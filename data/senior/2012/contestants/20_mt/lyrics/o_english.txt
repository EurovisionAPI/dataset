This Is The Night

Hey, look at me and you'll see that I'm into you
Time to believe and achieve, I will stand by you
As from this moment on, you and I can reach the stars
All I need is one more chance

This is the night, this is the night
I will be the star, let me into your heart
This is my life, this is the life
I've been waiting for, I'll be back with more

Singing eh eh eh eh… yeah eh eh eh…
Yeah eh eh eh… yeah eh eh eh…
This is the night, this is the night
I'll be flying high, this is the night

Hey, I believe you and me, we are meant to be
I can't set you free, can't you see this is killing me?
As from this moment on, you and I can reach the stars
All I need is one more chance

This is the night, this is the night
I will be the star, let me into your heart
This is my life, this is the life
I've been waiting for, I'll be back with more

Singing eh eh eh eh… yeah eh eh eh…
Yeah eh eh eh… yeah eh eh eh…
This is the night, this is the night
I'll be flying high, this is the night

Let me into your heart
Eh eh eh eh… yeah eh eh eh…
Yeah eh eh eh… yeah eh eh eh…
(This is the night, this is the night)

This is the night  (This is the night, this is the night)
(I will be the star, let me into your heart)
(This is my life, this is the life)
(I've been waiting for, I'll be back with more)

Singing eh eh eh eh… yeah eh eh eh…
Yeah eh eh eh… yeаh eh eh eh…
This is the night, this is the night
I'll be flying high, this iѕ the night
