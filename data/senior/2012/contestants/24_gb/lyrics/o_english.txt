Love will set you free

So graceful and pure
A smile bathed in light
No matter the distance
A miracle of sight

Though I should have known
I could not turn away
When faced with your beauty
No reason can stay

As you kiss him in the moonlight
With heavy words I say

If you love someone, follow your heart
'Cause love comes once if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever, the hurt will run deep
Only love can set you free

Trust in your dreams
Run with no fear
And if you should stumble
Remember I'm near

As a ghost I will walk
I'll look deep in my soul
I might find another
You gave me that hope

So as you kiss him in the moonlight
With heavy words I say

If you love someone, follow your heart
Because love comes once, if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever and the hurt will run deep
Only love can set you free

And if you love someone, follow your heart
'Cause love comes once, if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever, the hurt will run deep
Love will ѕet you free, yeаh....
