Love Me Back

Oh, hey hey… baby, love me back today
Never ever sink my ship and sail away
Oh, oh oh… baby, don't shut me down
Give me all the love I need and I'll be gone

I'm a lonely sailor drinking the night away
My ship is made from hope
She's searching for your bay
But you don't care

Hop on to my ship, baby, I'll make you fly
You love me and you know that, baby, don't you lie
Like me like I like you and say na nani nani nani na…

Oh, oh oh… we need a bit of rock 'n' roll
Baby, don't you crush my soul and make me fall
Oh, hey hey, baby, love me back today
Don't you ever sink my ship and sail away

Hop on to my ship, baby, I'll make you fly
You love me and you know that, baby, don't you lie
Like me like I like you and say na nani nani nani na…
Na nanani nanana nanana na na…

Pirates, high seas, cautions, cannons and potions
A sailor's passion can always conquer the oceans
Sing with me, my children

Hop on to my ship, baby, I'll make you fly
You love me and you know that, baby, don't you lie
Like me like I like you and ѕay na nani nani nani na…
Na nanana nanana nanana na nana…
Hayde!

Na nanana nanana nanana na nanana nanana…
Na nanana nanana nanana na nanа…
