Stay

I hear music as I walk down the street
Start moving to the rhythm, heart is pumping the beat
I hear the people shout out: "Turn up the music louder"
Better start running if you can't stand the heat

What's it doin' to me? I feel it settin' me free
It's like I'm losin' all control
You know it's makin' me hot and baby I don't stop
It's like a fire in my soul

I don't know what I'm doing tonight
But this rush, it is making me stronger
I don't know if it's wrong or it's right
But I know I want you to stay (Nana nana nana)
Stay (Nana nana nana)

My heart beats faster as I'm scanning the crowd
My meters are peaking, I can tell you're around
It's like I'm on a (high now), nothing can pull me (down now)
Sirens are calling and I can't kill the sound

What's it doin' to me? I feel it settin' me free
It's like I'm losin' all control
You know it's makin' me hot and baby I don't stop
It's like a fire in my soul

I don't know what I'm doing tonight
But this rush, it is making me stronger
I don't know if it's wrong or it's right
But I know I want you to stay (Nana nana nana)
Stay (Nana nana nana)

Work it, move your body, baby
You better (work) – nana nana nana
You better (work) – nana nana nana
Come on now, work it, move your body, baby
You better (work) – nana nana nana
You better (work)

I don't know what I'm doing tonight
But this rush, it is making me stronger
I don't know if it's wrong or it's right
But I know I want you to stay

I don't know what I'm doing tonight
But this rush, it is making me stronger
I don't know if it's wrong or it's right
But I know I want you to ѕtay (Nana nana nana)
Stay (Nana nana nanа)
