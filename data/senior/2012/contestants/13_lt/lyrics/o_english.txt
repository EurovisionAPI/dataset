Love Is Blind

When the day becomes the night, you know that I think of you
And I cannot control my heart, it's crying for you
Loneliness is killing me, I'm helpless without your love
Knowing when you touch someone else, I can't understand

Now it's tearing me apart, I want you back
And it's made me realise just what I had

Love is blind, it's true, nobody is like you
My endless melody I play for me and you
Love is blind, it's true, I'm on my knees for you
'Cause I'd give it all I can to have you back again
Love is blind

I just can't believe you're gone and I let it slip away
I can't believe I was the one who caused you pain
I said you should know deep down inside she didn't mean a thing to me, yeah
What can I do to win back your heart and make you to stay?

I can't believe, can't believe you're gone
I can't believe…

Love is blind, it's true, nobody is like you
My endless melody I play for me and you
Love is blind, it's true, I'm on my knees for you
'Cause I'd give it all I can to have you back agаin
Love is blind
