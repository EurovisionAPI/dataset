Listen

Listen to the horizon
Listen to how far it takes you
Listen to what the wind has to say
Listen

Watch as darkness approaches
Wait – the light remains within us
Listen to how your land breathes
Listen

Listen to what has fallen silent
Just listen to these simple moments
Listen – the heart too has a voice

The path has passed into shadow
I look and keep on looking
Silence has the power to resound
I wait for you here, halfway there
Listen to my voice calling you

Listen to what has fallen silent
Just listen to these simple moments
Listen – the heart too has а voice

Liѕten to me now
