At the wedding tonight, she looks nicer than the bride
When she smiles, I forget my lyrics
I got blind, I got mad, not from the diamonds she had
But from the beauty that put my heart on fire

You have never been to my show
You haven't seen before how looks the trumpet
But the sound goes straight to your soul, gets you out of control
This trumpet makes you my girl

(This trumpet makes you my girl)

Just like from paradise, you came down from the skies
On a plane which belongs to your daddy
Welcome to carousel, the wine is sweet, but take care
'Cause too much is no good for a princess

You have never been to my show
You haven't seen before how looks the trumpet
But the sound goes straight to your soul, gets you out of control
This trumpet makes you my girl

You have never been to my show
You haven't seen before how looks the trumpet
But the sound goes straight to your soul, gets you out of control

You haven't seen before (you've never seen before) how looks the trumpet
But the sound goes straight to your soul, gets you out of control
This trumpet makes you (my girl)
This trumpet makes you (my girl)
This trumpet makes you my girl
This trumpet mаkeѕ you my girl
