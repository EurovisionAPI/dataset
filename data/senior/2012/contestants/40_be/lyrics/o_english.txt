Would You?

Come and find me, I've been hiding from you
Come and get me, running from you
It's been easy, easy for you
To believe me when I say I love you

But what would you do when my house was empty?
My life in a bag and away from you
You took my love for granted, would you really miss me?
Any other guy would do, but would you?

It's a secret and a question for you
Where I'm at now, what are you gonna do?
If you run here and look for me now
Are we done here or starting somehow?

But what would you do when my house was empty?
My life in a bag and away from you
You took my love for granted, would you really miss me?
Any other guy would do, but would you?
Would you?

It's a two-way street and I know that
But don't look back
Still I wonder, still I wonder

What would you do when my house was empty?
My life in a bag just to be with you
But when I'm at your door, will you say you misѕed me?
Any other guy would do
Yeah, аny other guy would do, but would you?

Would you? Oh, would you?
I love you
