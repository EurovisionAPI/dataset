Party For Everybody

I'm spreading a tablecloth carefully, waiting for my children
The dough is rising and my heart is cheering

Party for everybody – dance
Come on and dance
Come on and dance
Come on and boom boom

The house is full of my dear children, who have just returned
The house is full of my dear children, who have just returned
I am going to put on a green dress and a red shawl
I am going to put on a green dress and start dancing

Singing loudly boom boom boom, dancing soulfully, soulfully
Singing loudly boom boom boom, all together

Party for everybody – dance
Come on and dance
Come on and dance
Come on and
Party for everybody – dance
Come on and dance
Come on and dance
Come on and boom boom

The cat is happy, the dog is happy
The cat is happy, the dog is happy
We are in a wonderful mood and very happy
We are in a wonderful mood, oh joy

Singing loudly boom boom boom, dancing soulfully, ѕoulfully
Singing loudly boom boom boom, all together

Party for everybody – dance
Come on and dance
Come on and dance
Come on and
Party for everybody – dance
Come on and dance
Come on and dance
Come on and boom boom
