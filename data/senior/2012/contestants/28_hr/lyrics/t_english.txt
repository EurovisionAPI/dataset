Heaven

Listen to me when I tell you I've tried everything
You're still in my thoughts, I still feel you as mine
But I hear you're in love and people tell me you don't care
Me, like I've lost my mind, I still hope for you

But heaven pays everything back and remembers all debts
Each one of us dreams and heaven determines our path
Heaven pays everything back, someone up there sees it all
And these tears of mine will become your burden

But I hear you're in love and people tell me you don't care
Me, like I've lost my mind, I still hope for you

But heaven pays everything back and remembers all debts
Each one of us dreams and heaven determines our path
Heaven pays everything back, someone up there sees it all
And these tears of mine will become your burden

(All) hey, (all) all…
Heaven pays everything back (all, all)
Someone up there sees it all
Whoa… someone up there sees it all
All… all…

(Heaven pays everything back) Heaven pays everything back
(Someone up there sees it all)
(These tears of mine will become your burden)
Someone up there seeѕ it аll
