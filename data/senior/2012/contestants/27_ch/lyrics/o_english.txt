Unbreakable

You can do anything you want
It doesn't matter how hard it is
You can do it, you can do it

So please, don't mind, close your eyes
Take a trip outside your head
You can give me more

Swim against the stream
Following your wildest dream, your wildest dream
Swim against the stream
Following your wildest dream, your wildest dream
Swim against the stream
Following your wildest dream, your wildest dream

Don't stop rock, rock this place
Don't stop tryin', try your best
Don't stop, don't stop movin'

Today without a doubt, a good vibe is in the crowd
You can do it, you can do it, you can do it
Unbreakable, unbreakable
You can give me more

Swim against the stream
Following your wildest dream, your wildest dream
Swim against the stream
Following your wildest dream, your wildest dream
Swim against the stream
Following your wildest dream, your wildest dream

Unbreakable
Unbreakable

So please, don't mind, close your eyes
Take a trip outside your head

Unbreakable, unbreakable
Unbreakable, unbreakable
