Time

Time, time, don't let me down
You're the man in my playground
What you say I will obey night and day

Feel free to turn me on
Feel free to change my song
I will count and you will go on sing my song

I say
(Zman-man, ten li rak siman man, ten li et hazman)
(Lama lokhets alay? Tishan)
You got to give me more time
(Zman-man, lama lo tishan-shan? Tagid li kama zman)
(Lama lihyot shakhor lavan?)

Time, time, could you be mine?
I will feed you songs and wine
I'll make you lazy, I'll make you late
Wait, wait, wait

Wait, wait, we two are one
But you always take the lead
I lay down and you just run
Mind your speed

I say
(Zman-man, ten li rak siman man, ten li et hazman)
(Lama lokhets alay? Tishan)
You got to give me more time
(Zman-man, lama lo tishan-shan? Tagid li kama zman)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme time
(Lama lihyot shakhor lavan?)
You don't know what we talk about

(Zman… zman…)

(Zman-man, ten li rak siman man, ten li et hazman)
(Lama lihyot ѕhakhor lavаn?)

Time, time, don't let me down
