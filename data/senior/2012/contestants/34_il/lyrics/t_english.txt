Time

Time, time, don't let me down
You're the man in my playground
What you say I will obey night and day

Feel free to turn me on
Feel free to change my song
I will count and you will go on sing my song

I say
(Time, time, just give me a sign, sign, give me the time)
(Why are you pressuring me? Go to sleep)
You got to give me more time
(Time, time, why won't you sleep, sleep? Tell me how much time)
(Why should we be black and white?)

Time, time, could you be mine?
I will feed you songs and wine
I'll make you lazy, I'll make you late
Wait, wait, wait

Wait, wait, we two are one
But you always take the lead
I lay down and you just run
Mind your speed

I say
(Time, time, just give me a sign, sign, give me the time)
(Why are you pressuring me? Go to sleep)
You got to give me more time
(Time, time, why won't you sleep, sleep? Tell me how much time)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme time
(Why should we be black and white?)
You don't know what we talk about

(Time… time…)

(Time, time, just give me a sign, sign, give me the time)
(Why ѕhould we be black аnd white?)

Time, time, don't let me down
