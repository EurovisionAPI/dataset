Aphrodisiac

I gotta say what's on my mind
When I'm with you, I feel alright
You call me baby, we spend the night
I'm so addicted, I feel alive

Over and over I'm falling

Oh oh oh… oh, oh oh oh… oh
You make me dance, dance like a maniac
Oh oh oh… oh, oh oh oh… oh
You make me want your aphrodisiac

You make me want your aphrodisiac

I think about you all the time
I just can't get you off my mind
You drive me crazy, you drive me wild
You're so addictive, there's no way out

Oh oh oh… oh, oh oh oh… oh
You make me dance, dance like a maniac
Oh oh oh… oh, oh oh oh… oh
You make me want your aphrodisiac

You make me want your aphrodisiac

I'm craving for your touch
I want it way too much
I'm craving for your touch
Too much, your touch, too much

Over and over I'm falling

Oh oh oh… oh, oh oh oh… oh
You make me dance, dance like a maniac
Oh oh oh… oh, oh oh oh… oh
You make me want your aphrodisiac

Oh oh oh… oh, oh oh oh… oh
You make me dance, dance like a maniac
Oh oh oh… oh, oh oh oh… oh
You make me want your aphrodisiac

You make me want your aphrodiѕiаc
