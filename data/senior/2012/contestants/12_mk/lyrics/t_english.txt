Black and white

Look into my eyes now
I'm not a loser, you know
I don't give in until the end
There is no birth without falling

Open your soul and admit to me
What we are now, you and me
Half of me is in you
And half of you is sleeping in me
Come on and hug me, raise me to the heavens

Everything is black and white
One truth and one lie
And when we are together
I choose happiness, you choose sorrow
Everything is black and white
Nothing separates good and bad
Come on and smile
The day is leading me to the white nights

Look into my eyes now
You will find everything there
Come on, give yourself to the end
For a new rebirth with me

Open your soul and admit to me
What we are now, you and me
Half of me is in you
And half of you is sleeping in me
Come on and hug me, raise me to the heavens

Everything is black and white
One truth and one lie
And when we are together
I choose happiness, you choose sorrow
Everything is black and white
Nothing separates good and bad
Come on and smile
The day is leading you to the white nights

Everything is black and white
One truth and one lie
And when we are together
I choose happiness, you choose sorrow

Everything is black and white
Nothing separates good and bad
Come on and smile
The day is leading me to the white nights
Everything iѕ black аnd white
