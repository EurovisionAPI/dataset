Should've known better

Should've known better
Now I miss you like Sahara misses rain
Changing like the weather
Maybe it's true, maybe you're not gonna change

I feel like you have two homes
Yet I feel you are homeless
Where we live I feel like a stranger
When you home I feel even stranger

I live in no man's land
With no way home, like you don't understand
'Cause you so here, you so there, not really anywhere
She said…

Should've known better
Now I miss you like Sahara misses rain
Changing like the weather
Maybe it's true, maybe you're not gonna change

Feels like I'm always living out of my suitcase
What about all the years in between
Just trying to find my place

I live in no man's land
With no way home, like you don't understand
'Cause you so here, you so there, not really anywhere
She said: shout Insha'Allah, shout Insha'Allah, shout Insha'Allah
She said: shout Insha'Allah, shout Insha'Allah, shout Insha'Allah

We could've written words on a mountain high
Reminding ourselves to keep climbing, right
Sometimes we have to lose
A part of us to find the truth

Nothing more beautiful than the way
You used to breathe me into your lungs and soul
Sometimes we have to say: "I'm sorry, I can't stay"

Should've known better
Now I miss you like Sahara misses rain
Changing like the weather
Maybe it's true, maybe it's true

(Shout Insha'Allah, shout Insha'Allah, shout Insha'Allah)
Oh, should've known better
Now I miss you like Sahara misses rain
(Shout Insha'Allah, shout Insha'Allah, shout Insha'Allah)
Changing like the weather
Maybe it'ѕ true, maybe we're not gonna chаnge

Should've known better
