La la love

Lala… lala lala lalala… lala lala lala love
Lala… lala lala lalala… lala lalala love

Love the way you fill me up with life
Baby, we can break the speed of light
Nothing to fear when you are near
Just gimme more

Reaching for the sky, I'm aiming high
Close my eyes and then it's almost like you fly
Up in the air, let's take it there
Never let go

Oh… feel the energy between you and me, baby it's so right
Oh… I feel the energy just taking over me, over me

How I've been waiting for this
Lala… lala lala lalala… lala lala lala love
Oh I've been waiting for this
Lala… lala lala lalala… lala lala lala love

From Paris to LA over the night
All around the world, just you and I
Nothing to fear, when you are near
We're on a roll

And we do it again
No stop, no end
Out of control

Oh… feel the energy between you and me, baby it's so right
Oh… I feel the energy just taking over me, over me

How I've been waiting for this
Lala… lala lala lalala… lala lala lala love
Oh I've been waiting for this
Lala… lala lala lalala… lala lala lala love

Nothing to fear, when you are near

Oh… I feel the energy between you and me, baby it's so right
Oh… I feel the energy just taking over me, over me

How I've been waiting for this
Lala… lala lala lalala… lala lala lala love
Lala… lala lala lalala… lala lala lala love
Oh I've been waiting for thiѕ
Lala… lala lala lalala… lala lala lalа love
