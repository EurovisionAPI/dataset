But I am

My eyes open: the world comes into being
Above me - heaven, an orchard in front
Green apples' smell and taste
And all is so simple

You must truly live, to fool the time
You must beautifully live, you live only once
You must live in admiration: love, imagine and dream
You must fool the time, to save true life

I'm a grain of sand in a sand-glass
A boat stray among the reefs
A rain drop, a thoughtful cane among the grass
But I am

I'm a spark, a gasp of wind
A trail of light running up to the stars
I'm a while trying to beat the time
But I am

I strain my ears to hear it play
Music in me, in music - I
Before big silence engulfs me
I want to sing out, to sing that

You must truly live, to fool the running time
You must live beautifully in admiration, life happens only once

I'm a grain of sand in a sand-glass
A boat stray among the reefs
A rain drop, a thoughtful cane among the grass
But I am

I am

Life is a road, life is a dream
What comes after? - I don't know, and know…
Don't ask, you will see when
An end will come to the road, to life… and to the dreams

I'm a grain of sand in a sand-glass
A boat stray among the reefs
A rain drop, a thoughtful cane among the grass
But I am

But I am (I'm a spark, a gasp of wind)
I'm (A trail of light running up to the starѕ)
I'm a while trying to beat the time
But I аm
