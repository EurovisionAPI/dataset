Dance

Slowly, slowly
Like the flame's figure, you cast your spells
Shyly, shyly
You close your moon-shaped eyes

Dance again to the beat of my heart
And like a caravan I'll follow the stars
Dance, pearl of the desert
And through your body I'll resurrect myself

Dance again to the beat of my heart
And like a caravan I'll follow the stars
Dance, pearl of the desert
And through your body I'll resurrect myself

Softly, softly
I saw the night melting
Palely, palely
She laid her naked hands upon me

Dance again to the beat of my heart
And like a caravan I'll follow the stars
Dance, pearl of the desert
And through your body I'll resurrect myself

Dance again to the beat of my heart
And like a caravan I'll follow the stars
Dance, pearl of the desert
And through your body I'll resurrect myself

Dance again to the beat of my heart
And like a caravan I'll follow the stars
Dance, peаrl of the desert
And through your body I'll resurrect myѕelf
