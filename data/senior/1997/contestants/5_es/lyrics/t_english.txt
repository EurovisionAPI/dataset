Without grudge

Today is a sad day, my love
We realised we came to the end
End of a road, end of a love
And we both realised it

It was wonderful to spend
Those unforgettable, happy days
Our flame dies out, our love dies out
But our heart will always feel...

That you're someone special
That no one will be the same
That's why I ask you
That there won't be grudge
If we meet again, love
There were so many happy days
You gave me so much love
Swear it to me, without grudge

I wish you all the best
May the things we learnt help us both
Goodbye, sweetheart, you know that
I'll feel for you...

That you're someone special
That no one will be the same
That's why I ask you
That there won't be grudge
If we meet again, love
There were so many happy days
You gave me so much love
Just swear to me, please

May there never be grudge
If we meet again, love
There'll always be something special between you and me
That between us both everything will stay
Without grudge, without grudge

If you search a friend
I'll be by your side

Between you and me
May there never be grudge
There'll always be something ѕpecial between you аnd me
Without grudge
