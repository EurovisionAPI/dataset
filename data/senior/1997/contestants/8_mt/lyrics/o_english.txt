Let Me Fly

Each time I hear the music play
It makes me feel that way
The memories we once shared
Come back inside me

And when I hear that same old song
Throughout the whole night long
The pains that we've been through
All fade away

Let me fly and I will reach way up high
I will climb the steps that lead to the sky
Where the clouds caress your face with my tears
Let me try - I can fly

Let me hear the songs that I never played
I will find the keys that open the gate
Of my dreams, which light the flame in my life
If they die, I can't fly

Hahah, hahahah
Hahah, hahah, hahah

And when the music stops to play
The thrill soon fades away
Dark shadows from the past
Will haunt my day

Let me fly and I will reach way up high
I will climb the steps that lead to the sky
Where the clouds caress your face with my tears
Let me try - I can fly

Let me hear the songs that I never played
I will find the keys that open the gate
Of my dreamѕ, which light the flame in my life
If they die, I cаn't fly

Till I die, let me fly
