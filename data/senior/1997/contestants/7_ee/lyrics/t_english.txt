Forbidden land

Why do you always hide yourself in yesterday
When you disappear there you'll stay disappeared
Finding you for the hundredth time already
The flaws between us have become cracks, I see
But if I give up, you'll be lost for good

On this forbidden land I feel myself again
I'm looking for you and again there's a border between us
This forbidden land hides you from me like fog
Sometime it will disappear from our way

When I can't find you
And while looking even a day falls short
You may lie down next to me
You won't recognise me, won't hear, won't see
Still I understand you
You linger in yesterday again

On this forbidden land I feel myself again
I'm looking for you and again there's a border between us
This forbidden land hides you from me like fog
Sometime it will disappear from our way

I'll bring you from the forbidden land
I promise you, I will fetch you

(This forbidden land, I feel myself again)
From the forbidden land
(I'm looking for you and again there's a border between us)
Forbidden land (This forbidden land)
Can't keep you (Can't keep you forever)
The forbidden land will vаnish from between uѕ
