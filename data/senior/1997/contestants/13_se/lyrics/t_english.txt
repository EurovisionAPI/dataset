If only she loves me

I see a girl dance through the night
Smiling so all the hearts stop
Even though I walked through fire and water
She touches me like nobody else
And if she falls for me everything will change
For she'll see that the man she waited for
It is me, it could be she and I

If only she loves me
I'll have the angel the whole of heaven looks for
And the only woman I want to have again
If only she loves me
I become that man she sees in her dreams
All the others have lost
She can never love without me

I don't dare to meet her looks
Show that my heart is on fire
How will I ever catch this girl
Ask before she disappears
Even though other men could die for the her sake
I understand what nobody sees
What she wants, it is only me

If only she loves me
I'll have the angel the whole of heaven looks for
And the only woman I want to have again
If only she loves me
I become that man she sees in her dreams
All the others have lost
She can never love without me

I've nothing left to live for
Nothing is worth anything unless we find each other
We become one

If only she loves me
I'll have the angel the whole of heaven looks for
And the only woman I want to have again
If only she loves me
I become that man she sees in her dreams
All the others have lost
She can never love without…

If only she loves me
I become that man she sees in her dreamѕ
She cаn never love without me
