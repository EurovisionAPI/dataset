San Francisco

It still feels like yesterday
When everyone was singing: "Make love, not war "
And the world had longer hair
It feels like yesterday

Being brothers and sisters was in
California dreamin' 
Important questions and an open mind
The answers were blowin' in the wind' 

Oh… time for love in San Francisco
A dream of peace, a spring of youth
No guns, no war, no disco 
Just lovely flowers in your hair

When everybody surfed on a good vibration
USA got their man on the moon 
Jimi Hendrix played fire and passion
At Woodstock for a new generation

Yeah… then there was a strong feeling to be young and free
Life had plenty of time
And the whole world had longer hair
It feels like yesterday

Yeah yeah… time for love in San Francisco
A dream of peace, a spring of youth
Ooh yeah… no guns, no war, no disco 
Just lovely flowers in your hair

All over the earth Lennon's song was heard:
"Love, love, love" 
With the message that love sets everyone free
If we don't let it pass us by

Time for love in San Fran…
Time for love in San Francisco
A dream of peace, a spring of youth
Ooh yeah… no guns, no war, no disco 
Just lovely flowers in your…
Just lovely flowerѕ in you hair
Oh yeаh…
