My final dance

London, Paris, Rome, became empty words
I walked the wide and golden road, blinded by love
False acquaintances, revolved around me alone
I had some caviar, it's all too late now

For I take my final dance
And bid my life farewell in style
Yet I never regret a thing, never regret

Crystal champagne, pearls, porcelain
Diamonds for dinner, love for dessert
If I love today, it will be in the papers tomorrow
I take a bubblebath, drown my sorrows

And I take my final dance
And that's how I bid my life farewell in style
Yet I never regret a thing, never regret

All that I get today, has gone away tomorrow

So I take my final dance
And that's how I bid my life farewell in ѕtyle
Yet I never regret а thing, never regret
