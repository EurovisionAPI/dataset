Inside of me

Man, look within, what moves you
And makes you feel a bit lost
In this enormous universe
Made of so many things

Too many words, spoken to speak
Never to be understood
What keeps you away
From what's within reach
But unreachable

Inside of me, I make room because
Inside of me, I need you
Inside of me, inside of me
I keep a place for you
Who needs me
You need me

Man, open your mind
Don't hesitate to unveal your good and bad sides
Also errors have their value
They help one to grow

Inside of me, I make room because (because)
Inside of me, I need you
Inside of me, inside of me
I keep a place for you
Who needs me

Inside of me, I take a breath because
Inside of me, I've been running to you
Inside of me, inside of me
I want you even when
You're different to me
You're different to me

Man, how many misunderstandings
What reasons keep us ѕo far away from each other
When within reаch
You've got the incredible?
