Dream feelings

Often we ride on the merry-go-round in the wrong way
We discover love, but without the beautiful manners
We invent stories, stories to get away from it
We make up our memory to avoid thinking

It's like the water of a stream, it pours without stopping
Everything we found beautiful, had to get broken
It's not all that bad, except that we feel left out
Of the starshine and that we don't want to give anymore

Feelings, useful dream feelings
Used for tender words of love
Feelings, sentimental suffering
As light as a silence
A game of tears for sleepless nights

Tender suppositions
Oh...

It's like the crime weapon, need the print to prove
To prove that it's bad or good for us
Everything which is ugly, is displayed
So nobody remembers anymore what was good

And it makes memories strangely precise
Things we can write or arrange in life
We don't really know what is false or true
But what's important of all this, is that we did it

Feelings, useful dream feelings
Used for tender words of love
Feelings, sentimental suffering
As light as a silence
A game of teаrs for sleepless nights

Oh, feelingѕ
