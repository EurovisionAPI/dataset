Goodbye

Calm me down with pictures from good movies
Brave me with a line from good songs
I can't see, my eye's devoid of shine
I only hear the two words, which mean it's over

Goodbye,  oh oh oh oh oh… goodbye love
Goodbye,  oh oh oh oh oh… goodbye love
Goodbye 

Look for me in your memories
Find me in the dawn of a new day
But please don't sigh falsely
Don't say the two words which mean it's over

Goodbye,  oh oh oh oh oh… goodbye love
Goodbye,  oh oh oh oh oh… goodbye love
Goodbye 

I can't see, my eye's devoid of shine
Oh… I only hear the two words which meаn it'ѕ over

Goodbye,  oh oh oh oh oh… goodbye love
Goodbye,  oh oh oh oh oh… goodbye love
Goodbye,  oh oh oh oh oh… goodbye love
Goodbye,  oh oh oh oh oh… goodbye love
Goodbye
