Time

Sometimes time ran through my fingers
And sometimes it just wouldn't go by
But time heals many wounds
And often, in difficult moments
I wished that I could turn back time, because

Time, time, where does the time go?
Time, time, when is it the right time?
Who knows what'll happen next?
Who knows where the road will lead us?
Tell me, where are you?

Time, time, what else will happen during this time
To me?

I prayed for a bit of luck
And cried for the times gone by
But there was one question
Which no one here was able to answer:
Can we live happily in peace? – No

Time, time, where does the time go?
Time, time, when is it the right time?
Where will I be tomorrow?
In the end, will I be alone?
And where are you?

(Time, time, where does the time go?)
How quickly time goes by
(Time, time, when is it the right time?)
How quickly the wind turns
Who knows what'll happen next?
Who knows where the road will lead us?
Tell me, where are you?

Time, time, even if the road is long
All I need iѕ а little time
