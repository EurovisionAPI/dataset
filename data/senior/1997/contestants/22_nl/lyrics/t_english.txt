No one has time anymore

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh…
Ooh ooh ooh…

Where do you have to go with all your questions
When no one wants to listen?
What do you do with your empty days?
You'd rather stop the time for a moment

Until you've found someone
Who has ten minutes for you
Well, it can take a long time
You wish you're still alive by then

Because no one has time anymore
Only the time to hurry up
No, no one has time anymore
Only to think about himself
No, no, no one has time anymore
No one has time anymore

You don't understand anything of the world
The time is expensive, because time is money
Standing still is out of the question
So tempo, that's what matters

Although the people are still giving
They don't linger over their feelings
By computer they can quickly
Deposit something for the good cause

Because no one has time anymore
Only the time to hurry up
No, no one has time anymore
Only to think about himself
No, no, no one has time anymore
No one has time anymore

No one has time anymore
No one has time anymore
No one has time anymore
No one, no, no

Will we ever realise
There's much more than the factor time?
Stand still for a moment, give in to the temptation
To have some more sensitivity

Because no one has time anymore
Only the time to hurry up
No, no one has time anymore
Only to think about himself
No, no, no one has time anymore

(No one has time anymore)
Only the time to hurry up
(No one has time anymore)
No, no one has time anymore
(No one has time anymore)
Only to think about himself
(No one, no, no)
No, no, no one has time anymore

(And I still have to do this)
(And I still have to do that)
(And I still have to do this way)
Only the time to hurry up
(And I still have to do that way)
No, no one has time anymore
Only to think about himself
No, no, no one haѕ time аnymore
