Wake up

Somewhere at the town's end, an old house sleeps
Behind the ninth window, a girl is awake
The golden moon is counting her tears
The night hides them, just like they're stars

By the empty table, every night she waits
Her pure spirit's calling out for help:
''Good fairies, where are those lips"
"That are magic when lovers kiss?''

Wake up, good prince
I would like to give you all
My dreams and my youth
Break the spell of the fairy tale

Wake up, good prince
I would like to give you all
My dreams and my youth
Break the spell of the fairy tale

Wake up, good prince
I would like to give you all
My dreams and my youth
Break the spell of the fairy tale

Wake up

A new morning, a morning dawning over tears
A heart sees, sees all that the eye cаn't ѕee
