One Step

The night casts a shadow and it's mine
Your pillow is untouched and I'm still here
Bad lovin' 
Bad man, bad lovin' (bad) 

There hasn't been much traffic on our highway
From today on I have the right of way
Because I don't want anymore
Not like this, that's not how I want it – just

One step forward  and two back
One step too far, babe, and I'll be gone
Love is no bounced cheque – bad man 

Oh… sex with you passes by as fast as spaceship Enterprise
At the speed of light you cool me down
Not like this, that's not how I want it – just

One step forward  and two back
One step too far, babe, and I'll be gone
Love ain't a bounced cheque – bad man 

Oh… one step forward  and two back
One step too far, babe, and I'll be gone
Love is no bounced cheque – bad man 
Bad man 

Not like this, that's not how I want it with you

Oh yeah…
(One step forward, two steps back) 
One step too far, babe, and I'll be gone
Love is no bounced cheque – bad man 

Love is no bounced cheque
(Bad man) Oh… 

(One step forward , two back)
One step forward  and two back
And two back, ow…
One ѕtep forward , bаck to me
