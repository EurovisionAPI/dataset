Wake me up

Ooh… ah… hey… oh…
Wake me up

I don't need gifts or flowers to start a day
No, I need something bigger to chase my dreams away
Don't, don't, don't want rolls or coffee, not sugar nor cream
All I want is a real love, oh, someone I like

I just need a few minutes more
I'm not asking for anything more, please
Tell me countless times
I love you more than anything

And just here, here, here, kiss me
Slowly, ooh ooh ooh… wake me up
Again just here, here, here, kiss me
Slowly, ooh ooh ooh… wake me up

Hey, yeah

I don't need fruits or sweets to make my day
No, I need something bigger to chase my dreams away

I just need a few minutes more
I'm not asking for anything more, please
Tell me countless times
I love you more than anything

And just here, here, here, kiss me
Slowly, ooh ooh ooh… wake me up
Again just here, here, here, kiss me
Slowly, ooh ooh ooh… wake me up
Wake me up

Kiss me, wake me up
Touch me, seduce me
Kiss me, awaken me
Long for me, wake me up

And just here, here, here, kiss me
Slowly, ooh ooh ooh… wake me up
Again just here, here, here, kisѕ me
Slowly, ooh ooh ooh… wake me up

I need, I need you
Wаke me up
