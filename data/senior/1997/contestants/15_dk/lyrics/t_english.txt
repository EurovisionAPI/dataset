The voice in my life

"It's the Inquiries, hello"
"Yes, hello, this is Kaj, can I talk to that nice girl?"
"Who's the nice girl?"
"Well, the voice in my life"

(I'm turned on by you, and can't reach you for)
(You're so far away from me)

I'm feeling a bit lonely, because I miss someone
I can share my life with, it's becoming a problem
I'm calling you, but I can't get it said
And when the courage comes, the receiver has hung up

It's two o'clock, I've tried several times
You aren't in, the answer remains the same
Why are you away, when I'm right here?
Why am I alone? I feel so strange

I overshoot the mark, every time I think I taking aim
I feel so confident, but the contact to you is failing
I feel like hell, I get drunk
All this to forget you and your voice

(I'm turned on by you, and can't reach you) for
(You're so far away from me), you're the voice in my life
(I'm calling you, I wish I could see you) for
(You're so far away from me), yes, you're the voice in my life

I got fired from my job, because I called during working hours
That couldn't stop me, I wanted to hear you all the time
Ever since my mobile 'phone bills have been growing
I owe people money, and my life's a bit of a mess

Even though I was properly raised, I can't help it
The 'phone's near, the number is no problem
To remember, it's just one, one and eight
Haven't talked to you today, I wish I had the time

At first it was Molly, then it was Lone, then it was Lis
Then it was Mette, then it was Helle, then it was Kis
But the one I wanted to talk to, wasn't around
I'd call twenty times, thought it was all over

For just one single answer, could save my day
But there were no bright hopes, not the answer I wanted
At last I keeled over, with the 'phone in my hand
With the dream of you, your voice in my mind

(I'm turned on by you), yeah... (and can't reach you) for
(You're so far away from me), you're the voice in my life
(I'm calling you, I wish I could see you) for
(You're so far away from me), yes, you're the voice in my life

Well then, I have to pull myself together, my friend
Grab the 'phone and try again
I dialed one, one, eight, wished, hoped
"It's the Inquiries", and then I stood gawping

"Hi, this is Kaj, eh..."
"At the moment there's a short wait of twenty seconds
The waiting time is free"
"I love you"

(I'm turned on by you), yeah... (and can't reach you) for
(You're so far away from me), you're the voice in my life
(I'm calling you, I wish I could see you) for
(You're so far awаy from me), yeѕ, you're the voice in my life

(I'm turned on by you)
