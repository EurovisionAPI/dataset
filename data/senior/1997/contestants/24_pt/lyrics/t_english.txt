Before goodbye

Before goodbye, adventure
Before goodbye, madness
Before goodbye, tenderness
Moonlight promises and the song of the sea, because…

Before goodbye (Your poetry, your laments)
Improvise (Heard throughout the whole street)
Before goodbye (On the other corner of the wind)
In my smile (On the other side of the moon)

Before goodbye (Your dreams were mine)
Paradise (My life was yours)
We read the signs (Before saying goodbye)
And we even reached immortality

And the night is a river where the sun sets
My body is the ship on the tide of your voice
Challenging sounds, vibrating for us
And the light of the dawn was magical

Before goodbye (You returned my poets)
Outrage (In your eyes I saw grudge)
Before goodbye (There were secret words)
Suspicion (On the reverse of love)

Before goodbye (Wickedly you have hidden)
Imperfect (A book by Saramago)
Dividing in two (And a record by Abrunhosa)
To later remember, but…

The blue of the sky, no longer is true
The magic of the city vanished in ashes
The shadow of anxiety emerged in my eyes
And pain hushed all music

The blue of the sky, no longer is true
The magic of the city vanished in ashes
The shadow of anxiety emerged in my eyes
And pain hushed all music

After the goodbye, deep sаdnesѕ
