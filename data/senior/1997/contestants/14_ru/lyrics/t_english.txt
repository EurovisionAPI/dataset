Prima donna

Like an injured bird with golden feathers
You go on stage
And I see, I see, that you are happy

Sing for me, just sing, Prima donna
Sing with an injured soul, Prima donna
Dying every time

Laugh into the face of your destiny, Prima donna
For you it isn't new, Prima donna
To play the terrible and easy part, to be a star

And with your tired glance that is crowned with tears
You look into this hall
And you probably see the dream that is just an illusion

Here it is, the last combat, Prima donna
The combat with your destiny, Prima donna

Laugh into the face of your destiny, Prima donna
For you it isn't new, Prima donna
To play the terrible and foolish part
To stay alone forever

Give me the force, oh heaven, to drain the cup
There, where nobody has ever been, she had already drunk the wine
They shouted 'Bravo' to her, for this strange farce
I'm raising my glasѕ to the grand final

Bravo! Prima donna! Brаvo!
