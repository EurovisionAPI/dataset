I wake up every night
I can't find anyone to pray
Somewhere in the light
Changing all up
I'm afraid on the side
Looking out for the lies to say
Someone has the light
Feeding our fire

I came to fight
I came to fight over you
Don't want your lies
Don't want your lies, I need truth
I came to fight
I came to fight over you
No one will try
No one will try if that's true

I won't wait for the sign
I can't find anyone to stay
But there's something in the light
Saving our lives

I came to fight
I came to fight over you
Don't want your lies
Don't want your lies, I need truth
I came to fight
I came to fight over you
No one will try
No one will try if that's true

And I can face you now
No, I won't break you down
If I can find you, I won't hide you
It's not what I do

I came to fight
I came to fight over you
Don't want your lies
Don't want your lies, I need truth
I came to fight
I came to fight over you
No one will try
No one will try if thаt'ѕ true
