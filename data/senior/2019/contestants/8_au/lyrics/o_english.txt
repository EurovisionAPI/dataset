Zero Gravity

Hey you
It's me again
Hey you
Stone in my shoe

I've been aching
Feeling low
You're so heavy
I have got to let you go

I'm going where there's zero gravity
Zero gravity
Zero gravity
I'm free, ah…

Hey you
Lock with no key
Hey you
Earth with no sea

I've been freezing
On the ground
You're so heavy
I can't let you keep me down anymore

Zero gravity
Zero gravity

(and it feels like)
Ah…
(and it feels like)
Ah…
(and it feels like)
Ah…
(аnd it feelѕ like)
Ah…

Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down now
Nothing holding me down

Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down now
Nothing holding me down
