Keep on Going

Go ahead,
walk a lot,
search, find, walk, walk,
somewhere someone is singing,
singing from the heart,
behind the barbed wire,
singing,
wounded,
but still singing

Vaarada varada, varada rada hee
Vaarada varada, varada rada hee
go,
and you will find,
the missed songs,
sing at the top of your voice,
to bring them your voice,

go ahead,
follow your heart,
wounds,
go,
cross that barbed wire,
sing varado,
fathers,
children,
set a chonguri,
we will not split up,

follow your heart and walk across the sea,
we heal each other's wounds with singing,

Vaarada varada, (vaarada varada)
Vaarada varada, varada rada heee (simarada varada)
Vaarada varada, varada radaaaa

follow your heart and walk across the sea
we heal eаch other's wounds with ѕinging
