Hate will prevail

The revelry was unrestrained
The hangover is endless
Life is meaningless
The emptiness will get us all

Hate will prevail
Happiness will end
For it is an illusion
A treacherous pipe dream

<i style="color:#789">All that I saw
Tears ran down
All that I gave
Once gave
I gave it all to you</i>

Multilateral delusions
Unilateral punishments
Gullible poor fellows
The escape will end
The emptiness will get us all

Hate will prevail
Europe will crumble
Web of lies
Arises from the ashes
United as one

<i style="color:#789">All that I saw
Tears ran down
All that I gave
Once gave
I gave it all to you</i>

<i style="color:#789">All that I saw
Tears ran down
All that I gave
Once gave
I gave it all to you</i>

<i style="color:#789">I gave it all to you
I gave it all to you</i>
Hate will prevail
Love will die
<i style="color:#789">I gave it all to you</i>
Hate will prevail
Happiness will end
<i style="color:#789">I gave it all to you</i>
For it is an illusion
A treacherouѕ pipe dream

Hate will prevаil
