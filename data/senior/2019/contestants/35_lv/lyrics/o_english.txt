That Night

It was a lonely night
No stars were shining, there was no light
One troubled thought broke through
And colored my world so blue

Love… where are you?
Love… I need you
Love… all night through
Where are you my love? Oh

I travelled through the time
It felt for me like doing a crime
My mind did crazy things
Imagination opened their wings

A river dark as cold
It took me far away from the shore
Please come to me till sunrise
And take me back to my paradiѕe

Love… where are you?
Love… I need you
Love… all night through
Where are you my love? Oh

Love… where are you?
Love… I need you
Love… all night through
Where are you my love? Oh

Love, love
Love… where are you?
Love… I need you
Love… all night through
Where are you my love? Oh

Love… where are you?
Love… I need you
Love… all night through
Where are you my love? Where аre you?
