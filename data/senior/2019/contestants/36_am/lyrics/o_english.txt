Who are you?
What you really do?
When you have to fight the agony that's aiming back at you?
Who are you?
Who you run to?
Depend, defend, hope on
Can you function on your own?

Are you from those who will swallow down
The pain, disgrace, the sadness? Yeah
When the one you love so much
Can take your soul and break it, no

Wait for, oh, wait for
What I waited for?
Wait for, oh, wait for
Oh, no, I'm done

Walking out, ooh-ooh
Whatever I've built I'm gonna burn down
I'm walking out, ooh-ooh
You're no more a king 'cause I was your crown

First you said you would die for me
But in the end I was the one bleeding all alone
First you said, you kneeled, you swore
You loved, you lived for me
How could you forget it all?

Are you from those who can take a loving heart
And squeeze it out of love?
Then prepare to slowly get
Not loved but hated instead

Walking out, ooh-ooh
Whatever I've built I'm gonna burn down
I'm walking out, ooh-ooh
You're no more a king 'cause I was your crown
Walking out, walking out (Walking out, walking out)
No crying now
Walking out, walking out (Walking out, walking out)
No begging
Walking out, ooh-ooh
At last, I feel proud
I'm walking out

You knew that my heart wasn't small
But somehow you came and filled it all

(Walking out, ooh-ooh)
(Whatever I've built I'm gonna burn down) Yeah
(I'm walking out, ooh-ooh) Yeah
(You're no more a king 'cause I was your crown)
(Walking out, walking out) Walking out, walking out
Crying now
(Walking out, walking out) Walking out, walking out
Begging, yeah
(Walking out, ooh-ooh)
(At laѕt, I feel proud)
I'm wаlking out
