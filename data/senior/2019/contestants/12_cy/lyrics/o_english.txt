You've got a problem, 2 AM I'm in your head
Let's just be honest tonight
Only I can solve it
You're twisting, turning in your bed
Them sheets need my body tonight

That's when you call me, that's when you call me
Say you're feeling lonely
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Time is moving slowly
We keep it undercover
I know you miss the taste
Heart beats like an 808

You need my love on replay
Replay, replay, replay, yeah
You need my love on replay
Replay, replay, replay, yeah

You're stuck on me darlin'
Like a love song on repeat
Yeah, you've got a problem, alright
And I know I'm the one to blame
Because I make you scream my name
And baby, I'm all in tonight

That's when you call me, that's when you call me
Say you're feeling lonely
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Time is moving slowly
We keep it undercover
I know you miss the taste
Heart beats like an 808

You need my love on replay
Replay, replay, replay, yeah
You need my love on replay
Replay, replay, replay, yeah

And I know I'm the one to blame
'Cause I make you scream my name
Baby, I'm all in tonight
That's when you call me, that's when you call me

That's when you call me, that's when you call me
Say you're feeling lonely
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Time is moving slowly
We keep it undercover
I know you miss the taste
Heart beatѕ like an 808
