Love is Forever

Travel the world to see
The ruins of what has been
Learning our history
But still, we don't take it in

Why we make it tough, the world has had enough
Don't get too political
And who are we to judge? It doesn't take too much
Only just a miracle

Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Just a taste of love, a taste of what
Could actually rule both me and you
A taste of love is all we got
So don't you never ever give up love

Come over my long lost friend
And work on a happy end
Imagine what we could do
After what we've been through

Why we make it tough, the world has had enough
Don't get too political
And who are we to judge? It doesn't take too much
Only just a miracle

Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Just a taste of love, a taste of what
Could actually rule both me and you
A taste of love is all we got
So don't you never ever give up love

Come discover life
Tonight we're all setting off
Our days in the sun are not over
What do you think, my friend?

Why should we fight? All we need is love
Love is for everyone
Love is hope, everyone can understand
Love is the same language

Love is forever
Love is forever and for everyone
Love is forever
Love is forever and for everyone
Just a taste of love, a taste of what
Could actually rule both me and you
A taste of love iѕ аll we got
So don't you never ever give up love
