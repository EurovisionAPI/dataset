Heaven

Life, life was once so lonely
Heartbreak was the only thing you left for me
My life, my life was so empty
And love was the furthest, furthest thing from me

Falling, I'm in Heaven, falling
I'm in Heaven, falling, straight into your heart
Falling, I'll catch you while you're falling
I hear your heart calling into my arms
Falling, I'm in Heaven, falling
I'm in Heaven, falling, straight into your heart
Falling, I'll catch you while you're falling
I hear your heart calling into my arms
I'm in Heaven

There's no place I'd rather be
As the candle glow flees, but with you right here

I got used to feeling naked
Walking blind with hanging heart (With hanging heart)
I was ready to give up
Now you came into my life

Falling
Falling, I'm in Heaven, falling
I'm in Heaven, falling, straight into your heart
I'll catch you while you're falling
I'll catch you while you're falling
I hear your heart calling into my arms (Into my arms)
Falling, I'm in Heaven, falling (I'm in heaven)
I'm in Heaven, falling, straight into your heart (Straight into your heart)
Falling, I'll catch you while you're falling
I hear your heart calling into my armѕ
I'm in Heaven

I'm in Heaven
