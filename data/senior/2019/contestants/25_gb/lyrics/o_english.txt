Bigger Than Us

Hear these words that I sing to you
I will make it clear, it's me and you
We can have this love that we'll never lose
It's bigger than us

Take my hand and I'll lead you home
Can you understand? You will never be alone

It's bigger than us
It's bigger than you and me
It's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything we see
'Cause I can feel the universe
When I'm feeling you breathe
It's bigger than us
And it's bigger than you and me
It's bigger

I won't give up and I won't let go
'Cause this kind of love is gonna be our only hope

(It's bigger than us)
It's bigger than you and me
It's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything we see
'Cause I can feel the universe
When I'm feeling you breathe
It's bigger than us
And it's bigger than you and me
It's bigger

(Bigger), bigger, (bigger), bigger

This kind of love
Is bigger than everything we see, yeah

Oh, oh oh
So much bigger, yeah

It's bigger than us
(It's bigger than you and me)
(It's bigger than us)
It's bigger than everything we see
'Cause I can feel the universe
When I'm feeling you breathe
It's bigger than us
And it's bigger than you and me
