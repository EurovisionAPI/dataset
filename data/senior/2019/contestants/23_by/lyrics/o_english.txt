Like It

I guess I forgotten to turn my phone
Off I'm outside my comfort zone
I'm tired of being lonely, tam-tara-ram
Nobody gonna like this, no
Okay, I don't like these empty words
I'll go even if it really hurts
It's making me stronger, tam-tara-ram
I know it's gonna be

Uuh, what should I do?
It's up to you, karma
Uuh, I wish I knew
Give me a sign, karma
Just to remind you
I don't give up (Give up)
I won't give up, no
I'll always try

Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it (Let me in your heart)
Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it, Let's break the rules
Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it (I'll share what I've got)
Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it, baby, repeat my moves

It feels crazy and a little wild
I know what is wrong and what is right
It's making me wiser, tam-tara-ram
The universe is ours now
Okay, put your favourite sneakers on
And show your emotions on the floor
Add hashtag to find ya, tam-tara-ram
I know it's gonna be

Uuh, what should I do?
It's up to you, karma
Uuh, I wish I knew
Give me a sign, karma
Just to remind you
I don't give up
I won't give up, no
I'll always try

Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it (Let me in your heart)
Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it, Let's break the rules
Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it (I'll share what I've got)
Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it, baby, repeat my moves

Heya, give me fly, give me fly, give me fly
Heya, like it too, like it too, like it too, baby

I feel the flow of energy
I should let go mistakes of me
I feel the flow of energy

You go with me, baby

Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it
Let me in your heart
Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it
Let's break the rules
Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it, I'll share what I've got
I'll share what I've got
Yes, you're gonna like it
Yes, you're gonna like it
Baby, repeаt my moveѕ
