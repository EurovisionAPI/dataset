Stay

Hold on
Even with the wind we'll make it
Be strong
Keep the fire burning inside
Go on as I breathe in you
Look into my eyes
Fly me high
Right up in the sky

Stay
Until I find a way to be together
Forever's here to stay
No matter what they say
It's now or never
It's forever

This time
We can try to keep our story
This crime
We can stop from breaking apart
No rhyme
Is a match for you

Never let me down
If I fall
I'm nothing at all

Stay
Until I find a way to be together
Forever's here to stay
No matter what they say
It's now or never
It's forever

When you come stand beside me
The earth is moving fast

Stay
Stay
Oh …
Oh …
Stay, stay
Oh …
Oh

Stay
Until I find a way to be together
Forever's here to stay
No matter what they sаy
It's now or never
It'ѕ forever
