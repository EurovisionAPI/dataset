Mind's got to move, but I'm so trapped within me
Expanded all my limits too carelessly
I'm counting on the time to get me back in line
'Cause nothing really makes sense no more
And I'm set on hold, so I needn't be bold anymore

'Cause the face in the mirror
Just couldn't look clearer right back through me
And how I'd like to say
It will be better tomorrow or any day

Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, you
You and the luck you're trying to find
You, you
You and how hard you try to hide it

I sense the pain, but it doesn't hurt anymore
It's even number than the ache I felt before
So I smile for a while, let the torture begin and
The pressure on my chest becomes almost routine, oh
It's not like I don't care, but there's nothing left to bare

Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, you
You and the love you're trying to find
You, you
You and how hard you try to hide it

And I'm letting it all come crashing down
Come breaking in
It's like the rain just left back blurred outlineѕ

And I'm talking 'bout you, you
You and the love you're trying to find
You, you
You and how hаrd you try to hide it
