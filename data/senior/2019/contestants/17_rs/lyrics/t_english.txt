Crown

Your dear eyes
Are the only thing that calms me down
Oh, I love you so

The night is long
It is sad without you
Give me your hand
And never let go

Everything for you
I give myself to you

Let the world hear me now
I'm guarding you with my life
Let them all see us now
Let everyone know that, forever
I am yours

The crown is yours
My love
I want you to know
That it belongs to you

Everything for you
I give myself to you

Let the world hear me now
I'm guarding you with my life
Let them all see us now
Let everyone know that, forever
I am yourѕ

Let everyone know thаt, forever
I love you
