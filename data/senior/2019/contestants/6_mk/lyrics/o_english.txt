Proud

Girl, they will try to tell you what to do
How to look, smile, act and move
All the rules are made for you to lose
But baby let me tell you something

Girl, for every tear the world makes you cry
Hold on to me, I am always on your side
Don't be afraid to spread your wings and fly

Tell them
Raise your voice and say it loudly
Show them
What it means to stand up proudly
Tell them
This is me and thanks to you I'm proud
Go on now, tell them
Raise your voice and say it loudly
Show them
What it means to stand up proudly
Tell them
This is me and thanks to you I'm proud, I'm proud, I'm proud

Girl, they will try to tell you what to do
Have no fear, the power lies in you
Shine your light, go and break the rules

Go on now, tell them
Raise your voice and say it loudly
Show them
What it means to stand up proudly
Tell them
This is me and thanks to you I'm proud, I'm proud, I'm proud
Go on now, tell them
Raise your voice and say it loudly
Show them
What it means to stand up proudly
Tell them
This is me and thаnkѕ to you I'm proud

Girl
