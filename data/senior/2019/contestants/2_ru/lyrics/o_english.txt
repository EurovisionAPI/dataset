Scream

No I can't stay here longer
You cannot make me cry
So, I will leave you to wonder
What will become of our lives

I'll swallow hard
Fall apart
Break and bleed but
You won't see

Tears won't fall
While pride stands tall
Maybe they can't be heard or seen
But tears aren't quiet things

They scream
They scream
They scream

Though my throat is on fire
My eyes will be liars
And they'll try to stay drier
Until you turn away

I'll swallow hard
Fall apart
Break and bleed but
You won't see

Tears will fall
I hear them all

They scream
They scream

Not so silent and innocent
Acid rain from your finger prints
Echoes rivers of loneliness
Hitting the walls of my heart

They scream
