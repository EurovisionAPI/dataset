Say Na Na Na

Na-na-na-na-na-na…

You look sad and lonely
Is something wrong tonight?
Why this rush to run away?
Things will be alright
Just be strong and look at me
Hear me when I say
Who cares that you're outta love?
It happens every day

All your dreams have gone away
No matter what you do
Love all colours of this life
And to yourself be true
Don't forget my number
Call me anytime
I will always tell you life is beautiful and fine

Say na na na
On a dark deserted way, say na na na
There's a light for you that waits, it's na na na
Say na na na, say na na na
You're not alone, so stand up, na na na
Be a hero, be the rainbow, and say na na na
Say na na na

Na-na-na-na-na-na…

All your dreams have gone away
No matter what you do
Love all colours of this life
And to yourself, be true
Don't forget my number
Call me anytime
I will always tell you life is beautiful and fine (Na na na)

Say na na na
On a dark deserted way, say na na na
There's a light for you that waits, it's na na na
Say na na na, say na na na
You're not alone, so stand up, na na na
Be a hero, be the rainbow, and say na na na
Say na na na

If you're feeling lonely
We can take it slowly
Think I'm going crazy
Yes, I'm going crazy
We can all go crazy
Bir İki Üç

Say na na na
On a dark deserted way, say na na na
There's a light for you that waits, it's na na na
Say na na na, say na na na
You're not alone, so stand up, na na na
Be a hero, be the rainbow, and ѕay na na na
Say na na nа
