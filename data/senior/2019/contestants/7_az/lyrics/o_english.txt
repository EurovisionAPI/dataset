Truth

I'm in the mirror
So freaking bitter
But I've gotta get through
I've gotta get through
Keep it together
Be cool under pressure
'Cause she wants to break you
She wants to break you

Drink 'till I forget
She's on to the next
And when the ghosts start screaming
Right when they resonate
Hear my heart confess

It's been so hard to bear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it
It's just too hard to hear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it

Oh oh ohh…
Shut up, shut up about it

Out of the mirror
It's getting clearer
But then out of the blue
She crashes the room
Gotta remember
She is a killer
With that freaking perfume
Girl, it's too soon

It's been so hard to bear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it
It's just too hard to hear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it

Oh oh ohh…
Shut up, shut up about it
Oh oh ohh…
Shut up, shut up about it

I don't need, I don't need the truth
I don't need, I don't need the truth

It's been so hard to bear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it
It's just too hard to hear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it

Oh oh ohh…
Shut up, shut up about it
Oh oh ohh…
Shut up, ѕhut up аbout it
