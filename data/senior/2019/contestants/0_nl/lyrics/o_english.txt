Arcade

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home

I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end before it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a loѕing gаme
