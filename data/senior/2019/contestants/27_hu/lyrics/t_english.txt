My father

My father raised me like the wind
Blowing softly, singing, telling fairy tales
He lived where every road ended
One thousand and one years aren't enough for a life, for a life

I can hear him, his heart on the strings
I can see him, bearing the passing time on my face
I'm proud to confess his faith
Of a thousand and one songs this is the one that I hum

Old days, beautiful days
I love his memory
He calls me and I run to him
That was a lovely way to play

Old songs summon him
I still feel the sun's light
I can still hear the drone of the wind
I can still hear him in the voice of the wind

With a song he drove my sadness far away
All I can give him is that I belong to him
And I can say to my son with pride
He's my father, and here's my home

Old days, beautiful days
I love his memory
He calls me and I run to him
That was a lovely way to play

Old songs summon him
I still feel the sun's light
The wind whistled a lullaby so my dream would be beautiful
The wind whistled a lullaby, I can ѕtill hear it todаy
