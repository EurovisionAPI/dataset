All my life I've wondered why
I keep fighting all the tides
For a million reasons that I find
But I might, I might be all wrong

I've hit highs and I've hit lows
But somewhere down the winding road
It felt like I could lose it all
But I might, I might have been wrong

A storm like this
Can break a man like this
But when it all calms down
We're still safe and sound

All my life I've tried to find
The meaning of what's left behind
They say it's life itself but I feel
It might, it might be all wrong

A storm like this
Can break a man like this
And when it all calms down
We're still safe and sound

A storm like this
Can break a man like this
And when it all calms down
We'll be safe and sound

Even if the sky falls down
We can turn it all around
We'll escape the darkest clouds
Then we'll be safe and sound

Wherever we may go
Whatever happens down the road
However far from home
I know we won't let go

A storm like this
Can break a man like this
And when it all calms down
We'll be safe and sound

Even if the sky falls down
We can turn it all around
We'll escape the darkest clouds
Then we'll be safe and sound

A storm like this
Can break a man like this
And when it all calms down
We'll be safe and sound

In no time the storm will end
It'll be alright again
The battle scarѕ won't matter then
But I might, I might be аll wrong
