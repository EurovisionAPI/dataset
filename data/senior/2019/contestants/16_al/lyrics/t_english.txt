Return to the Land

You sing and cry
In hands, tears are gathered
You hold them

One day you live
The next you die
So much nostalgia, so little hope
Alone, no identity

Return to your land
Oh man that let the heart hostage
Return to your land
You know there is a heart waiting for you

One day you live
The next you die
So much nostalgia, so little hope
Alone, no identity

Return to your land
Oh man that let the heart hostage
Return to your land
You know there iѕ a heart wаiting for you
