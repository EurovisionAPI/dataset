Money

It's really hot down in the suburbs
Mum don't worry I'm on my way home
You will be upset by a liar
It looked like love to you, it was something else
He's drinking champagne during Ramadan
On tv they are airing Jackie Chan
He's smoking shisha and asks me how I'm doing

He asks me how I'm doing, doing, doing
You already know how things are going, going, going
I think faster to try to figure out
If you're going to fool me tomorrow
I have no time to clear things up
'Cause I finally found out what you are
It hurts to be alive
When you lose your pride
You leave home out of the blue
You, tell me if

You only cared for the money, money
As if I have had any money, money
Tell me whether you miss me or you don't give a damn
You used to ask me how I was doing, doing, doing
Now how are things going, going, going

What you're supposed to say you haven't said yet
Betrayal is a bullet in your chest
Keep all the compassion to yourself
You keep lyin' at home but you know she knows
Sittin' there she'll be asking me

Asking me how I'm doing, doing, doing
You already know how things are going, going, going
I think faster to try to figure out
If you're going to fool me tomorrow
I have no time to clear things up
'Cause I finally found out what you are
It hurts to be alive
When you lose your pride
I figured it out in one second
That you, from me

You only wanted money, money
As if I have had any money, money
Before you would talk to me till late
You used to ask me how I'm doing, doing, doing
Now how are things going, going, going

My son, my son, my love, come here
You used to tell me while playing with me looking proud
My son, my son, my love, it seemed real
The desire, the desire to bring things back to what they were

I didn't ask for your money
It hurts to be alive
When you lose your pride
You leave home out of the blue
You, tell me if

You only wanted money, money
As if I had any money, money
You leave the city without anybody knowing
Yesterday you were here, where are you now, dad?
You ask me how I'm doing, doing, doing
You already know how thingѕ аre going, going, going
