Better Love

Live for the mess
Make me feel ageless
No pain, no gain
Teach me carelessness

And I'm about to see all that's made up
And everything they want from us
No pain, no gain
Once bitten, make way

And I can't hide it
I won't fight this
Yearning feeling inside

Gotta get

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love

There's nothing more to say to back it up when I am
Unafraid, I've lost enough
Go on, hold on for dear life

'Cause I won't hide it
I can't fight this
Burning feeling inѕide

Gotta get

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love

Won't you lean on me
You can lean on me
Let them look, don't know, don't care
Go deep with me
Go deep with me
Go deep with me

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love

What you wаiting for? (x15)
