Spirit In The Sky

Can't you stay
Stay with me into the night
Stay, I need you close
You can go back when the sun rise again
Just stay tonight, just stay

Have you seen my spirit
Lost in the night
The violent nightshade
They took away my light
They call us nothing
My name is nothing
Come see me
Please see me

Cause I've been running with the demons now
They all see my fear
They say there's nothing
Nothing here

I see your spirit in the sky
When northern lights are dancing
He-lo e loi-la
I hear you calling me at night
Whenever wind is blowing
He-lo e loi-la
I can see your spirit in the sky
When northern lights are dancing
He-lo e loi-la
Čajet dan čuovgga

I'll follow you until the daylight
Shy us away

I need a hero
I need my light
Her shining lightwaves
Will break away the night
I call it freedom
Our name is freedom
Come find me
Please find me

Cause I am dancing with the fairies now
They all sing our name
I got my light here
Shining here

I hear you calling me at night
Whenever wind is blowing
He-lo e loi-la
I can see your spirit in the sky
When northern lights are dancing
He-lo e loi-la
Čajet dan čuovgga

I hear you calling me at night
Whenever wind is blowing
He-lo e loi-la
I can see your spirit in the sky
When northern lights are dancing
He-lo e loi-la
Čajet dan čuovgga

I see your spirit in the sky
When northern lightѕ are dancing
He-lo e loi-la
Čajet dan čuovggа
