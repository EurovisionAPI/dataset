Chameleon

I'm bluer than the ocean
I'm golden like the rising sun and
I'm red with hot emotion

And when they try to hold me down
Inside a box, I'll find my way out
I'm keeping it in motion

When life brings me trouble
This I know
I never walk away, na na
We are technicolour, watch us go
We never walk away, na na
Just stay with me now

The grass is always greener
When you love me deeper, darling
I can be your jungle

So when they try to hold me down
Inside a box, I'll find my way out
I'm keeping it in motion

When life brings me trouble
This I know
I never walk away, na na
Walk away, na na
We are technicolour, watch us go
We never walk away, na na
Just stay with me now

Chame-chameleon

Chame-chameleon

Give me water, I'm a swimmer
Give me fire, I'm a fighter
Give me love, I'm your lover

Make me cry, I'll be a river
Take my heart, I'll be a giver
I can change, like the weather

When life brings me trouble
This I know
I never walk away, na na
We are technicolour, watch us go
We never walk away, na na
I never walk away na na

Give me water, I'm a swimmer
Give me fire, I'm a fighter
Give me love, I'm your lover

When life brings me trouble
Thiѕ I know
I never walk away, na na
