Hey, how you've been?
I wonder, do you ever think of me?
Say, am I wrong
To wonder if it could be you and me?

Is it too late for love?
Mhm
Is it too late for love?
I wanna know
Is it too late for love?
I can't take no more
Is it?

I could be the sun that lights your dark
And maybe I would lit your world with just one spark
I could make it burn for you and me
If I could be there
I would be there
Hear me!

I could be the sun that lights your dark
<i style="color:#789">Oh, is it too late for love?</i>
Mhm
<i style="color:#789">Is it too late for love?</i>
Hear me!
I could make it burn for you and me

Days came and went
But nothing ever really felt the same
But you left a space
Where everything reminds me of your face

Is it too late for love?
Mhm
Is it too late for love?
I wanna know

I could be the sun that lights your dark
And maybe I would lit your world with just one spark
I could make it burn for you and me
If I could be there
I would be there
Hear me!

I could be the sun that lights your dark
<i style="color:#789">Oh, is it too late for love?</i>
Oh no
<i style="color:#789">Is it too late for love?</i>
Hear me!
I could make it burn for you and me
<i style="color:#789">Oh, is it too late for love?</i>
No noo
<i style="color:#789">Is it too late for love?</i>

We could be a storm that rages on
And maybe we would own the ocean carry on

Noo…
I could be the sun that lights your dark
And maybe I would lit your world with just one spark
I could make it burn for you and me
If I could be there
I would be there
Hear me!

I could be the sun that lights your dark
<i style="color:#789">Oh, is it too late for love?</i>
Is it too late for love?
<i style="color:#789">Is it too late for love?</i>
It isn't is too lаte for love? 
Iѕ it?
