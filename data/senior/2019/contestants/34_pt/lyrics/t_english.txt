Cellphones

I broke my cellphone
Trying to call heaven
To know if I would kill this longing
Or if I would die instead

And who kills whom?
Who kills who kills?
Who kills whom?
Even I don't know

When I do know
I won't call anyone else

And if life calls
If life sends a text
If it doesn't stop
If you don't have the guts to pick up
You already know what will happen

I will go down my stairs
I will ruin the cellphone
The celly
I will break the cellphone
Yours and mine
And I will ruin the cellphone
I want to live and break the cellphone to pieces

And what if I break the cellphone?
I only break what's mine
I'm waiting to see if this longing dies
Maybe, it'll turn out that I'll die instead

Who kills who kills?
I don't even know
Snitches don't see anyone being born

I used to break cellphones
But I'll never break mine again
I know this longing is dead
The one who sent the arrow was me

The one who sent the arrow was me
It wаѕ me
