King

I am me, and I know I will always be
I am free, sure I am inventing my life
Don't ask me who I am
I am the same since I was very little
And in spite of looks, opinions
I cry, I go out and I laugh

You put me in a box, want me to be like you
I don't follow the codes, people are disturbed a lot
At the end of the day, you cannot change me, boo
So, let me fly

I, I'm not rich, but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
When I dream, I am a king
When I dream, I am a king
I'm not rich, but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
When I dream, I am a king

And I know-oh-oh-ow, even though-oh-oh-oh
You try to take me down, you cannot break me, nah, nah
All these voices: "Do like this, do like that"
I don't look right through them, you'll never remove my crown

Who are we ?
When we hurt, when we fight for free
Only god can judge you and me
We did not choose what we are
We choose
Our work, our hairstyle, our friends
Our routine, sometimes love too
It's make or break but it's none of your business

I, I'm not rich, but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
When I dream, I am a king
When I dream, I am a king
I'm not rich, but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
When I dream, I am a king

And I know-oh-oh-ow, even though-oh-oh-oh
You try to take me down, you cannot break me, nah, nah
All these voices: "Do like thiѕ, do like that"
I don't look right through them, you'll never remove my crown

I am a king
When I dream, I am а king
