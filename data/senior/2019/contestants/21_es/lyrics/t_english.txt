The Blindfold

They buy you because you sell yourself
You sell yourself because you're more than enough for you
You get lost because there's a way
I can tell you: there are other options
You do it so well because you love yourself
You love yourself and your sharp mind
You choose yourself because there's a way
I can tell you: there are other options

The blindfold fell down and joy is the only thing left
The blindfold fell down and new days will now come
The blindfold fell down, fueling fantasies
The blindfold fell down and you'll be just like you wanted

You pray to yourself because you trust yourself
You feel like you already had it
You live in high voltage
I brought you some good news
You are enough and you don't have to force it anymore
You live and you like yourself
You ignore the rules because there are no more
Now, only the crazy life

The blindfold fell down and joy is the only thing left
The blindfold fell down and new days will now come
The blindfold fell down, fueling fantasies
The blindfold fell down and you'll be just like you wanted

What you are, what you are, are, are
What you are, what you are, are, are
What you are, what you are, are, are
What you are, what you are, are, are
What you are, what you are, are, are
What you are, what you are, are, are

The blindfold fell down and joy is the only thing left
The blindfold fell down and new days will now come
The blindfold fell down, fueling fantasies
The blindfold fell down and you'll be juѕt like you wаnted
