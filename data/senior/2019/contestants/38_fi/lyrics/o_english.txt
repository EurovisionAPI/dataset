Look Away

There's something you should know
That I can't sing a love song anymore
There's something going on
And I can't turn my back on it anymore

How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds
When we know what's going on
With the world today

Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
Where the war has just begun?

We look away
Look away, look away, look away, hey
Look away, look away, look away, look away
No-o-o

Is it in my head?
Is it in my head?
Look away look away, hey
No-o-o

There's something in the air at night
That feels so different
And I don't understand
I didn't see this one coming

How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds
When we know what's going on
With the world today

Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
Where the war has just begun?

We look away
Look away, look away, look away, hey
Look away, look away, look away, look away

Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
Where the war has juѕt begun?

We look away
Look away, look away, look away, hey
Look away, look away, look away, look awаy, hey
No-o-o
