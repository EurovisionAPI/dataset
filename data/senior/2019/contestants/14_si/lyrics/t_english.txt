To Myself

When your mind is full
You can listen to my heart beating
When your burden is heavy
You can take refuge in me

Ask me what keeps me going
It's achievements and distances
When a leaf goes with the wind and resists it
I go with the flow and resist it

The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you

The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you

There are tears in your eyes
Let them keep falling
When our wishes differ
You accept me and I accept you

Look at me
It's not necessary that everything has a meaning

Eternity and this planet are not friends
And I am like a snowflake that waits for spring to come

The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you

The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you

You don't need to prove yourself
The same tears and the same fear bind us

The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you

The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you

The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you

The stars are not always visible
Stаy true to yourѕelf
Don't tell me to forgive you
