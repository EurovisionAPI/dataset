Woman in her dreams too

It's the wind, it's the rain, it's the child too
From silences to challenges, she likes the night
Sometimes sad, she puts the weapons down
Innocent or charming, she's a woman

Woman, in her life, in her dreams too
Woman, in her eyes, her cries, her confessions
Woman, beloved woman and loving woman
Woman, elegance, and woman who dances

Melody, melodrama, smile and then tears
In love or without soul, first of all she's woman

Woman, in her life, in her dreams too
Woman, in her eyes, her cries, her confessions
Woman, beloved woman and loving woman
Woman, elegance, and woman who dances

Woman, in her life, in her dreams too
Woman, elegance, and woman who dances

And who dances… dances…
Dances… dances…
Dances… dances…

Oh, woman, in her life, in her dreams too
Woman, in her eyes, her cries, her confessions
Woman, beloved woman and loving woman
Woman, elegance, and woman who dances

In her dreams too
Woman, in her eyes, her cries, her confessions
Woman, beloved woman and loving woman
Woman, elegance, and woman who dances
