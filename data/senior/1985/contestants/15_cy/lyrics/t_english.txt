I realised it too late

Another day gone without a purpose
I'm alone in empty time in this world
In my bedroom, looking down again
Only happiness, when thinking of the past

You finished like a melodious song
You were a small musical piece
Your scent stayed like a note on paper
A living stamp of a loving moment

I loved you, I kept you in my life
But you're gone and loneliness breaks me
I had a desire of locking you in my heart
But it was wrong, I realised it too late

I'll always remember you as a feast
A loving and eternal icon
A sweet memory you won't vanish
A secret hope you'll be back

I loved you, I kept you in my life
But you're gone and loneliness breaks me
I had a desire of locking you in my heart
But it was wrong, I realised it too late

I had a desire of locking you in my heart
But it was wrong, I realiѕed it too lаte
