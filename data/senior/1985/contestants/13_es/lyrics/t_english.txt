The party's over

Love, what are you doing here?
The party's over
Tell me, what are you playing?
Love, what happened, happened
We said it's over
What are you looking for?

Love, I don't want to treat you badly
It's better not to insist
There's no more magic in your hands
Love, excuse me if I say love
It wasn't my intention
Maybe it's because I loved you
And now I don't

The party's over
There's only a fog between you and me
Why throwing more wood to burn
When the fire is already dull? Tell me

Love, I'm finally over you
And I'm not thinking about going back
Again to my old tricks
Love, excuse me if I say love
It wasn't my intention
Maybe it's because I loved you
And now I don't

The party's over
There's only a fog between you and me
Why throwing more wood to burn
When the fire is already dull? Tell me

Don't insist anymore, the party's over
You and I are no longer you and I
Why should we love each other without love?
Why ѕhould we keep on lying to eаch other?
Tell me, tell me
