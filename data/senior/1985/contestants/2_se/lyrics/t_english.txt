Good Vibrations

Where have you been?
I know that you existed, before I got to see you
Of course there where others in my life
But no one could offer me more than pastime

But today I feel something I've never felt
I can see, that something has happened

You give me good vibrations
Every time you take my hand in yours
And every time you smile
I get good vibrations
That can lead to something much more
And I think love is on its way, taking big steps

We just met the other day
But I have gotten used to have you around
Even though you are more than just a friend
It is too soon to call it love

And we have much left, now we're only at the beginning
But tonight, I know, that it'll be you

Who give me good vibrations
Every time you take my hand in yours
And everytime you smile
I get good vibrations
That can lead to something much more
And I think love is on its way, taking big steps

That there might be problems I have learned
If someone says 'yes' too soon
But it is actually quite hard to say no
When you are the one that I want

You give me good vibrations
Every time you take my hand in yours
And every time you smile
I get good vibrations
That can lead to something much more
And I think love is on its way, tаking big stepѕ
