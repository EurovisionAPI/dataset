Children, children, children

Na na na na…

All children have in their eyes crazy dreams, blue dreams
Little giants with blond wicks, they have the words of another world
Bad children or good children, we'd say they're on a holiday
All children are pictures

All children are captains, they are called Mozart or Verlaine
While the capital is sleeping, they have fun with the stars
Little treasures or mean devils, they are all essential to us
All children are terrific

Children, show us the path of life by singing
Give us a hand

All children have all the magic of explorers in their heart
Baby champions or gold diggers, they see life in technicolor
On all walls they've written "down with blues" and "long live life"
All children are tightrope walkers, they say "I love you" while making bubbles

All children are magicians, they have the earth in the hollow of their hands
(Children)
With their crocodile tears, they are the kings of the year two thousand
(Let's all stay children)
They eat ice and set fire, they annoy us and it's so much the better
(In love and alive)
All children are marvellous
(For eternity)

All children have in their eyes crazy dreams, blue dreams
(Children)
Little giants with blond wicks, they have the words of another world
(Show us the path)
Bad children or good children, we'd say they're on a holiday
(Of life by singing)
All children are pictures
(Give us a hand)

All children are captains, they are called Mozart or Verlaine
While the capital is sleeping, they have fun with the stars
Little treasures or mean devils, they are all essential to us
All children are terrific

Children
(Children are loud, screaming and crying, we need to go to them when they cry)
(We are children, they are children, children are all around us)
Show us the path
(Children are small, learn to be tall, look at them, you'll see your life go by)
(Children are here, children are there, the world needs children so much)
Of life by singing
(Out of their place, dirt on their face, children make everyone sing along)
(Children are old, children are young, children are childlike and brilliant)
Give us a hand
(Sharing our dreams right to the end)
(Children, that's what we all are)

Children
(Children are good, children are bad, doing their best to drive you mad)
(Children are loud, children are quiet, children can often only understand a child)
Let's all stay children
(Children are neat, honest and sweet, holding their dreams in people's hand)
(Children are small, grow very fast, by them you see the time passing by)
In love and alive
(Children are cute, children are wise, look at the laughter in their eyes)
(Children are wild, children see everything with different eyes)
For eternity
(Children are starѕ)
(We are children, they аre children)

Children, children, children
