Long live life

It's night in the city but I don't see any stars
A thousand stars aren't shining
They're left behind a grey veil
It's night in the city, I stayed in the park with you
You're standing in front me full of hope
And your eyes are telling me this

Long live life and the night
Long live the dark sky and the belt of stars
Wish like I do that a star doesn't hit a star
The feeling of sympathy
Which grandfather told of is what the earth needs
So that the children of the world can watch the stars

It's night in the city, I see your starry eyes
Under a good friends arm
I'll hide my furry head
I am happy because I stayed with you
You're standing in front of me full of hope
And your eyes are telling me this

Long live life and the night
Long live the dark sky and the belt of stars
Wish like I do that a star doesn't hit a star
The feeling of sympathy
Which grandfather told of is what the earth needs
So that the children of the world can watch the stars

I stayed here full of hope
Because your eyes are telling me this

Long live life and the night
Long live the dark sky and the belt of stars
Wish like I do that a star doesn't hit a star
The feeling of sympathy
Which grandfather told of is what the earth needs
So that the children of the world can watch the stаrѕ
