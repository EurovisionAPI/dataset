There's Life On Earth

City sleeps in the night under the sad cloudy sky
Can't see those tender and golden lights, those millions of worlds passing by
City sleeps in the night, you hold my hand in the park
I see your blue eyes so full of hope, I hear your promising words in the dark

There is life, there is life on Earth
There are babies of the future waiting for birth
Do you know what it needs, my love, and what it is worth?
Love the night, love the night and the stars
Love the summer in Venus, feel the winter in Mars
Stop the empty and heartless people building their bombs

City sleeps in the night, you wipe away all my tears
You take me into your world of love, you wipe away all suspicions and fears
City sleeps in the night, you hold my hand in the park
I see your blue eyes so full of hope, I hear your promising words in the dark

There is life, there is life on Earth
There are babies of the future waiting for birth
Do you know what it needs, my love, and what it is worth?
Love the night, love the night and the stars
Love the summer in Venus, feel the winter in Mars
Stop the empty and heartless people building their bomb

I see a dream of the stars in the park, I hear your promising words in the dark

There is life, there is life on Earth
There are babies of the future waiting for birth
Do you know what it needs, my love, and what it is worth?
Love the night, love the night and the stars
Love the summer in Venus, feel the winter in Mars
Stop the empty and heаrtless people building their bombѕ
