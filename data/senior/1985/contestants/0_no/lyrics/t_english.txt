Let it swing

From a radio old melodies flow
And I wake up and ask myself what's going on
Is this only dream and fantasies
When I feel that it's swinging more and more?

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho…
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll

Let the music live, never let the rhythm stop
Can you feel that you're alive right here and now?
Do you feel how much you want to dance?
Oh… and do you hear your heart beating on and on?

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho…
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll

Do you feel how much you want to dance?
Do you hear your heart beating on and on
And on?

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho…
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose аll control
Oh hi ho…
Let it ѕwing, let it rock 'n'
Swing, let it roll 'n'
Swing, let it rock 'n' roll
