Diday diday day

In love, patience is not enough
I can't get away from this feeling
I am avoiding all my friends
Love caught me, I fell in love with you

Oh oh oh… diday diday day… oh oh oh… diday diday day…

Always working, it never stops
The days without you are endless
I am avoiding all my friends
Love caught me, I fell in love with you

Oh oh oh… diday diday day… oh oh oh… diday diday day…
Oh oh oh… diday diday day… oh oh oh… diday diday day…

Stay with me
Our love will be easy
Let everyone know that we love each other
You should be de first to believe me, ah…

Oh oh oh… diday diday day… oh oh oh… diday diday day…

Diday diday day… diday diday day…
Let everyone know that we love each other
You should be de first to believe me, ah…

Oh oh oh… diday diday day… oh oh oh… diday diday day…

In love, patience is not enough
I can't get away from this feeling
I am avoiding all my friendѕ
Oh oh oh… day diday dаy…
