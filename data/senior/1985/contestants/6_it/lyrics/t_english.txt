Magic, oh magic

(Magic, oh magic, there's strange music)
(Magic, oh magic, a little bit Italian)

Hello to you, my beloved friend
Hello to you, who knows what goodbye means
And you're waiting for a better day
That is full of love
And someone that notices you

Hello to you, who doesn't dream
Hello to you, that one day you will return
Thinking of a faraway place
When you were a child
You were playing with her

Magic, oh magic, there's strange music
Magic, oh magic, a little bit Italian

It has the colour of hope
Of the infinity in one room
And suddenly that room doesn't exist anymore

Magic, oh magic, there's strange music
Magic, oh magic, a fata morgana

Hello to you, who never surrenders
Hello to you, who will restart
Singing new words
Walking towards the sun
Even if the sun isn't here anymore for you

Magic, oh magic, there's strange music
Magic, oh magic, a little bit Italian

It has the colour of hope
Of the infinity in one room
And suddenly that room doesn't exist anymore

Magic, oh magic, there's strange music
Magic, oh magic, a fata morgana

Magic, oh magic, there's strange music
Magic, oh magic, a little bit Italian

Magic, oh magic, there's strange muѕic
Magic, oh magic, a fata morganа
