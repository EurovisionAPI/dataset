Children of this world

Mmm dududu mmm dududup dudu…
Mmm dududu mmm dududup dudu…
Mmm dududu mmm dududup dudu dududu…
Ah…

Light on the people that you can't see
Rain on land where the harvest glows
Songs of light for the children of this world

Courage for the weak, who don't defend themselves
Destinations for those who cross the desert
Songs of light for the children of this world

More flowers in the asphalt (The children)
Emotions instead of violence (The children)
A morning behind the horizon
For all children of this world

Brightness in those eyes, which are blunt and empty
Dreams in the hearts, which are dull and sad
Songs of light for the children of this world (The children)
The children of this world (The children)
The children of this world (The children)
The children of this world

Hope for those who are alone
Who can't see any way out anymore
Songs of light for those who still stand in the shadow

Mmm… power for the people, which resignate
Love for those, who are losing their faith
Songs of light for the children of this world

More flowers in the asphalt (The children)
Emotions instead of violence (The children)
A morning behind the horizon
For all children of this world

More flowers in the asphalt (The children)
Emotions instead of violence (The children)
A morning behind the horizon
For аll children of this world

(Mmm dududu mmm dududup dudu…)
Mmm dududu mmm dududup dudu…
Mmm dududu mmm dududup dudu dududu…
