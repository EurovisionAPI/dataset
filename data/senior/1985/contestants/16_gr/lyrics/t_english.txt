We resemble

Some differences will always separate us
Aesthetic or class or even others
However the moments will always unite us
Which simple people call great

We resemble like two drops of rain
And whatever words you say are secrets in your anger
We resemble and if you are cut in two
Somehow you may think I'm your other half

Some differences will always separate us
You will embitter me and I may scold you somehow
However the moments will always unite us
Which make the pain more human

We resemble like two drops of rain
And whatever words you say are secrets in your anger
We resemble and if you are cut in two
Somehow you may think I'm your other half

We resemble like two drops of rain
And whatever words you say are secrets in your anger
We resemble and if you are cut in two
Somehow you may think I'm your other hаlf
