For everyone

How many people are awake
In a clear, starry night?
They don't know what exactly will come tomorrow
And still they are dreaming about it

They believe in tenderness
And that there will be a bit of hope left
In little things and in a distant aim
And also in a feeling

For everyone here, who can see the rainbow in the darkness
And the truth which is always hidden
For everyone here, who can understand the unspoken words
For all of them I'm singing a song

For everything here, for the wishes that stand in children's eyes
For the dreams and for the fantasy
And for the courage, that fights the doubts and the fear
For everyone I'm singing a song

Thoughts often turn around
And dreams have their own price
But for as long as there are people
Yearning still has a song

For everyone here, who can see the rainbow in the darkness
And the truth which is always hidden
For everyone here, who can understand the unspoken words
For all of them I'm singing a song

For everyone here, for the wishes, that stands in children's eyes
For the dreams and for the fantasy
And for the courage, that fights the doubts and the fear
For аll of them is this ѕong
