Going up and up

Light and azure in the sky, and suddenly the day appears
Clouds turn into water, a rainbow rises in the heavens
A variety of shades and a light of the sky that colour the world
And it's far more beautiful and it smiles to everyone

Together the song goes up and up
When joy blossoms in your heart
Together the song goes up and up
Big and small, like a rainbow

To each other wanting to approach, together asking to dream
To one another weaving a rainbow, peace has a thousand colours
So they come to sing tonight from the four corners of the world
The joy in the heart is not enough, a moment of light for all

Together the song goes up and up
When joy blossoms in your heart
Together the song goes up and up
Big and small, like a rainbow

And meanwhile the song grows louder, bringing the hearts together
Angels spread their wings and the candles are lit

Together the song goes up and up
When joy blossoms in your heart
Together the song goes up and up
Big and small, like a rainbow

Together the song goes up and up
When joy blossoms in your heart
Together the song goes up and up
Big and small, like a rainbow

Nananana… nanananana…
Nananananana…
Together the song goes up and up
Big and ѕmall, like a rainbow

Like a rainbow
(Like a rаinbow)
