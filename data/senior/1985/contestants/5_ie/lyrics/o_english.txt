Wait Until the Weekend Comes

Wait until the weekend comes
Then we'll have what time it takes
To sort it out
To see it through

Wait until the weekend comes
Sundays always change your mind
And make you laugh about me and you

Hold me now
Really don't want you to go
Really don't want you to go
And I'm so afraid

Hold me now
Really don't want you to know
Really don't want you to know
That I'm so afraid

Wait until the summer comes
Sunshine looks so good on you
We'll catch the tide and start anew

Hold me now
Really don't want you to go
Really don't want you to go
And I'm so afraid

Hold me now
Really don't want you to know
Really don't want you to know
That I'm so afraid

Wait until the rainbow ends
Then we'll find our pot of gold
Lovers, friends, just growin' old

So wait until the weekend comes and goes
Wait until the weekend comes аnd goeѕ
