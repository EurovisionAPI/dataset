Love Is...

It's been a pleasant evening
Now she says she's leaving
And he's too proud to say out loud
Oh baby, won't you stay?

Now she says she'll call him
She finds herself fallin'
When he reaches out and touches her hand
She turns to walk away
'Cause there's always a weak one
Always a strong one, who'll be the first to fall?

Love is the danger of meeting a stranger
And takin' a chance on two hearts makin' it
Love is the fire, the burnin' desire
That makes the world go round
Love is the feelin' that makes you believe in
Takin' a chance on two hearts beatin' as one
That's what love is

Still she's hesitating
Is the ice worth breaking?
Should she hold back or rush right in
Where angels fear to tread?
'Cause there's always a weak one
Always a strong one, who'll be the first to fall?

Love is the danger of meeting a stranger
And takin' a chance on two hearts makin' it
Love is the fire, the burnin' desire
That makes the world go round
Love is the feelin' that makes you believe in
Takin' a chance on two hearts beatin' as one
That's what love is, hoh…

Love is the danger of meeting a stranger
And takin' a chance on two hearts makin' it
Love is the fire, the burnin' desire
That makes the world go round
Love is the feelin' that makes you believe in
Takin' a chance

Love is the danger of meeting a stranger
And takin' a chance on two hearts makin' it
Love is the fire, the burnin' desire
That makes the world go round
Love is the feelin' that makes you believe in
Takin' a chance

Love is the danger of meeting a stranger
And takin' a chance on two hearts makin' it
Love is the fire, the burnin' desire
That mаkeѕ the world go round
