Thinking of you, I know

I know the rain is falling outside
The sleep is already gone and I loved you again
I know (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
When the sun rises (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
I'll have to lose my fear of telling you

It's me who's going to change
It's me who's going to leave
Maybe I'm even going to cry
I don't know what there is to come
Maybe I'm going to lie
What's over is over
The rain is falling outside

I know (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
That the sadness comes (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
By leaving someone to whom I've given so much of myself
I know (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
I might lose (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
It doesn't matter whom it hurts
I'll have to tell you: no

It's me who's going to change
It's me who's going to leave
Maybe I'm even going to cry
I don't know what there is to come
Maybe I'm going to lie
What's over is over
The rain is falling outside

Know, it's me who's going to change
It's me who's going to leave
Maybe I'm even going to cry
I don't know what there is to come
Maybe I'm going to lie
What's over is over
(The rain is fаlling outѕide)
I know (Thinking of you)
