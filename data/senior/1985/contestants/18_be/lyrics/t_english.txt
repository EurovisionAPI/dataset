Let me go now

Let me go now, say no more, let me go now
Don't you feel, your words are not helping me anymore for a long time
Please, let me go, forget me, please let me go
Didn't you ever see that no love can live without warmth
And that I want to dream my life again
As if I had never met you?

Never again I want to be with you, you hurt me
Never again I want someone else to live my life
Don't touch me, no, don't touch me
Leave me alone, I saw the world only through your eyes
I feel betrayed, I loved you
You never understood that, never understood

Do you see now what I always wanted to tell you?
Then you also know how long an empty night can last
When one hopes and waits, exhausted and tired of thinking
Do you realise now something in me will break when I leave you?

Don't let me go, please look at me
Don't let me go, do you reаlly let me go like thiѕ?
