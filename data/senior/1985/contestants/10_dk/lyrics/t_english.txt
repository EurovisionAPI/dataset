Wouldn't you like to know?

An hour passed, well probably more
And I keep speculating:
Now, who was it, that you were?
Then I finally got an answer, it was obvious
When we were kids we were friends
In the yard at home, we often played theatre
When someone asked who we should look like, you'd answer:

Wouldn't you like to know? (Do you dare or not?)
Wouldn't you like to know, then just ask me
Come along to our dream island
Where you can get exactly what you want
Wouldn't you like to know? (Say it once more)
Wouldn't you like to know? Don't you see
If you want to, we'll go to
The place where everything can happen

I cautiously went to the jockey of the place
And asked for something with a bit less rock
I saw you get up and come this way
Straight towards me
Did you still remember me? I think so
You wanted to dance with me, but as you asked
I couldn't really help laughing and saying:

Wouldn't you like to know? (Do you dare or not?)
Wouldn't you like to know, then just ask me
Come along to our dream island
Where you can get exactly what you want
Wouldn't you like to know? (Say it once more)
Wouldn't you like to know? Don't you see
If only you want to, we'll go to my secret place
If you want to, then come along
No

Wouldn't you like to know? (Do you dare or not?)
Would you like to know, then just ask me
Come along to our dream iѕland
Where you can get exactly what you want
Wouldn't you like to know? (Say it once more)
Wouldn't you like to know? Yeah
If you want to, we'll go to
The place where everything can hаppen
