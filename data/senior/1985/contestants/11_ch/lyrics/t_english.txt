Slowly, slowly

You, it was a beautiful day
And you, I would like to tell you
That I like you very much
And I want to see you again sometime
But now it's better that I go

And love, no, love
A beautiful day, I like you
But it must not be love

Slowly, slowly, just so far, always
Slowly, slowly, just so much, always
Slowly, slowly, just fun, no tears
Slowly, slowly, just so far, always
Slowly, slowly, just so much, always
Slowly, slowly, no questions or scenes

You, I like to be close to you
And you, I feel extremely good with you
And I want to see you again quite soon
But now it's better that I go

And love, no, love
A beautiful day, I like you
But it must not be love

Slowly, slowly, just so far, always
(You, it was a beautiful day)
Slowly, slowly, just so much, always
Slowly, slowly, just fun, no tears
(You, I would like to tell you)
(That I like you very much)
Slowly, slowly, just so far, always
(And I want to see you again sometime)
Slowly, slowly, just so much, always
Slowly, slowly, no questions or scenes
(But now it's better that I go)

And love, no, love
No, it mustn't be love but although
I feel inside thаt I love you

Slowly, slowly
Slowly, slowly, no questions or scenes
Slowly, ѕlowly
