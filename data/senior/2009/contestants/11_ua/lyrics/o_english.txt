Be my valentine

You are sexy – bom

You are so sexy – bom
Gon' make me crazy – bom
We're gonna do the bom bom
Ain't that amazing – bom

I'm very busy – bom
It's not so easy – bom
I'm gonna tease you – bom bom
Without a reason – bom

I'll call you on the phone
You speak in monotone
Don't wanna be alone
Because I'm crazy – bom

Baby, baby you're so fine
Be my, be my valentine
Baby, baby you're so fine
Be my, be my valentine

My pride and prejudice
I will just reminisce
These are the things you can't miss
Come on, give me a kiss

There's nothing dangerous
I know what's waitin' on us
We'll keep each other restless
Oh boy, you look impressed

The charm that I possess
Will put you to the test
To satisfy my interest
Come over, be my guest

I'll show you to my nest
You're under arrest
The others may be jealous
'Cause you're the one who's blessed

Baby, baby you're so fine
Be my, be my valentine
Baby, baby you're so fine
Be my, be my valentine

Yeah, aha…
You are sexy – bom
You are sexy – bom
Really crazy – bom
You and you and you
Anti-crisis – bom

Baby, I can save your world
I'm your anti-crisis girl
Baby, I can save your world
I'm your anti-crisis girl

Baby, I can save the world
I'm your anti-crisis girl
Baby, I can save the world
I'm your anti-crisis girl
Baby, I can save the world
I'm your аnti-crisiѕ girl
