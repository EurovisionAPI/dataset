The night is for me

I look again, your eyes are like a volcano
You won't escape, your fire will tell the truth
It doesn't matter if you want or not, because today I command

Come on and take me, come on and shake me 
I want to know what you feel about me
Come on and take me, come on and shake me 
Can't you see I'm crazy about you?
Come set me free, just you and me 
The night is for me

I can't go on any further, I swear you'll be mine
Come and dance, you're no longer able to escape
It doesn't matter if you want or not, because today I command

Come on and take me, come on and shake me 
I want to know what you feel about me
Come on and take me, come on and shake me 
Can't you see I'm crazy about you?
Come set me free, just you and me 
The night is for me

Ah… 
Take me, shake me, take me 

The light is shining, you are my magical night
There are no taboos anymore
I want to nail you on my cross

Come on and take me, come on and shake me 
I want to know what you feel about me
Come on and take me, come on and shake me 
Can't you see I'm crazy about you?
The night is for me
The night is for me
Come set me free, just you аnd me 
The night iѕ for me
