Aven Romale

They used to call me Gipsy, hello there
It means no problem to me, I don't care
Till I've got microphone making you act
I love to be that gipsy rat

Word ain't key to me
I can't think that easily
If you keep that energy
Gipsy sounds like symphony

Hate me or love me, baby
Speed up from null to eighty
In next three seconds music turns you to slave it

(Aven Romale)
If you really wanna understand, just sing it with me: ada dadadai…
(Aven Romale)
I can make you really sing like Gipsy: adadada adadada…
(Aven Romale)
If you really wanna understand, just sing it with me: ada dadadai…
(Aven Romale)
I can make you really feel like Gipsy
Music is the miracle, rhythm is the mirror, that's right

It's truth that Gipsies are just everywhere
It means no problem to me, I don't care
Listen the song and free your frozen mind
And let the colours all behind

(I) can make you feel like
(Gipsy) Let colour behind
(Free) your Gipsy inside of your music soul to be like
(Oh) And what a wonder
(Truth) You got it inside
(Aven Čech, Jágr, pivo) Come together once more

(Aven Romale)
Ma ker the šun man more
Listen and don't matter where you're from
I'll make you jump, say it
(Aven Romale)

Praha Brno, normale
Češí ví, my name is Gee
So everybody rock with me, please
(Aven Romale)

If you really wanna understand, just sing it with me: ada dadadai…
(Aven Romale)
I can make you really sing like Gipsy: adadada adadada…
(Aven Romale)
If you really wanna understand, just sing it with me: ada dadadai…
(Aven Romale)
I can make you really feel like Gipsy
Music is the miracle, rhythm is the mirror, that's right

I feel something wrong
Made us separate the world on pieces
We got eyes and we still stay all so blind

(Aven Romale)
If you really wanna understand, just sing it with me: ada dadadai…
(Aven Romale)
I can make you really feel like Gipsy
Music is the miracle, rhythm is the mirror, thаt'ѕ right
