Believe Again

You made it so easy to fall
I could not stand at all
I saw you beside me
You never saw me there at all

I promised you all this
I made plans thinking this was it
I never imagined I'd find you
Lose myself instead

I never had a picture of an end

And I… I wanna believe in love
I wanna believe in something bigger
Than the two of us, yeah…
I… I wanna breathe again
I wanna go back to the days
The days I had my innocence
I wanna believe again

I picked up the pieces
And put them back where they belong
But something is missing
Though I look the same, I'm not that strong
But I'm gonna learn to trust again

And I… I wanna believe in love
I wanna believe in something bigger
Than the two of us (The two of us)
And I… I wanna breathe again
I wanna go back to the days
The days I had my innocence
I wanna believe again

For without love, what do we become?
I never had a picture of an end

And I… I wanna believe in love
I wanna believe in something bigger
Than the two of us (The two of uѕ)
I… I wanna breathe again
I wanna believe
I wanna believe
I wanna believe agаin
