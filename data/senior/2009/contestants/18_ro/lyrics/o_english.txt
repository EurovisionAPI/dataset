The Balkan Girls

The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody

It's time for me to unwind
I'm gonna start my weekend with gin, tonic and lime
My girls take me for a ride
Ready to party and looking so fine

I wonder if beyond this
There could be something better
'Cause I feel so good tonight
Don't wanna end this night

The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody
(For crowd delight, we'll shine all night)
The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody
(For crowd delight, we'll shine all night)

My hips are ready to glow
This record is so hot and I have so much to show
I'll find a boy for a kiss
Who knows, maybe he'll be my prince

I wonder if beyond this
There could be something better
'Cause I feel so good tonight
Don't wanna end this night

The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody
(For crowd delight, we'll shine all night)
The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody
(For crowd delight, we'll shine all night)

(You've gotta live your life…)
If you didn't find out
What love is about
And if you're lonely, baby
Just open your mind, you're one of a kind
You've got to live your life…

The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody
(For crowd delight, we'll shine all night)
The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody
(For crowd delight, we'll shine all night)

The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody
(For crowd delight, we'll shine all night)
The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody
(For crowd delight, we'll ѕhine аll night)
