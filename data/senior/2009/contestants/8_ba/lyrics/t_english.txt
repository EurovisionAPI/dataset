Clear Water

I asked some people
In the neighbourhood, where my soul resides
A secret from me
They say you are hiding, dear

I asked that they return to me
That time, the old hours, the spring
That love is in the air
They say

Give birth to me at dawn in May
Bathe me in the clear water
I guard one world, when all others leave
I guard you as long as I'm alive

Steal a bit of sun for us
There's no tomorrow, there's no today
It all becomes easy as the song finds the heart

Give birth to me at dawn in May
Bathe me in the clear water
I guard one world, when all others leave
I guard you as long as I'm alive

Give birth to me at dawn in May
Bathe me in the clear water
I guard one world, when all others leave
I guard you as long aѕ I'm аlive
