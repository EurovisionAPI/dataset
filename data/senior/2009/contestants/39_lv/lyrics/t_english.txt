Traffic jam

Traffic jam – everyone's tired of this
Gloomy faces, nerves, I have to be the first to get through
And steel boxes appearing everywhere
Suddenly I see a girl above, jumping on the roofs

Jumping straight ahead
From a Mercedes to a Volvo
I rub my eyes, it could be a mirage
But my eyes already hurt

Hey, take me up there with you
I'm tired of giving up
I want to walk on bumpers
In fact, nothing is holding me back

Only, I don't know who you are
But I just want to be near you
To see how below the wind is bending bushes
At the side of a packed ring road

I see a fist out of a window
"Damn you!"
And I do a jump-hop, shredding my pants
I left, let it pass, going on like crazy
The air is pure CO2 – my head is spinning

This is no easy fun
From a Mercedes to a Volvo
And rushing to your silhouette
Very far away

Hey, take me with you forever
I'm tired of giving up
I want to walk on bumpers
In fact, nothing is holding me back

Hey, take me up there with you
I'm tired of giving up
I want to walk on bumpers
In fact, nothing is holding me back

Hey, take me with you forever
I'm tired of giving up
I want to walk on bumpers
In fact, nothing iѕ holding me bаck
