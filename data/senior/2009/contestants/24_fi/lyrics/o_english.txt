Lose control

I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling, falling down

I got this panic emotion that I cannot describe to you
My world is tumbling down, what am I, what am I gonna do?
Ca-can't deny it, deny it, what am I going through?
Ca-can not fight it, can't fight it, now I'm looking for the truth

I don't wanna live a lie – checking on my sanity
'Cause baby, maybe I can do without – is it all a fantasy?
I don't wanna live a lie – is this my reality?
It's spinning round 'n' round day 'n' night

I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one falling down
I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one falling down

I'm on a critical mission, got my destiny in my hands
Like Peter Piper I take control, put a spell on the mass
I cause hysteria, worry yourself, that's how I roll
It's not a drill, I'm for real, I'm a man who's out of control

I don't wanna live a lie – checking on my sanity
'Cause baby, maybe I can do without – is it all a fantasy?
I don't wanna live a lie – is this my reality?
It's spinning round 'n' round day 'n' night

I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one falling down
I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one falling down

I'm falling, I'm falling
And I just can't believe it
I'm falling, I'm falling down

I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one falling down
I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I juѕt can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one fаlling down
