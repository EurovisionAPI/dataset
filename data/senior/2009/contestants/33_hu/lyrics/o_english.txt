Dance With Me

I see it in your eyes, you wanna dance with me tonight
It's rainin' on your body as you're puttin' up a fight
The way you're moving, how you groove is somewhere out of sight
You know it's only fair to tell you that you do it right

Now with a little luck, I'm gonna meet you on the dance floor
Just by the way you move, you make me beg for more
I'm burning with desire, it's the night I've waited for

Don't you lose your emotion
Don't you be shy tonight
Let the rhythm show you
Baby, you can do it right
Alright tonight

Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way
Take a chance with me, make my body sway
It's an overload in a disco fantasy
Let's dance the night away

Just yesterday we were on the floor
Like somewhere in a movie or a club in Singapore
The lights are bright, the mood is raw
And in the middle of the night, we dance till we get sore

And in the middle of the night, I'll meet you on the dancefloor
Gonna make it, move your body, beg for more
With a rhythm and a beat, I'll rock you to the core

Don't you lose your emotion
Don't you be shy tonight
Let the rhythm show you
Baby, you can do it right
Alright tonight

Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way
Take a chance with me, make my body sway
It's an overload in a disco fantasy
Let's dance the night away

(Dance with me)
(Dance, dance, dance with me)
(Dance with me)

Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way
Take a chance with me, make my body sway
It's an overload in a disco fantasy
Let's dance the night away

Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way
Take a chance with me, make my body sway
It's an overload in a disco fantasy
Let'ѕ dance the night awаy
