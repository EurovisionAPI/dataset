Love

I've had it all, as a little child
I've done it all, as a little child
But the pain that I had
For the fame that I got, was for what?

A little girl is crying alone
A little boy, searching for his home
Giving up to a sin for a heart-craving dream
Is that a sin?

If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love would love to love you back

If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love will love you back

For just one moment, we all wanna be
Just as happy as one can be
(So don't you make the same mistake)
(You gotta give for what you take)
And don't you break

A little girl or boy crying at home alone
A faithful song will lead the way
To make you strong

If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love would love to love you back

If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love

If you really love
If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love would love to love you back

If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love
Then surely that love
Then ѕurely that love will love you back
Will love you bаck
