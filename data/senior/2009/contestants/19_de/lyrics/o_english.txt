Miss Kiss Kiss Bang

Hey Miss Kiss, let us dance

Mrs Kiss Kiss Bang, she's not a fool
Extraordinary and oh so cool
When I feel the touch of her sweet lips
I know this is a devil's kiss

She sets my soul on fire with no return
Ooh baby, just burn, burn, burn
And I think we're like Mr and Mrs Right
So I'll give you my heart tonight

Miss Kiss Kiss Bang, come let us sing
Miss Kiss Kiss Bang, now let us swing
Shake your sweet, sweet, sweet little thing
Mrs Kiss Kiss Bang, come let us swing

When I look into her eyes the flames grow higher
I know this is a kiss of fire
Imagination feeds my hungry heart
Gimme your love before we part

And I'm on the way of no return
Ooh baby, just burn, burn, burn
And I think we're like Mr and Mrs Right
So I'll give you my heart tonight

Miss Kiss Kiss Bang, come let us sing
Miss Kiss Kiss Bang, now let us swing
Shake your sweet, sweet, sweet little thing
Mrs Kiss, come on and let us sing

Do the skiddly buffely boodely bump (Sing skiddly buffely boodely bump)

Now shake your sweet, sweet sexy thing

Miss Kiss Kiss Bang, come and let us sing

You are my queen and I'm your king
