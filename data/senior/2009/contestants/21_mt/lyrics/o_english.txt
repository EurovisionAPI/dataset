What If We

Words of wisdom, prophets and quotes
Wise men talking, tales from the old
I reach for the stars, wherever they are, in darkness
We're lost, fading away

What if we could be free?
Mystify our wisdom in time
And one day we'll see
What if we found the key?
Throw the dice, unravel our lies
And learn how to be

All the madness feeding our soul
Take a wild guess out of control
There will be a star, no matter how far, shining
One day we'll sail away

What if we could be free?
Mystify our wisdom in time
And one day we'll see
What if we found the key?
Throw the dice, unravel our lies
And learn how to be

If you don't know your destination
Who determines your destiny?

What if we could be free?
Mystify our wisdom in time
And one day we'll see
What if we found the key?
Throw the dice, unravel our lieѕ
And leаrn how to be
