Just get out of my life

Everybody's sayin' your love is like a prison
Everybody's tryin' to help me to come free
Everybody's talkin' 'bout all the things I'm missin'
And for all them reasons I must agree

It's too dangerous when we touch
And I love you much too much
Get out of my life, babe

Just get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my bed
It's beyond belief, but true
I became a slave to you

Just get out of my, out of my, out of my dreams
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my scenes
Where I lose all of my drive
While I'm fighting to survive

Just get out of my life
Get out of my life

Well, you are like a moonbeam that makes me feel so lonely
You are like a mountain and I'm afraid to fall
Every time I'm certain you are my one and only
I know if you leave me, I'll lose it all

'Cause you're overwhelming me
You're too perfect, can't you see?
Please, get out of my life

Just get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my bed
It's beyond belief, but true
I became a slave to you

Just get out of my, out of my, out of my dreams
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my scenes
Where I lose all of my drive
While I'm fighting to survive
Just get out of my life

Because I love you
More than you will ever know
Would be hard to let you go
But get out of my life
Get out of my life

It's beyond belief, but true
I became a slave to you

Just get out of my, out of my, out of my dreams
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my scenes
Where I lose all of my drive
While I'm fighting to survive

Just get out of my life
Get out of my way, hey…
Or just ѕtаy
