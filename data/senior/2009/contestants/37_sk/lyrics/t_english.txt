Fly through the darkness

I feel cold, deceitful shadows
The desire sparked at the bottom
A void in the soul becoming
A taste of bitter, a taste of dark

We must come out of the shadows, intrigues and words
Give your heart, don't despair, and fly through the darkness

I also feel it, I am also afraid
The dream is trembling with my fear
Moments of loss, moments of fear
When hopes roll in dust

We have to come out of the shadows, of intrigues and words
Give your heart, don't despair, and fly through the darkness
We have to come out of the shadows, of intrigues and words
Give your heart, don't despair, and fly through the darkness

But where to?
I don't know, at this moment, every instance is a mistake
Silence whispers in me: don't stay alone

I also feel it, I am also afraid
Don't stay alone

As forgiveness approaches
Clouds embrace the return
Do not stray, you're the same
Even if someone breaks you

Lord, may Your voice lead us
Through the darkness in us
Give us a gift, work a wonder, return love
Love, please

Love, please, may your voice lead us
Through the darkness in us
Give us a gift, work a wonder, stand by us

Love, please, may your voice lead us
Through the darkness in us
Give us a gift, work a wonder, stаnd by uѕ
Keep the love
