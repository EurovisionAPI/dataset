Eyes That Never Lie

I was wandering alone
I was turning to stone
I was going insane
When you came into my life

You chased sorrow away
You changed night into day
You cured all of my pain
With your eyes that never lie

All my life I waited
Thinking I would never fly
Then you looked and saw my wings
With your eyes that never lie

You are my desert and well
You are my heaven and hell
You are my reason to be
My love song, my battle cry

I know I will be whole
While I keep in my soul
The light shining on me
From your eyes that never lie

All my life I waited
Thinking I would never fly
Then you looked and saw my wings
With your eyes that never lie

Oh, my darling angel
Guide me through this barren sky
If I'm lost I'll see the way
In your eyeѕ thаt never lie
