The Voice

Can you keep a secret?
Can you keep a secret?
I'm in love with you
Can you make a promise?
Can you make a promise?
Stay forever true, oh…
Then I'm forever yours

I love you, my love, when I hear the voice
I love you, my life is never without you
I live my life for you, it's the universe for me
I love you, my love, when I hear the voice

Tell me what you're feelin'
Tell me what you're feelin'
I just wanna know
Tell me what you're dreamin'
Tell me what you're dreamin'
Let your feelings show, oh…
Stay and don't let go

I love you, my love, when I hear the voice
I love you, my life is never without you
I live my life for you, it's the universe for me
I love you, my love, when I hear the voice

(I love you, my love, when I hear the voice)
(I love you, my life is never without you)
I live my life for you, it's the univerѕe for me
I love you, my love, when I hear the voice
I hear the voice, the voice
(I love you, my love, when I heаr the voice)
