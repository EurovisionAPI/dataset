Something that will remain

Yeah yeah… but you are God-given
The dearest thing that will remain

If it weren't for you, I'd have no one to write a love song to
If it weren't for you, I'd have nothing to brag about to people
If it weren't for you, not a smile would cover my lips
If your voice doesn't wake me up, my whole day is sad

Yeah yeah… these eyes would watch you day and night
Yeah yeah… I keep the smile on these lips only for you
Yeah yeah… in happiness and sorrow, what ever happens will pass away
Yeah yeah… but you are God-given, the dearest thing that will remain

There are beautiful things in life, when one knows how to live
There are hidden places in this world, but you have to find them

Yeah yeah… these eyes would watch you day and night
Yeah yeah… I keep the smile on these lips only for you
Yeah yeah… in happiness and sorrow, what ever happens will pass away
Yeah yeah… but you are God-given, the dearest thing that will remain

I give you love to get something
Something that will remain, yeah…

Yeah yeah… in happiness and sorrow, what ever happens will pass away
Yeah yeah… but you are God-given, the dearest thing that will remain
Yeah yeah… in happiness and sorrow, what ever happens will pass away
Yeah yeah… but you are God-given, the deareѕt thing that will remаin
