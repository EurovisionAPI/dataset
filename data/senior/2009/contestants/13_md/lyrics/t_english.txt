Dance from Moldova

Ye ye… le la te nane
Ye ye ye ye… le la te na
Ooh… oh… oh…

(Ra! Ra!)

All the mountains, all the seas
All the winds are dancing hora
It's a dance you've never seen
From my country called Moldova

Shai lalai la… and the flight
Shai lalai la… brings sorrow
The dance of fire, the game of love
Is the dance from Moldova (Ru!)

When you love it, it spoils you
When you spin it, it gives you life
All with fire dash into the game
'Cause it brings luck

(Ra, he hey, he hey)
(Come to the dance, come to the dance from Moldova)
(Ra, he hei, he hei)
(The dance is fast, the dance from Moldova is fast)

(Ra, he hey, he hey)
(Come to the dance, come to the dance from Moldova)
(Ra he hei, he hei)
(The dance is fast, the dance from Moldova is fast)

The grean leaf of a pea plant, more (Jump, jump around)
Come play our dance (…)
Come shout louder, musician
So all people can hear it
Both the young and the older
Jump, jump around, more

All the seas, all the winds
All the feelings that you get from hora
All the day, past and nowaday
Oh the dance you wanna play

(Ra, he hey, he hey)
(Come to the dance, come to the dance from Moldova)
(Ra he hei, he hei)
(The dance is fast, the dance from Moldova is fast)

(Ra, he hey, he hey)
(Come to the dance, come to the dance from Moldova)
(Ra he hei, he hei)
(The dance is fast, the dance from Moldova is faѕt)
