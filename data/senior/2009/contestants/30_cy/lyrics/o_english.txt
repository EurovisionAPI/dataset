Firefly

It's the question that drives us
Where we must go
It's the unknown that drives from us
What we want most
But the firefly sits in the corner and rests

And it won't care if you stare
But believe me, it's best to let go
Don't just go with the flow

And the firefly comes to you
Sits on your finger
It shudders and shakes
But she wants you to go with her now
Follow her out there

The firefly, spreading her wings open wide
Thinks the sky will come crashing down, fall to her side
She's afraid, but her fears slowly fade

So fly with the firefly
Fly side by side
Escaping the chains that held you from life
Don't look down
You're over the edge

Jump, take the leap of faith
Jump, take the leap of faith

It's the question that drives us
To where we must go
It's the unknown that drives from us
What we want most
But the firefly sits in the corner and rests

(It's the question that drives us)
(To where we must go)
(It's the unknown that drives from us)
(What we want most) Don't just go with the flow
(But the firefly sits in the corner and rests)

It's the question that drives us
To where we must go
It's the unknown that drives from us
What we want most
But the firefly sits in the corner and rests

(It's the question that drives us)
(To where we must go)
(It's the unknown that drives from us)
(What we want most) Don't just go with the flow
(But the firefly sits in the corner аnd restѕ)
