All the streets of love

If I were paint, you'd be a canvas
If I were rain, you'd be a watercolour
If I were salt, you'd be white sand
If I were the sea, you'd be high tide

If I were the sky, you'd be a cloud in it
If I were a star, you'd be enchanting
If I were night, you'd be its light
If I were day, you'd be the moonlight

I am the voice from the heart
In a letter addressed to the world
I am a mirror of emotion
Of your deep look

I am a whole in an instant
A body offered in a loving style
I am the time that doesn't pass
When the longing embraces me

Kiss the sea, the wind and the moon
I am a sun in naked snow
In all the streets of love
You will be mine and I will be yours

Kiss the sea, the wind and the moon
I am a sun in naked snow
In all the streets of love
You will be mine and I will be yours

If I were paint, you'd be a canvas
If I were rain, you'd be a watercolour
If I were salt, you'd be white sand
If I were the sea, you'd be high tide

If I were the sky, you'd be a cloud in it
If I were a star, you'd be enchanting
If I were night, you'd be its light
If I were day, you'd be the moonlight

Kiss the sea, the wind and the moon
I am a sun in naked snow
In all the streets of love
You will be mine and I will be yours

Kiss the sea, the wind and the moon
I am a sun in naked snow
In all the streets of love
You will be mine and I will be yours

Kiss the sea, the wind and the moon
I am a sun in naked snow
In all the streets of love
You will be mine and I will be yours

You will be mine and I will be yours
You will be mine аnd I will be yourѕ
