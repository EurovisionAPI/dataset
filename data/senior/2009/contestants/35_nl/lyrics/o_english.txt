Shine

(Shine, shine, shine)

There are so many wars right now in this world
There are so many things not right
There are too many people hurt in this world
There are too many men that fight

Time is now to make the change
Time is on our side
Love will make us glow in the dark
So open up your heart
Are you ready for a brand new start?

(Shine)
People, let your light shine
Let the darkness fade away
Step into a brighter day
Don't forget about our world today

Let your light shine
Maybe the answer is just this simple song
Let everybody shine along
To keep the world from going wrong
Let your light shine

So many people with good heart in this world
So many, they can make a change
So the only thing that we have to do
Is love the one we hate

It will change all darkness into bright
It will touch everybody's light
The whole world will be lighted
All people will be reunited

(Shine)
People, let your light shine
Let the darkness fade away
Step into a brighter day
Don't forget about the role you must play

Let your light shine
Maybe the answer is just this simple song
Let everybody shine along
To keep the world from going wrong
Let your light shine

As long as we believe in good in each man
As long as we believe in love
The light will guide and take us to
The world we all dream of
Let your light shine

(Shine)
People, let your light shine
Maybe the answer is just this simple song
Let everybody shine аlong
To keep the world from going wrong
Let your light shine

Shine, shine, shine, ѕhine
