I don't wanna leave

I can't say the words I feel inside so deep
'Cause when the clouds come out, I feel so incomplete
I know the sun shines down on me
I see it now, the rain won't get to me
I just wanna live my life the way it's meant to be

I don't wanna leave, but it's my destiny
I will wrap my arms around the world
You'll see that I am not a child
'Cause I'm standing taller this time
Take it step by step, do my best, that's right
But I will never say goodbye

For so long now I've been dreaming in the dark
I was too scared to feel the things held in my heart
Don't you know this is meant to be, I'll let it out
'Cause it's getting hard to breathe
I just wanna live my life the way it's meant to be

I don't wanna leave, but it's my destiny
I will wrap my arms around the world
You'll see that I am not a child
'Cause I'm standing taller this time
Take it step by step, do my best, that's right
Oh… I don't wanna leave, I don't wanna leave
But it's my destiny, oh…

I'll never say goodbye…
(Never say, never say, never say goodbye)
Never, oh…
(Never say, never say)

I don't wanna leave, but I'm standing taller this time
Take it step by step, do my best, that's right
But I will never ѕаy goodbye
