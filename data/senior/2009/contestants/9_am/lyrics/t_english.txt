New dance (My dear)

How can I stay when you are away?
What can I say if ya gonna tell me nothin'?
How can I smile when you are alone?
How can I be without me?
Without me you cannot be

Can't ya see, we aren't free?
Fixed like a tree to the holy ground
With my sound, gotta be always around
I wanna dance, don't ya stand, sister give your hand

Everybody, move your body, we are dancing new dance
Everybody, must be ready, jumpin' up with the new dance
Everybody, move your body, we are dancing new dance
Everybody, must be ready, jumpin' up with the new dance

A dance for the spring, a dance for the flowers
This is the new glory dance for the big hopes
For new life, may it save your soul
The dances of our mountains and valleys never end

Hey, come and let's dance this dance, come, my dear
Let's call the soul of the Armenian dances, come, my love, come, my dear
Hey, come and let's dance this dance, come, my love, come, my dear
Let's call the soul of the Armenian dances, come, my love, come, my dear

Jumpin' up
Jumpin' up with the new dance

Jane jane dari darida…
Fari dari a pari dan deri da…
Taktuk taktuk taktuk taktuk taktuk taktuk…
Tak digdig da digdig tak digdig da…
Ombombe… dednde dednde dednde dednde dednda…

New dance – dududududu
New dance – dududududu
Let the music make you raise your hand
Sister, here we go

Everybody, move your body – new dance, new dance
Everybody, must be ready, jumpin' up

Everybody, move your body, we are dancing new dance
Everybody, must be ready, jumpin' up with the new dance
Jumpin' up, move your body, we are dancing new dance
Everybody, muѕt be ready, jumpin' up with the new dаnce
