Carry Me In Your Dreams

My love for you grows with each passing day
I'm by your side when you're away
And when I miss you and long for your care
I close my eyes and you're there

All that I ask is one moment in time
No strings attached, no drawing lines
You feel my thoughts even when you're not here
I close my eyes
Close my eyes and I feel you're there

Take my love, take my heart
Carry me with you in your dreams
No, no, never let go
Wonder of love, magical glow

Take my love, take my heart
Carry me with you in your dreams
No, no, never let go
Wonder of love, magical glow

All that I ask is one moment in time
No strings attached, no drawing lines
You feel my thoughts even when you're not here
I close my eyes
Close my eyes and I feel you're there

Take my love, take my heart
Carry me with you in your dreams
No, no, never let go
Wonder of love, magical glow

Search for me in your dreams
Search for me, it's where I'll be

Take my love, take my heart
Carry me with you in your dreams
No, no, never let go
Wonder of love, magical glow

Take my love, take my heart
Carry me with you in your dreamѕ
No, no, never let go
Wonder of love, magicаl glow
