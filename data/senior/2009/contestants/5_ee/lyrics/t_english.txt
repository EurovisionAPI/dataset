The nomads

In the desert heat the sand
Blows like ice-cold snow
The night soon unfurls its wings
Leaving nothing but the wind to escort the nomads

This is the way
They wander from one day to the next
This is the way
They wander from one time to the next
This is the way
It weaves an invisible path
Before them
Waiting until you dare to take the risk

It conveys only frozen souls
The moonlight makes shadows of them
Warmth in a ray of sunlight
Is what the morning brings once again

This is the way
They wander from one day to the next
This is the way
They wander from one time to the next
This is the way
It weaves an invisible path
Before them
Waiting until you dare to take the risk

They wander from one day to the next
They wander from one time to the next
It weaves an invisible path
It waits until you are ready to take the risk

A voice echoes over the mountains up to the heavens

This is the way
They wander from one day to the next
This is the way
They wander from one time to the next
This is the way
It weaves an invisible path
Before them
Waiting until you dare to take the risk
