And if it had to be done

If it had to be done, I would stop the earth
I would turn off the light so you stay asleep
If it had to be done to please you, listening to you every night
When you speak of love, I would speak of it too

So you still look into the depth of my eyes
So you still see in there the greatest of great fires
And so your hand clings to my skin where it wants to
If you run off one day, I would follow if I could

And if it had to be done, I would push away the winter
With big help of springtime and long clear mornings
If it had to be done to please you, I would stop the time
So all your words of yesterday stay with me now

So I still look into the blue of your eyes
So your two hands still get lost in my hair
I will do everything bigger and if it's too much or too little
I would be wrong all the time, if that's what you want

I do want to give everything, if only you believe in it
My heart does want to bleed, if only you see it
Until being nothing more but the shadow of your nights
Until being nothing more but a shadow that followѕ you

And if it hаd to be done
