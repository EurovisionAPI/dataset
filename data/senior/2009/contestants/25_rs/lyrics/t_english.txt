The shoe

My old shoe has seen half the world
Wherever I treaded was my home
Here and there, East and West
Wherever I came, I felt at my place

I'm starting to panic, this old habit
My heart would follow her
Yet I'm a fool, an old raff
Let everything perish, I'll stick to my path

She didn't, didn't, didn't want me
Until I had the money
No bro, she didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't desire me
Until I became rich
Completely
