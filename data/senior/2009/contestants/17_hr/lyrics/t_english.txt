Beautiful Tena

I was a cloud, floating
And I haven't seen the sun
I was waiting for you

God has sent you to me
Detached you from his heart, so I could live
And waited for you to give me the miracle of love

Hey darling, hey darling
You're turning tears into cotton
You're a sight for sore eyes
You enchant

Hey beauty, hey holy
You're turning water into wine
You're praying for all of us, for all of us

Tena… Tena…

Tena… Tena…
Tena, Tena, Tenа…
