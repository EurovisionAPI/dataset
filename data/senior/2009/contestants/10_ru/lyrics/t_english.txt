Mum

Out of the shadows once again, my enemy, my love
Inevitable is my destiny, no matter how much you're prepared
But before you left, with golden ring
You engaged to me and didn't save me from sorcery
And didn't let my soul be free

Mum, and you've been telling me not to desire
Mum, and at that time I didn't know where trouble was
Mum, and you've been telling me that time is like water
Mum, Mum, Mum, love is trouble

I will throw away my dream and crush it on the floor
How you've broken my destiny and left it on the side
I will pour out girl's tears like rain

Mum, and you've been telling me not to desire
Mum, and at that time I didn't know where trouble was
Mum, and you've been telling me that time is like water
Mum, Mum, Mum, love is trouble

Mum, and at that time I didn't know where trouble is
Mum, and you've been telling me that time is like wаter
Mum, Mum, Mum, love iѕ trouble
