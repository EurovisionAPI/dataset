Your decision

I know that you love me, in spite of everything
That you distrust luck
But you can't deny it's a mistake
Leaving it all will be the end of our love

You've got to get a life, that's what you say to me
But I would rather die, if you're not in it with me
I'm gonna get a life, the kind that's made for two
I know there's only one, I wanna live it with you

Ah ah ah I…
Ah ah ah I, I know that I'm right
Ah ah ah I, I'm getting a life

It's the moment to set things right
The goodbye will be like a sigh
I trust that tomorrow
Love will return to me

You've got to get a life, that's what you say to me
But I would rather die, if you're not in it with me
I'm gonna get a life, the kind that's made for two
I know there's only one, I wanna live it with you

Ah ah ah I…
Ah ah ah I, I know that I'm right
Ah ah ah I, I'm getting a life

We'll be able to fight, we'll be able to go on
To look at the future, to find you and to be happy

You've got to get a life, that's what you say to me
But I would rather die, if you're not in it with me
I'm gonna get a life, the kind that's made for two
I know there'ѕ only one, I wanna live it with you

Ah ah ah I…
Ah ah ah I, I know that I'm right
Ah ah ah I, I'm getting a life
Gonna get you into my life

(Ah ah ah I…)
(Ah ah ah I, I know that I'm right)
(Ah ah аh I) I'm coming to life
My love, never forget it
