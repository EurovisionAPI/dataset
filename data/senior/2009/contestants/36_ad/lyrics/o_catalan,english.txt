La teva decisió

Sé que m'estimes, malgrat tot
Que desconfies de la sort
Però no pots negar, és un error
Deixar-ho tot serà la fí del nostre amor

You've got to get a life, that's what you say to me
But I would rather die, if you're not in it with me
I'm gonna get a life, the kind that's made for two
I know there's only one, I wanna live it with you

Ah ah ah I…
Ah ah ah I, I know that I'm right
Ah ah ah I, I'm getting a life

És el moment de corregir
L'adéu serà com un sospir
Confio a què l'endemà
L'amor tornarà a mi

You've got to get a life, that's what you say to me
But I would rather die, if you're not in it with me
I'm gonna get a life, the kind that's made for two
I know there's only one, I wanna live it with you

Ah ah ah I…
Ah ah ah I, I know that I'm right
Ah ah ah I, I'm getting a life

Sabrem lluitar, sabrem seguir
Mirar al futur, trobar-te i ser feliç

You've got to get a life, that's what you say to me
But I would rather die, if you're not in it with me
I'm gonna get a life, the kind that's made for two
I know there's only one, I wanna live it with you

Ah ah ah I…
Ah ah ah I, I know that I'm right
Ah ah ah I, I'm getting a life
Gonna get you into my life

(Ah ah ah I…)
(Ah ah ah I, I know that I'm right)
(Ah ah ah I) I'm coming to life
Amor meu, no ho oblidiѕ mаi
