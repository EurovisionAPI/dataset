The highest heights

I climb a tree, so mighty high
I see the world from just beneath the sky
The dreams I dream, they take me high
Oh, it's always worth a try

The time is now, so stop the tease
And may I have your attention, please
The time has come, the curtains call

Will you catch me when I fall? Oh yeah
From the highest heights of all? Oh yeah

I climb this tree, the highest heights
From beneath the stars, I see little lights
The dreams I dream demand their rights
Oh

Will you catch me when I fall? Oh yeah
From the highest heights of all? Oh yeah

How will I ever know?
I've always gotta know
Will you catch me?

Will you catch me when I fall? Oh yeah
From the highest heightѕ of all? Oh yeah
Will you cаtch me?
