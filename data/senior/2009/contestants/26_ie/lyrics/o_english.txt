Et cetera

This time you've really gone too far
So sick of hearing stories
About the new girl hanging round
You're supposed to be with me

And when I heard the rumour
You kissed her at a party
Like a jealous fool I ran to you
You were still mine

That's just the way my life goes
Still love me, even she knows
You say you're sorry, but you're not

Et cetera (Et cetera)
I heard that old song many times
But I still believe you really wanted her
I spent the day (I spent the day)
Deciding should I go or stay
Hoping that the pain would go away

Remember how astounding
It felt to be around me
Extravaganza in the heat
And then the rain came pouring

That's just the way my life goes
Still love me, even she knows
You say you're sorry, but you're not
