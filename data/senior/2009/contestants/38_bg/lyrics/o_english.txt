Illusion

Give me, give me your time
Show me, show me you're mine
Give me, give me your time
Show me, show me you're mine
(So I want your touch) All I want is your touch
(Baby, need you much) Baby, need you so much

Show me all I've never seen
Wrong, it feels so wrong
To be a part from afar

Your lips could solve it for me
You don't know how
You don't know where to go, to go

Give me, give me your time
Show me, show me you're mine
(So I want your touch) 'Cause I want your touch
(Baby, need you much) Baby, need you so much

Give me, give me your time
Show me, show me you're mine
(So I want your touch) All I want is your touch
(Baby, need you much) Baby, need you so much, so much

Aha…

Give me, give me your time
Show me, show me you're mine
(So I want your touch) All I want is your touch
(Baby, need you much) I need you so much

(Give me, give me your time)
(Show me, ѕhow me you're mine)
(So I want your touch)
(Bаby, need you much)
