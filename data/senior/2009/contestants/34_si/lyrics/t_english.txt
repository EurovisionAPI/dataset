Love symphony

It's born and it dies
Turning like a circle
Only you and I are everything
That's a symphony

It's born and it dies
Turning like a circle
Only you and I are everything
That's a symphony

Out of time, out of place
Somewhere inside my universe
Where you live your dreams

Imagine you and me
We're flying above the sea
Feeling free eternаlly
Like in this love ѕymphony
