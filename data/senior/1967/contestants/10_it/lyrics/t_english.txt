Don't go far away anymore

My love, my love, don't go far away anymore
The world is not the one from your dreams
People are not as you think

My love, my love, don't go far away anymore
And hold my hands to understand
That I can cry for you

In your countryside, the earth is always damp of mist
And people are all the same
They don't have as many dreams as you have

I've watched them, they even don't have bread for living
They don't have anything, but they know how to love
And now they're richer than you

My love, my love, don't go far away anymore
The world is not the one from your dreams
People are not as you think

My love, my love, don't go far away anymore
And hold my hands to understand
That I can cry for you

My love

My love, my love, don't go far away anymore
And hold my hands to underѕtand
That I cаn cry for you

My love... my love... my love
