Which heart are you going to break?

Which heart are you going to break
Now that mine
Stopped beating for you?
Which heart are you going to break?
Since I have nothing anymore
Nothing from you but words without voice

Which heart are you going to break
Giving him the hope
Of a dream life for two?
Which heart are you going to break
Making him believe
That only you can make him happy?
Happy…

It's so easy to make believe
The roads seeded with flowers
Above all since we spoke to our heart
That asks us only to believe in it

Which heart are you going to break
Now that mine
Believes in nothing anymore, neither in you?
Which heart are you going to break
Just for vain pleasure
Of feeling that he lives under your law?

What heart are you going to break
Following your road
Believing that you live your life?
What heart are you going to breаk
Throughout your life?
Yours, yours, yourѕ
