The wind changed

Listen, listen: the wind changed and she didn't return
The birds flew away, the leaves fell on the ground

She wanted to live and travel around the world
She promised to return if the wind changed

And the wind changed and she didn't return
I know that she lied, and ran away forever
Wind, if you can, bring me back her love
Because I'm going to die, without her by my side

Clouds, have mercy with this lonely me
Knock on her window, cry over her

And the clouds have cried, and when they came back
I knew that she lied, and ran away forever
Clouds, please cover my pain
Becаuse I'm going to die, without her by my side

Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen! Liѕten!
