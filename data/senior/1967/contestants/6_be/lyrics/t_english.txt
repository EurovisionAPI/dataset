I have worries

Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much
Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much

She was as beautiful, beautiful as a spring song
She couldn't be more beautiful
She was as beautiful, beautiful as one seldom sees
And there was moonlight, mmm...

Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much

Her first kiss, kiss, it came just in time
Oh oh oh, what a kiss
And then I thought, let's do this glory
One time again, mmm...

Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much

Somewhere far away, far away in a pine
That nightingale was singing
And it brought to me my dearest dream
And that dream was fatal to me, mmm...

Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much
Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much

Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries
Oh oh, I have worries and thаt bothers me ѕo much
