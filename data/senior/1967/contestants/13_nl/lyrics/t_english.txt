Ring-ding

This will be a ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-a-ding day
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day

When I feel like singing out loud
Jumping through the house and the streets
When a street musician, very elegantly
Bows to me with hat in hand

When I feel like drinking vodka in the morning
And clinking spontaneously with the baker
Well, then it's no question:
Today will be again a day without one dissonance

This will be a ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-a-ding day
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day

When I laugh about a hand full of blanks
And when I want to shoot the weathercock off the tower
With a water cannon, in a balloon
When I float through the air and frolick with the sun

When I feel that I can party for hours
And exchange the less for the most
Now, then it's no question
Today I make a bid for a big carillon

This will be a ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-a-ding day
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day

When I'm going to call a minister
To tell the joke of the day
When I dance, when I swing, ask for noise
Well, then I found my niche

When I want to hire a beat group for the evening
For a solemn dinner with the neighbours
When everyone laughs then, I'll say tonight:
"This day was again endlessly fine"

This was a ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-a-ding day
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day

This waѕ a ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ding-a-ding day
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day

Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding
Ring ding-a-ding-a-ding dаy
