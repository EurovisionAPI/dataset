All the flowers of this world

A shot just to salute
And to say goodbye and off he went into night
Buried in the middle of the grass, he lies here
Where he fell down without a word on his lips

I'm waiting for spring
I can sense the tender palms of my dear
I feel the caress of my hair and some words
Without words among the grass
When the spring is here

<i style="color:#789">Why does the sound of the trumpet reminds me of those
Who don't have the right words in their mouths?</i>

Why do all these flowers
Lie and fester in the middle of the field?
So that all these people would
Anticipate the time
And the spring that for аll comeѕ
Only once
