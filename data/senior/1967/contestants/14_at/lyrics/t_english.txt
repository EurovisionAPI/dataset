Why are there a hundred thousand stars

Why are there a hundred thousand stars
At night in the deep blue sky?
Why does someone often love someone else
Much more than anything else in the world?

Why do millions of flowers bloom
And does the sun shine for the poor and rich?
Is youth and dying
Here on earth equal for everyone?

What ever is destined for you
Take it as your destiny
Perhaps your heart realizes
This way, the real sense of life

Why are there a hundred thousand stars
At night in the deep blue sky?
Why are there always miracles?
Holds a heart often truely to another heart?

Why does also for the poor the springtime come
Often more beautiful than for the rich?
Because for God in heaven
Yes, everybody on earth is equal
Because for God in heaven
Yes, everybody on earth iѕ equаl
