Let's talk about love

Let's talk about love
One more time
It's all the truth in our life
Let's stop the hours and the days for a moment
And let's talk about love one more time

Let's talk about my love
And about your love
About the first time we looked to each other
Give me your hands and let's talk together in the shadow
About love one more time

What does it matter? What does it matter?
All those people that look at the earth
And see nothing more but earth
What does it matter? What does it matter?
All those people coming and going
Along the world without seeing the truth

Let's talk about my love
And about your love
About the first time that we looked to each other
Give me your hands and let's talk together in the shadow
About love one more time

What does it matter? What does it matter?
All those people that look at the earth
And see nothing more but earth
What does it matter? What does it matter?
All those people coming and going
Along the world without seeing...

What does it matter?
Let's not pay attention to anyone
And let'ѕ talk аbout love
About our love
