To the shadow – to safety

Into the shadow from under the burning sun
I must get into the shadow from the street of pain
To safety from under the glowing sky
To safety, to a green oasis

Above is the shining sun, underneath is the burning ground
In the mind the shady resort, where I can go by myself

Into the shadow from under the burning sun
I must soon get away, into the shadow
To safety from under the glowing sky
To safety under bushy leaves

Into the shadow from the shameless spotlights
I want to get into the shadow, away from the company of the famous
To safety, away from the burning love
To safety of silent longing

My life is just restless, now I have to stand everything
I already got enough fame, rest is all I miss

I want to get into the shadow, away from the spotlights
Into the shadow, although it would be lonely there
I want to go to the peaceful safety, eventually
That's when I could finally find my hаppinesѕ
