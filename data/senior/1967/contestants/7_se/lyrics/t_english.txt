Like a dream

Like a dream of paradise
In a dream and through the mist of tears
I've searched for an answer

Like a dream through the lights of the night
I felt, like the gentle sound of wings
Your hand against my cheek

You and I, we search the same answers
So hesitantly without knowing where to look
Give me your hand, and our dream will come true
Give me your hand

Like a dream is my life with you
In my dream, you are everything to me
And the answers of my dreams

In my dream of eternity
I have now found a reality
Yes, you are the answer to my dreams

You and I, we search the same answers
So heѕitantly without knowing where to look
Give me your hand, and our dream will come true
Give me your hаnd
