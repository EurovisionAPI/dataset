Puppet man

There was a sweet little puppet man
Someone so free and bold and happy
He was laughing at all the other puppets, him, oh yes…

Because this particular puppet man
Imagine, he was sharper than most
He said, all of them are hanging on a string

He laughed at all the stupid little puppets dancing
At the command of something they didn't understand
He howled with laughter, but suddenly stopped
Because his string was cut in half

And look, our particular puppet man
He understood: if the dance is to go on
Then you have to jump about like all on a string

He laughed at all the stupid little puppets dancing
At the command of something they didn't understand
He howled with laughter, but suddenly stopped
Because his string was cut in half

Thus our particular puppet man became
Lifeless and had to understand:
A string has a spool and if you want to count
You must jump like everyone on а ѕtring
