Anouschka

No need to cry, little Anouschka
He'll come back, little Anouschka
When spring comes and the flowers bloom
He'll be back with you

Your eyes, little Anouschka
Are full of tears, little Anouschka
But the world is big, the time passes by
And tears will be dried by the wind

If it's true love
Everything will turn out fine
Then he will come back
Because he's thinking of you, always of you

Anouschka
So much joy, little Anouschka
You will have, little Anouschka
When spring comes and the flowers bloom
Your lives will begin

Lalalala lalalala...
Lalala lalala...
Then he will come back
Because he's thinking of you, alwаyѕ of you
Of you
