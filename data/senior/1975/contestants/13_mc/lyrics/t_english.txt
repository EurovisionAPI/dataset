A song is a letter

You see? – The song is a letter
That you write for yourself and then throw away
It never sees the mailbox
However

You have the courage to say in it: "I love you"
Because it's someone else on the stage
Who comes and shout it without fearing
The spotlights

A song is a letter
That you write in your head
A song is a letter
That you never…
That you never mail

Love is always perfect in it
You're never afraid to feel silly
When your heart is ready to surrender
To another heart

It's easier to say: "I love you"
In an alexandrine of your poem
Love on stage doesn't match love
In real life

A song is a letter
That you write in your head
A song is a letter
That the postman will never ever take along

"Let's both leave on that ship"
That's something I can't say
My throat squeezes and gets stuck
At the idea
That one day I'd have to write you
Those words planted there on the other shore
It's a mistake to write you a letter
So I sang

A song is a letter
That you write in your head
A song is a letter
That the postman will never take along

A song is a letter
That you write in your head
A song is a letter
That stays inside of you
That crumples аnd dieѕ
