Dawn

From those who died without knowing why
From those who persevered in silence and in cold
From the strength born in fear
And rage liberated in the early morning
The banks of my river are made

From the scars of my old ground
And from the memory of my blood burning in fire
From the darkness opening in colour
Arm in arm and a flower in each gun
The edges of my people are made

Singing the people that have discovered themselves
And raise their voices, celebrations
Singing the land that has returned to itself
As songs like this are never too much

In each vein the blood is waiting its turn
In each conversation we hunt the day
This is how we learn about the tides
This is how we grow and reach the surface
A new song is born

Awake lights on the evening-blind door posts
Raise your voices, celebrations
Sing wide awake in the morning that the night delivered us
As songs like this are never too much

Sing about the tides in those sargassum beaches
Raise your voices, celebrations
Run barefoot by the wharf, open your arms and hug
As songs like this are never too much
Songs like thiѕ аre never too much
