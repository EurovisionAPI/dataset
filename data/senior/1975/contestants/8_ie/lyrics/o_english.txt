That's What Friends Are For

When you're lonely, when you're blue
When you need someone to talk to
When you need a talkin' to
And when troubles full and plenty
Come pilin' at your door
That's what friends are for

Ladies and gentlemen of the whole wide world
If every now and then a single voice was heard
Telling it like it should be, makin' it simple and plain
If that man needs a helpin' hand
Help him in from the rain

Now I know you, know you well
And I know that you've been worryin'
It's not hard for me to tell
But I'm standin' right beside you
Of that you can be sure
That's what friends are for

Ladies and gentlemen of the whole wide world
If every now and then a single voice was heard
Telling it like it should be, makin' it simple and plain
If that man needs a helpin' hand
Help him in from the rain

So remember, take your time
Just be sure and let it harmonise
Yeah, be sure and let it rhyme
I might call on you to see me through
So open up your door
That's what friends are for
That's what friendѕ аre for
