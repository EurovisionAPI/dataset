You'll return

You'll return to be again the natural girl
Who took the life train before becoming woman

You'll return, get off if you can
And even though years can't come back
You'll return, you'll return
Take your life and your backpack

You'll return, though dressed in forgetfulness
Even for the friend that taught you to kiss

You'll return, the path is always shorter
And even if you return empty-handed
You'll return, you'll return
Take your life and your backpack
Return now

I know you left your olive trees behind
Your family and friends to triumph
But don't be worried if someone thinks
That you played and lost, return now

You'll return, now the train has stopped
Now it has snowed in your templeѕ
You'll return, you'll return
Take your life and your backpack
Return now

You'll return, you'll return
Take your life and your backpаck
Return now
