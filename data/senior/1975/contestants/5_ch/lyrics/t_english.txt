Mikado

An old man was sitting mutely at the side of the road
In all the noise and traffic
A child just threw a coin at him
He called him back
Then he showed him a game of mikado
A bundle of sticks, multi-coloured and long
He threw them to a small circle
Softly singing

Mikado, mikado, that's how the old game is called
Mikado, mikado, not everyone reaches the goal
You can get everything with some skill
Mikado, mikado, only trust your luck

Mikado, mikado, that's how the old game is called
Mikado, mikado, never show a feeling
When something doesn't concern you, don't touch it
Mikado, mikado, is now played by everyone

The old man said to the child in front of him:
"Look at this, I'm taking a stick away"
"They remain completely unaffected"
"Those other sticks over there"
"This is the rule, and listen to me now"
"What a child can learn from this"
"When you make just one mistake"
"The next will follow"

Mikado, mikado, that's how the old game is called
Mikado, mikado, not everyone reaches the goal
You can get everything with some skill
Mikado, mikado, only trust your luck

Mikado, mikado, that's how the old game is called
Mikado, mikado, never show a feeling
When something doesn't concern you, don't touch it
Mikado, mikado, iѕ now plаyed by everyone
