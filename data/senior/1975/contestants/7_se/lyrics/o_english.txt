Jennie, Jennie

I know that tonight you're alone
In your room with a note in your hand
In your dreams you're regretting
But never forgetting That often, you doubt where you stand

Your phonograph spins out a tune
You see pictures in your memory
I know that you're crying, but there's no denying
That time has a different melody

Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
Can't you see the world is yours?
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
Life has still so much in store to give you
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
You must change your tune somehow
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
Live your life and live it now

You long for the world that you loved
And you want to be there once again
But your diary's confessions
Are like signs that the ocean
Erased forever from the sand

Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
Can't you see the world is yours?
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
Life has still so much in store to give you
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
You must change your tune somehow
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
Live your life and live it now

Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
Can't you see the world is yours?
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
Life has still so much in store to give you
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
You must change your tune ѕomehow
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie
Live your life аnd live it now
