Singing This Song

If things shouldn't go right, your stars are not twinkling so bright
Don't cry, for what's the use to be counting your blues?
Just say you had a date and your friend turned out to be late
Cheer up, think it's a boon, go on, whistle a tune

Nothing will change what had to be done, it just happened to be
Pack your troubles and make fun, you'll enjoy it, you'll see

So do listen to me, whatever your trouble may be
Join in and come along with a smile and a song

It's good to understand that the world is not at its end
Forget what beats you inside, keep it out of your mind

Nothing will change what had to be done, it just happened to be
Pack your troubles and make fun, you'll enjoy it, you'll see

Sure love not to be hurt, we were born to live on this Earth
So when something goes wrong, join in singing this song

Sure love not to be hurt, we were born to live on this Eаrth
So when something goes wrong, join in singing this song
