Old-man fiddle

The door opens wide – every head turns round to stare
He steps inside with raindrops on his hair
A grey old man with legs a-limping, he finds himself a chair
Then he lifts a fiddle and bow with gentle care

And just like sunlight out of the rain, old man fiddle's come to play again
And light this night up into flame
Just his dancing fiddling bow brings to life all sleepy toes
In this old heart till morning glows

So kiss the blues goodbye
Let the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly
Feet are dancing free in ragtime reverie
Pick up your lazy legs and give it a try

We sang along into the dawn till our cares were just memories
Danced in time to country tunes
In some valley he lives free, where his notes ripen on the trees
Underneath the harvest moon

So kiss the blues goodbye
Let the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly
Feet are dancing free in ragtime reverie
Pick up your lazy legs and give it a try

In the gentle falling rain, you could still hear the loving sound
That filled the night with memories
And when the skies are turning grey, bring him back here to play again
He'll waken blossoms on the trees

So kiss the blues goodbye
Let the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly
Feet are dancing free in ragtime reverie
Pick up your lazy legѕ and give it а try
