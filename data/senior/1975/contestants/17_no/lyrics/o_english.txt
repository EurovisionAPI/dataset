Touch My Life with Summer

You came along and touched my life with summertime
And filled my soul with rays of golden sunshine
You made me feel that somethin' real was waiting to be found
Changing my whole style, teaching me to smile

Every day, every way, let me stay in your summer
Summer, stay with me
Keep me warm, summer wine
Keep me warm, summertime

I feel the warmth of summer deep inside of me
And know the glow of love will show and free me
And when you're gone, I'll carry on with what you left in me
Something that will grow, everyone will know

Every day, every way, let me stay in your summer
Summer, stay with me
Keep me warm, summer wine
Keep me wаrm, summertime

I hope you'll be returning when next summer comes
Then we'll be three, together in the summer ѕun
