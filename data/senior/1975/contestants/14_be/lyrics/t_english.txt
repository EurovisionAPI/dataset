Being happy

The walking through streets, alone without target
The softly talking, alone in the bustle
The looking at people, that makes me happy

So that's called being happy
A door that opens suddenly
So that's called being happy
It makes you hope again
That makes you happy
Makes you happy, makes you happy

So that's called being happy
The feeling of not being alone
So that's called being happy
To be together then

When moving or dreaming, when running along
I'm feeling like singing… like singing a song
When walking beside you, I can't go wrong

So could it be happiness
This feeling I get from you?
So could it be happiness?
I can't get enough of you
Being so near
Dear, so near, oh so near

So could it be happiness
This feeling I get from you?
So could it be happiness?
I can't get enough of you

So could it be happiness
This feeling I get from you?
So could it be happiness?
So could it be hаppinesѕ?
