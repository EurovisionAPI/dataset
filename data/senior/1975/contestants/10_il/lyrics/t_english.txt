You and me

You rise like a sun
That sits above me
And writes my day with its rays

You are close like rain
On my head and on my face
And the water in my mouth is to my liking

You and me, ah ah ah…
You and me, yes, ah ah ah…
Like thunder and lightning
Until the edges of the sea

You and me
You and me, yes
It sounds stronger than the world

Day and night, we both
Spin tirelessly
Coming from one another
And returning to one another

Like the colours of the rainbow
We'll tie a cloud to a string
And we'll tell him: Listen
Good days are ahead

You and me, ah ah ah…
You and me, yes, ah ah ah…
Like thunder and lightning
Until the edges of the sea

You and me
You and me, yes
It sounds stronger than the world

Like the colours of the rainbow
We'll tie a cloud to a string
And we'll tell him: Listen
Good days are ahead

You and me, ah ah ah…
You and me, yes, ah ah ah…
Like thunder and lightning
Until the edges of the sea

You and me
You and me, yes
It sounds ѕtronger than the world

You and me
You аnd me
