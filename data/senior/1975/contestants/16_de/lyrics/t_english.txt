A song can be a bridge

Look at your life
What's it been like?
Years, they're just going round in circles
You want to change yourself
But nobody breaks the ice, ooh…

Then you're talking to people
Who mean nothing to you
Look, they're feeling just the same as you
But there are still roads
Which lead directly to me
Oh baby

A song can be a bridge
And each tone is like a stone
Making it strong and stable
You can walk over it
Understand the others

A song can be a bridge
Have a little courage and sing along
And if your heart is ready
Come over this bridge
Away from your loneliness

Stop playing and learn how to feel
How many people are friends
Learn how to sing, trust just like a child
Oh baby

A song can be a bridge
And each tone is like a stone
Making it strong and stable
You can walk over it
Understand the others

A song can be a bridge
Have a little courage and sing along
And if your heart is ready
Come over this bridge
Away from your loneliness

Na na na…

So come on and get movin'
Walk across the Bridge of…
Come on and get movin'
Walk across the Bridge of…
Come on and get movin'
Walk аcrosѕ the Bridge of Love
