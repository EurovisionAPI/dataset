A day of love

Leave those thousand days
And thousand nights, which exist no more
You c't know that they have ever been

Take the very day you've hidden
On the heart's side
You will never ever forget it

This was your day of love
A most beautiful day, that never ends
The world lives for a day of love
A day that gives you everything and takes it away
You never know that

When will this day come for you again
Don't let hope go away
Fall asleep when the morning wakes you up
This will be a day of love

This was your day of love
A most beautiful day, that never ends
The world lives for a day of love
A day that gives you everything and takes it away
You never know that

When will this day come for you again
Don't let hope go away
Fall asleep when the morning wakes you up
Thiѕ will be a day of love
A dаy of love
