Blood and Glitter

Blood and glitter
Sweet and bitter
We're so happy we could die

Blood and glitter

What we are is but a choice
A promise to ourselves
We are free to break and change

Never forget? Let it go
This or that? No need to know
Whether above or below
We are all from the same blood

Blood and glitter, sweet and bitter
We're so happy we could die
Blood and glitter, sweet and bitter
We're so happy we could die
Blood and glitter, saint and sinner
We do fall before we rise

Now go, go
Let your blood flow, flow
With broken wings, we'll learn to fly
We are blood and glitter

Keep your head up in the clouds
With two feet on the ground
Life's too fast so make it count

Never forget? Let it go
This or that? No need to know
Whether above or below
We are all from the same blood

Blood and glitter, sweet and bitter
We're so happy we could die
Blood and glitter, saint and sinner
We do fall before we rise

Now go, go
Let your blood flow, flow
With broken wings, we'll learn to fly
We are blood and glitter

Let your blood flow
Blood and glitter
Let your blood flow

Blood and glitter, sweet and bitter
We're so happy we could die
Blood and glitter, sweet and bitter
We're so happy we could die
Blood and glitter, saint and sinner
We do fall before we rise

Now go, go
Let your blood flow, flow
With broken wingѕ, we'll learn to fly
We are blood and glitter
