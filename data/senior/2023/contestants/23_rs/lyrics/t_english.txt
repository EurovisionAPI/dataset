I Just Wanna Sleep

Baby watch the world on fire
It is all a game to me
I don't wanna choose my fighter
Who's taking control of me?

Hello?
I just wanna sleep
Go to sleep

I just wanna sleep forever
Like it better when I dream
I want to sleep forever
While the world is on fire
I just wanna close my eyes
And just get it over with
I want to sleep forever
While the world is on fire

Night, infinite hours
Devils on my shoulder
I just wanna sleep forever
To beat them that way

Hello?
Game over
(go to sleep)
(I just wanna sleep)

I just wanna sleep forever
Like it better when I dream
I want to sleep forever
While the world is on fire
I just wanna close my eyes
And just get it over with
I want to sleep forever
While the world is on fire

War
Violence
Rage
Virus
Moral sleeps
While the world is on fire

Voice silenced
Guns
Riots
Moral sleeps
While the world is on fire

Go to sleep
(I just wanna sleep)
(I just wannа ѕleep)
