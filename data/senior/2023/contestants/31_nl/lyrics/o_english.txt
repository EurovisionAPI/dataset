Burning Daylight

I don't find any joy anymore
From the same old cycle
Don't know what made me happy before
From all to zero
Where did I go?

Between falling and running
I've been trying to get on my feet in time
I've never been good at crying
Always wanted to be the tough type

I'm sorry I'm just human
I'm losing myself while chasing highs
I'm losing myself while chasing highs
And burning daylight

I don't believe in God anymore
'Cause where did she go?
I don't know what I've been looking for
I guess a hero

Between falling and running
I've been trying to get on my feet in time
I've never been good at crying
Always wanted to be the tough type

I'm sorry I'm just human
I'm losing myself while chasing highs
And burning daylight
I'm scared that I'm falling behind
I'm losing myself while chasing highs
I'm losing myself while chasing highѕ
And burning dаylight

Goodbye old life
Goodbye old life
Goodbye old life
Goodbye old life
Goodbye old life
Goodbye old life
