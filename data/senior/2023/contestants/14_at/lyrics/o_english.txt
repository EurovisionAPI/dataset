Who The Hell Is Edgar?

Oh my God, you're such a good writer
Oh, it's not me, it's Edgar
Who the hell is Edgar?

There's a ghost in my body and he is a lyricist
It is Edgar Allan Poe, and I think he can't resist
Yeah, his brain is in my hand, and it's moving really fast

Don't know how he possessed me, but I'm happy that he did
'Cause this song is feeling special, and is gonna make me rich
Yeah, the words are spilling out, what the heck is this about?

Oh, <span class="lyrics_mark" data-mark="q5b26a789k">mio padre</span>, there's a ghost in my body, oh oh ohh…

Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Edgar Allan, Edgar Allan
Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Edgar Allan Poe

Maybe I should call a doctor or an exorcist
Maybe someone out there knows where Shakespeare is so I can get a taste
What's your IPI? Where's the A&amp;R?
Girl, call Universal, you're about to be a star

Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Edgar Allan, Edgar Allan
Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe
Edgar Allan
Who the hell is Edgar?

Oh, mio padre
(Poe, Poe, Poe…)
There's a ghost in my body
(Poe, Poe, Poe…)
Oh, mio padre
(Poe, Poe, Poe…)
There's a ghost in my body

Zero dot zero zero three
Give me two years, and your dinner will be free
Gas station champagne is on me
Edgar cannot pay rent for me
Zero dot zero zero
Zero dot zero zero
Zero dot zero zero three
At least it pays to be funny
Ugh

Oh, mio padre
(Poe, Poe, Poe…)
There's a ghost in my body
(Poe, Poe, Poe…)
Oh, mio padre
(Poe, Poe, Poe…)
There's a ghost in my body
(Poe, Poe, Poe…)
Oh, mio padre
(Poe, Poe, Poe…)
There's a ghost in my body
(Poe, Poe, Poe…)
Oh, mio padre
(Poe, Poe, Poe…)
There's a ghost in my body

Oh, mio padre, there's a ghost in my body, oh oh ohh…
