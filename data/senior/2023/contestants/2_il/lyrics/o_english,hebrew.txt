Unicorn

Hey, you don't like the way I'm talking
Hey, so you stand there keep on call me names
No, I'm not your enemy so
If you're gonna do it, don't do it

Hey, do you wanna check my DNA?
Older stories, time to go away
And believe in fairytales oh
If you're gonna do it…

I'm gonna stand here like a unicorn
Out here on my own
I got the power of a unicorn
Don't you ever learn?
That I won't look back
I won't look down
I'm going up
You better turn around
The power of a unicorn
The power of a unicorn

History caught in a loop
Don't you wanna change it?
You know that we can, you and me
Can write a new book
Don't you wanna change it now?

It's gonna be
Phenomen-phenomen-phenomenal
Phenomen-phenomenal
Feminine-feminine-femininal

I'm gonna stand here like a unicorn
Out here on my own
I got the power of a unicorn
Don't you ever learn?
That I won't look back
I won't look down
I'm going up
You better turn around
The power of a unicorn
The power of a unicorn

It's gonna be
Phenomen-phenomen-phenomenal
Phenomen-phenomenal

Phenomen-phenomenal

You can call me queen

You wanna see me dance?
You wanna see me dance?
You wanna see me dance?
Watch me

It's gonna be
U-ni-corn
