We Are One

We take our first breath
And then we exhale
Then we give it all we got
Until we fail

We get back up again
We take a look around
Oh, life can be a long road
But at least we're not alone

We might be different, we might be unique
You might be a leader, I might be a freak
And we might be different
But under the falling sun

Tonight we are one
We are one
When we rise, we rise like the sun
When we go down, we go down, we go down, we go down

We take our first step
And then we fall
But still we keep on going
Climbing every wall

We keep on fighting
Turning every stone
And life can be a long road
At least we're not alone

We might be different, we might be unique
You might be a leader, I might be a freak
And we might be different
But under the falling sun

Tonight we are one
We are one
When we rise, we rise like the sun
When we go down, we go down, we go down

We are one
(We might be different, we might be unique)
We are one
(You might be a leader, I might be a freak)
When we rise, we rise like the sun
When we go down, we go down, we go down, we go down

We are one
(We might be different, we might be unique)
You might be a leader, I might be a freak
We might be different, but under the falling ѕun

Tonight we аre one
