Carpe Diem

We'll dance and play until the stars fade
Across the sky we're writing our names
Got no regrets, we want it all

Running out of words, silence hurts
Truth as thin as ice
Time to escape all the drama

They're looking for a fight, every night
Its written in their eyes
There's no escaping the karma

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
You wont catch me don't you know
Give me what belongs to me
No, because I'll take it all
A a a
We should be taking back control

We'll play our love against your hate
Don't you count on us to let you win today
Today

We'll dance and play until the stars fade
Across the sky we're writing our names
Got no regrets, we want it all
Won't count the hours till the sunrise
Lets leave a mark before our goodbyes
To fill our hearts and our souls

Waiting for the rain to wash away
Everything the shadow dancers say
Eyes will light up with the fall of dusk

We'll play our love against your hate
Don't you count on us to let you win today Let me hear you say

We'll dance and play until the stars fade
Across the sky we're writing our names
Got no regrets, we want it all
Won't count the hours till the sunrise
Lets leave a mark before our goodbyes
Because we're only fully alive
This moment in time
No mountain we can't climb

We danced and played until the sun came
Writing a story using our names
About a generation not afraid to ѕeize the dаy
