Heart of Steel

Sometimes gotta let it go
Sometimes gotta look away
Sometimes you just gotta know
When to stick your middle finger up in the air
I cannot explain
Tell you how I feel
Life is just a game
And I'm playing for the win

Don't be scared to say just what you think
'Cause no matter how bad, someone's listening

Don't care what you say
Don't care how you feel
Get out of my way
'Cause I got a heart of steel
Don't care what you say
Or how you feel
Oh, I got a heart of steel

You just like to act a fool
Tryna get in my head like
When I turn on my headlights
I can see right through you
Tryna get a reaction
I just hit the action move
Despite the pain
I continue my fight
The world is on fire
And you act

Don't be scared to say just what you think
'Cause no matter how bad, someone's listening

Don't care what you say
Don't care how you feel
Get out of my way
'Cause I got a heart of steel
Don't care what you say
Or how you feel
Oh, I got a heart of steel
Don't care what you say
Or how you feel
Oh, I got a heаrt of ѕteel
