Like An Animal

C'mon, baby, come and find me
I can smell you like an animal
Bring the party, Aphrodite, and I'll tease you on the dancefloor

You have, you have snake eyes
And I get, I get butterflies
You have, you have snake eyes
With your hips, with your sexy look, you paralyse
And I get, I get butterflies
In my ears, in my stomach all the time

Come on baby, come and find me
I can smell you like an animal
Bring the party, Aphrodite, and I'll chase you on the dance floor
Come on baby, come and find me
I can smell you like an animal
Bring the party, Aphrodite, and I'll chase you on the dance floor

You have, you have a biting tongue
And it gets, it gets me so unstrung
You have, you have a biting tongue
To tie me up and deviate my inner thoughts
And it gets highly dangerous
Like a drug in my veins, you are poison

Come on baby, come and find me
I can smell you like an animal
Bring the party, Aphrodite, and I'll chase you on the dance floor
Come on baby, come and find me
I can smell you like an animal
Bring the party, Aphrodite, and I'll chase you on the dance floor

Come on baby (I can smell you like an animal)
Come on baby (I can smell you like an animal)

The way, she knows the way
The way to turn me on
The way, she knowѕ the way
The wаy to turn me on
