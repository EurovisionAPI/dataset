Queen of Kings

<i style="color:#789">Combatteremo sempre bensì
Amore e fede la gente rapì
Il nostro motto sarà così:
Veni vidi vici</i>

She, queen of the kings
Running so fast
Beating the wind
Nothing in this world could stop the spread of her wings

She, queen of the kings
Broken her cage
Threw out the keys
She will be the warrior of north and southern seas

Got raven hair as dark as night
Icy eyes outta sight, outta sight
Her heart in spite, is warm and bright
Her smile awakes the northern light

Looking out she calls
Lai-laida-dai-daida
Who will conquer all?
All

Her name is She, queen of the kings
Running so fast
Beating the wind
Nothing in this world could stop the spread of her wings

She, queen of the kings
Broken her cage
Threw out the keys
She will be the warrior of north and southern seas

A firestone forged in flames
Wildest card run the game, run the game
Can't say the same in this world of change
Don't fear the pain just break the chain

Looking out she calls
Lai-laida-dai-daida
Who will conquer all?
All

Her name is She, queen of the kings
Running so fast
Beating the wind
Nothing in this world could stop the spread of her wings

She, queen of the kings
Broken her cage
Threw out the keys
She will be the warrior of north and southern seas

Her name is She, queen of the kings
Running so fast
Beating the wind
Nothing in this world could stop the spread of her wings

She, queen of the kings
Broken her cage
Threw out the keys
She will be the warrior of north and southern seаѕ
