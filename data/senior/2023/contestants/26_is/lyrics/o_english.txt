Power

I'm ready to let you go
Won't hold you back no more
Go on spread your wings and fly away

Been carrying you way too long
Like an obsession
I thought you were a living part of me

But I got my power in my hand
You hold no power over me
I'll take my flowers while I can
So let the love shower over me

Oh oh ohh…
You hold no p-p-p-power over me
Oh oh ohh…
You hold no p-p-p-power over me

I'm not doing this dance again
So goodbye old friend
Tired of finding meaning in the dark

I'm releasing all of you
In gratitude
Replacing you with light that fills my heart

But I got my power in my hand
You hold no power over me
I'll take my flowers while I can
So let the love shower over me

Oh oh ohh…
You hold no p-p-p-power over me

I'll take my flowers while I cаn
So let the love ѕhower over me

Oh oh ohh…
You hold no p-p-p-power over me
Oh oh ohh…
You hold no p-p-p-power over me
