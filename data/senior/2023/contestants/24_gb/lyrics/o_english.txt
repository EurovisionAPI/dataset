I Wrote A Song

When you said you were leavin'
To work on your mental health
You didn't mention the cheating
You kept that one to yourself

I got so mad was gonna

Cuss you out, outside your house
For everyone to see
Wanted to trash your Benz, tell all your friends
How cruel you were to me

Instead I wrote a song
'Bout how you did me wrong
I could have cried at home
And spent the night alone
Instead I wrote a song
I feel much better now
Me and my girls are out
And we all sing along

Instead I wrote a song
Da-da-da-da-da-dai…
Instead I wrote a song
Da-da-da-da-da-dai…
Instead I wrote a song

I kept my cool and composure
My mother would be so proud
I was ready for a sentence baby
Instead I wrote it all down

Oh I was gonna
Cuss you out, outside your house
For everyone to see
Wanted to trash your Benz, tell all your friends
How cruel you were to me

Instead I wrote a song
'Bout how you did me wrong
I could have cried at home
And spent the night alone
Instead I wrote a song
I feel much better now
Me and my girls are out
And we all sing along

Instead I wrote a song
Da-da-da-da-da-dai…
Instead I wrote a song
Da-da-da-da-da-dai…
Instead I wrote a song

Look into my eyes
She's feeling good, she feels alive
I choose how to live my life
I took the wrongs, I made it right
Don't let nobody make you forget who you should be
You're powerful, you're all you need
So work it baby, come with me

Let's celebrate
Dance it away
I thought my heart would break

Instead I wrote a song
'Bout how you did me wrong
I could have cried at home
And spent the night alone
Instead I wrote a song
I feel much better now
Me and my girls are out
And we all sing along
