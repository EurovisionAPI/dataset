Obviously

My heart, my hands, my eyes, my hips
Nothing's mine anymore
I kill myself to give them life
And act like it was nothing

In my hell garden
The plants are watered with the dreams and tears
Even at the top of the highest mountain
You still can't touch the sky

Obviously
All these promises I hear are passing
Like the wind
Obviously
It's always quiet before the storm
Don't you forget
It's always too good to be true
But never too ugly to be unreal
Obviously
This girl little that I was
Will never be the same

I trade my future, to get my past back
But time is treacherous
I look for love but never find it
Like a lost key

It's not clear in my head
I want the truth but I keep avoiding it
You might be on the top of the world
Still your finger won't touch the sky

Obviously
All these promises I hear are passing
Like the wind
Obviously
This girl little that I was
Will never be the same

Because I sing
My life and yours, a little romance
As I stand naked before you
Give me a chance
From you to me, from me to you
Didn't I succeed singing the Great France

It's always too good to be true
But never too ugly to be unreal
Obviously
This girl little that I was
Will never be the sаme
Obviouѕly
