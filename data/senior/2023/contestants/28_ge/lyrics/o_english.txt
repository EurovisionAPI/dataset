Echo

Days in a row
I'm thinking, I know
I've got a big faith
My love is my crown
Will be better way
Will be better day now
It is not a secret

Life is love
Thing is known
Like in dreams

Going through the life together
Going through the life together
Like in dreams

Days in a row
I'm thinking, I know
I've got a big faith
My love is my crown
Will be better way
Will be better day now
It is not a secret

Days in a row
I'm thinking, I know
I've got a big faith
My love is my crown
Will be better way
Will be better day now
It is not a secret

Going through the life together
Going through the life together

Days in a row
I'm thinking, I know
I've got a big faith
My love is my crown
Will be better way
Will be better day now
It is not a secret

Days in a row
I'm thinking, I know
My love is not a fake
This feeling is lord
Will be better way
Will be better day now
It is not a secret

My soul's like a fortress
I feel I'm progressed
Words getting worthless
Love is a wordless

Oh…
When life is loved
Loved…

Days in a row
I'm thinking, I know
I've got a big faith
My love is my crown
Will be better way
Will be better day now
It is not а ѕecret
