Watergun

When we were boys
We played pretend
Army tanks
And army men
Hide and seek
Grow to be the kings we dream

Where did we go?
We're standin' on the frontline
Where did we go?
We go?

I don't wanna be a soldier, soldier
I don't wanna have to play with real blood
We ain't playin' now
Can't turn and run
No water guns
No no

I don't wanna be a soldier, soldier
I don't wanna have to play with real blood
'Cause we ain't playin' now
Can't turn and run
No water guns
Just body bags that we've become

Adolescence, breaking rules
Nothin hurts when you're bulletproof
I remember, yes, I do, I do

Where did we go?
We're standin' on the frontline
Where did we go?
We go?

I don't wanna be a soldier, soldier
I don't wanna have to play with real blood
We ain't playin' now
Can't turn and run
No water guns
No no

I don't wanna be a soldier, soldier
I don't wanna have to play with real blood
'Cause we ain't playin' now
Can't turn and run
No water guns
Just body bags that we've become

What we've become
What we've become
What we've become

Playin' with water guns
Not playin' with wаter gunѕ
