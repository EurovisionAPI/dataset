Stay

Čiūto tūto</i>

I've carried sadness with me
I hid it well since sixteen
And all the crying, all the fighting
It kept putting out the fire
That burned so bright within me

As I look back to all these years
To broken dreams disguising fear
Being someone that I'm really not

Just stay with me
My heart is bleeding
I need your healing
Wait for me
Well, it ain't easy
To love someone like me

<i style="color:#789">Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto</i>
Finally my heart is beating

<i style="color:#789">Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto</i>
Finally my heart is beating

I took it all on myself
I asked for nobody's help
Had to taste it and embrace it
All the bitterness of failure
To find myself within me

Just stay with me
My heart is bleeding
I need your healing
Wait for me
Well, it ain't easy
To love someone like me

<i style="color:#789">Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto</i>
Finally my heart is beating

<i style="color:#789">Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto</i>
Finally my heart is beating

Just stay
Just ѕtаy

<i style="color:#789">Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto
Čiūto tūto</i>
