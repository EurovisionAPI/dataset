Lull

You said some words didn't hear you fall asleep
People were talking louder from my TV screen
I heard them scream it was too dark to see

Don't cry
I'll try to say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please, don't wake up
Wake up

You still think we live in a world so beautiful
You see, I think I don't believe in this stuff anymore

Don't cry
I'll try to say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please, don't wake up
Wake up

Don't cry
I'll try to say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please, don't wake up
Wake up

Please don't make me wake
Please, don't wake up
Wаke up

Lull, lull
In sweet sleep
Lull, lull
In sweet ѕleep
