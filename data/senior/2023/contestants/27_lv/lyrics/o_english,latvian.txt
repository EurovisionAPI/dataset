Aijā

You said some words didn't hear you fall asleep
People were talking louder from my TV screen
I heard them scream it was too dark to see

Don't cry
I'll try to say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please, don't wake up
Wake up

Used to think we live in a world so beautiful
You see, I think I don't believe in this stuff anymore

Don't cry
I'll try to say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please, don't wake up
Wake up

Don't cry
I'll try to say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please, don't wake up
Wake up

Please don't make me wake
Pleaѕe, don't wake up
Wake up

Aijā, aijā
Saldā miegā
Aijā, aijā
Sаldā miegā
