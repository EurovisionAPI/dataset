My Sister's Crown

My sister won't stand in the corner
Nor will she listen to you
My sister, wild at heart
Will never let you tie her down
My sister won't stand in the corner
Nor will she listen to you

My sister's crown
Don't take it down
Don't take it down

Nobody has right to do it
She's beautiful
And capable
She is her own queen
And she will prove it

You can take your hands back
No one wants more boys dead
We're not your dolls
We're not your dolls

Life's not a moneybag
Blood's on your God's head
You can't steal our souls
You can't steal our souls

My beautiful sister
You are so strong
Brave and the only one
The crown is yours

My beautiful sister
You are so strong
Brave and the only one
The crown is yours

My sister's crown
Don't take it down

Give me your hand, don't be afraid
Come swim with your sisters
There's no place for hate in our sea
God forbid
Don't be sad
Hop trop these girls ain't here for you nonstop
Remember we're sisters till the end

You can take your hands back
No one wants more boys dead
We're not your dolls
We're not your dolls

Life's not a moneybag
Blood's on your God's head
You can't steal our souls
You can't steal our souls

My beautiful sister
You are so strong
Brave and the only one
The crown is yours
My beautiful sister
You are so strong
Brave and the only one
The crown is yours

My sister's crown
Don't take it down
My sister's crown
Don't take it down

All the sisters of the world
Come together with a prayer
Choose love over power

My beautiful sister
You are so strong
Brave and the only one
The crown is yours
My beautiful sister
You are so strong
Brave and the only one
The crown is yours

My beautiful sister
You are so strong
Brave and the only one
The crown is yours
My beautiful sister
You are so strong
Brave and the only one
The crown is yours

My beautiful sister
You are so strong
Brave and the only one
The crown is yours
My beautiful sister
You are so strong
Brave and the only one
The crown is yours

In our hearts, we are with you
We ѕtаnd for you
