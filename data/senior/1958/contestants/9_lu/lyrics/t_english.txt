A great love

A great love, that begins
Without thinking about it most of the time
And we listen to a romance
Born from a stirring silence

Because you know when we love each other
Even words are too much
What's the use of dreaming of a poem?
The supreme moment is much nicer

Eyes which are turning away quickly
And then hesitate to come back
To the eyes that tempt
And invite them to smile

That is how love imposes itself
And suggests something crazy to you
We don't live love in prose
We transpose it in poetry

A great love, alas, is ending
Like a nice dream in a sigh
Again worries trouble you
The sweet rest comes to an end

What does it matter that life is short
And that its vigour runs out one day
If friendship takes over
When a great love ends

If friendship takes over
When a greаt love endѕ
