My little kitty

It was a melancholy day
It might happen to you tomorrow
I was walking around in the streets
Aimlessly and thinking about nothing

When I perceived her, she came to me
It's unbelievable, but it's true

She had all the trump cards in her game
And the skills up to her fingertips
Arguments, as much as you want
Put me up to anything

She had this funny little look
As if she wasn't really one
She smiled at me, being sure of its effect

I didn't believe there could be
Toys like that on earth
It was a dream to see that little kitty there
Not much higher than that

With crupled eyes
As they say it in songs
And all you need to do to please boys

And it was a love story
A story with a happy ending
And as this always happens
I married her one beautiful morning

And the evening came, I didn't dare to think about it
It's unbelievable, but know

She had all the trump cards in her game
And the skills up to her fingertips
It doesn't take a long time to say it
She put me up to anything

She had this funny little look
As if she wasn't really one
She smiled at me, being sure of its effect

I didn't believe there could be
Toys like that on earth
It was a dream to see that little kitty there
Curled up in my arms

With crupled eyes
As they say it in songs
And all you need to do to please boys
And all that can make you go mad
And all you can't sаy in songѕ
