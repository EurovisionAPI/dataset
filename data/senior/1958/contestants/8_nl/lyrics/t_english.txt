The whole world

I must tell my secret to the whole world
Because I'm happy
The whole world is now twice as important to me
Because now I know what happiness is

But isn't this world too busy?
Who still has time for happiness?
Yet I want to cheer because
I must tell my secret to the whole world
Because I'm happy

Shall I write cards to let everyone know?
Shall I advertise in the paper?
It doesn't matter for me how I tell it
But it must be known throughout the country

But isn't this world too busy?
Who still has time for happiness?
Yet I want to cheer because
I must tell my secret to the whole world
Becauѕe I'm hаppy
