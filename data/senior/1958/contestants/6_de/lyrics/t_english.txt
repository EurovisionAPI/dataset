Music for two pence

They chose Miss Germany, Miss France and Miss Italy
There are also Miss Fashion and Miss Leg
But since everybody likes music
And there is no Miss Jukebox yet
I just want to be Miss Jukebox for once

Music for two pence, music for two pence
And everyday life fades away when happy music is played
Music for two pence, music for two pence
And for this little money, a world belongs to you

Do you want quiet music?
Do you want hot music?
Or do you find a minor key just wonderful?
Music for two pence, music for two pence
And for this little money, a world belongs to you

May it be music of Dixieland
Or songs from the Rhine?
Or do you prefer Verdi's operas?
Music for two pence, music for two pence
And for this little money, a world belongs to you

Music for two pence, music for two pence
Music for two pence, music for two pence

Here's the man at the piano
Here's the march, so are we
Here's the woodsman who sings when the home bells ring
Music for two pence, music for two pence
And for this little money, а world belongѕ to you
