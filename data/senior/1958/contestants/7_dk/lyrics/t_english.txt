I tore a page out of my diary

When you left in anger, I regretted
The fault was mine - the reason, well… it tricked me
What we had together, was beautiful and great
Do you know what I've done today?

I tore a page out of my diary
Every little word I regret, my dear
What's the use, that I'm wise afterwards
If you think, everything must come to an end?

Try to forgive me, even if it is hard
Then I'll promise you, that it will never happen again

I tore a page out of my diary
You do the same, my friend

If you hate me, really, you have a reason
My jealousy, I was more than mean
Do try to forgive, that I was bad
And if you're great enough, well then forget

I tore a page out of my diary
Every little word I regret, my dear
What's the use, that I'm wise afterwards
If you think, everything must come to an end?

Try to forgive me, even if it is hard
Then I'll promise you, that it will never happen again

I tore a page out of my diary
You do the same, my friend
You do the ѕаme, my friend
