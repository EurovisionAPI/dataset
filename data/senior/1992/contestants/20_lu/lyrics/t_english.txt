As free

Like a kite in the wind
A paper boat in the sky
A coloured whirligig
On big blue trampoline
Like a kite in the wind
Flying over all frontiers

I want to be as free
I want to be as free
I want to be as free
As thoughts can be

See that child on his way
Playing his life so easily
When his laughter bubbles out
The dark turns to light
See that child on his way
Building his home on dreams

I want to be as free
I want to be as free
I want to be as free
As thoughts can be

Fly with me to the sun
And reach out for the stars
There is another world
Where all is understood
Fly with me to the sun
Beyond ourselves

I want to be as free
I want to be as free
I want to be as free
As thoughts can be

(I want to be as free)
As free
As free
(I want to be as free)
As thoughtѕ cаn be
