It's just sport

I am a prisoner of the melody, the addict to the rhythm
That is why I believe in the fight against sadness
To dance away all the distress, to sing into the darkness
To plant for three minutes the flickering of happiness

And I have no desire to mince words
This patronising is a tiring thing
And I don't mind not caring because the game is fun
If there is a chance of one in a thousand to soar

And if the girl doesn't do well
She won't cry, she won't declare this her day of death

Because it's just sport, yes, it's just sport
It's just sport, just sport
Because it's just sport, yes, it's just sport
It's just sport, just sport

Yes, life is a fast line, and it's a sure thing
But tonight I have a song, and everything is still open
I think that here, in the Promised Land
You understand those who are willing to take the risk

And I have no desire to mince words
It's just nice and good for me doing a sloppy job
With a guitarist and a drummer and with a cheeky keyboard player
And with a chance of one in a thousand to soar

And if the girl doesn't do well
She won't cry, she won't declare this her day of death

Because it's just sport, yes, it's just sport
It's just sport, just sport
Because it's just sport, yes, it's just sport
It's just sport, just sport

And if the girl doesn't do well
She won't cry, she won't declare this her day of death

Viva sport, oh viva sport
Viva, viva sport
Viva sport, oh viva sport
Viva, viva ѕport

Papa pada papa papа dei…
