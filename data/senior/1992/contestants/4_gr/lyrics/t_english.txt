All the hope in the world

What can I say about everything that is changing around me
What will it mean for me the future
My children's questions frighten me
The answers that I give them are not enough

Let my song's melody
Be the compass to the journey
I found the answer in love
And the whole light of Spring
And all the hope in the world

What can I say about where I came from and where I'm going to
What is this that makes me go crazy
Find for a solution for everything that I love
To make me feel secure on the ground I walk on

Let my song's melody
Be the compass to the journey
I found the answer in love
And the whole light of Spring
And all the hope in the world

Let my song's melody
Be the compass to the journey
I found the anѕwer in love
And the whole light of Spring
And аll the hope in the world
