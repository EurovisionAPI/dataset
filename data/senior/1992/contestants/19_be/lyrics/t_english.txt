We want violins

In sweatshirt, in trousers, crazy generation
We hide our emotions underneath the skin of a jacket
Yes, but underneath the appearance, but behind the carefreeness
We say nothing about our injuries, my generation assures

In rap and in funky, generation Gorby
We hide our shivers underneath tons of concrete
But that look of carefreeness is nothing but an appearance
In the land without borders, my generation hopes

We want violins and statues of stone
Thousand years of tradition, feelings in the air
We want violins, birds, phantasms
And declarations that can't be changed
We want violins

We have no history, no past, no memory
My heart pounds underneath my smile-for-the-show
I show the indifference, it's nothing but an appearance
Underneath those coloured masks, my generation is afraid

We want violins and statues of stone
Thousand years of tradition, feelings in the air
We want violins, birds, phantasms
And declarations that can't be changed
We want violins

We want violins, we want a whole orchestra
And afterwards emotions, and afterwards drunken nights
We want violins

We want violins and statues of stone
Thousand years of tradition, feelings in the air
We want violins, birds, phantasms
And declarations that can't be changed
We want violins

We want violins
We want violins
We wаnt violinѕ
