Fresh water love

When I saw your plum eyes
And your black berry mouth
So much honey, so much sun
In your juicy and wild lock of hair

I was sure it was you
My grape candy
And nut on the table
Strawberry and cashew love

I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket
You laughed and made my head spin
Come here, I'm thirsty
I want your fresh water love

I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket
You laughed and made my head spin
Come here, I'm thirsty
I want your fresh water love, oh…

You have an orange tang in your skin
And three segments of laughter in your kiss
So much honey, so much sun, fruit, juice, fresh water
I tasted them and I went crazy

It was in the morning that was alight in you
Avocado, wild plum
And French pear, pomegranate
Raspberry, kiwi

I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket
You laughed and made my head spin
Come here, I'm thirsty
I want your fresh water love

I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket
You laughed and made my head spin
Come, come, come here, I'm thirsty
I want your fresh water love

Ah… it was in the morning that was alight in you
Avocado, wild plum
And French pear, pomegranate
Raspberry, kiwi

I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket
You laughed and made my head spin
Come, come, come here, I'm thirsty
I want your fresh water love

I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket
You laughed and made my head spin
Come, come, come here, I'm thirsty
I want your fresh water love

I picked you, bit into you and put you in the bаѕket
