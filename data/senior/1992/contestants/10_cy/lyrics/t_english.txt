We're alike

I give you my lips, and into my existence
With every cell of mine I wrap you
You get lost in me, you play and get stuck
And I hide you under my skin

We're alike, you want what I want
A night with no tomorrow
We look alike, like two pieces of sky
Which mix to become water
And vanish
We're alike, we're alike

Scattered signs, bodies surrendering
And me begging for your touch
In a complete picture, a mad minefield
I become an explosion in front of you

We're alike, you want what I want
A night with no tomorrow
We look alike, like two pieces of sky
Which mix to become water
And vanish
We're alike, we're alike

We're alike, you want what I want
A night with no tomorrow
We look alike, like two pieces of sky
Which mix to become water
And vaniѕh
We're alike, we're аlike
