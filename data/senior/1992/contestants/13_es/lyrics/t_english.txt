All this is music

Just once before going
Far away to another place
We have to talk once again
And see if we can go on

You're my obsession, and only I beg God
That tomorrow you will remember me
Only a song can speak of love
And tell all the sorrows that I have in my heart

All this is music, which surrounds your body
Only this moment fills me with happiness
All this is music, which I have so inside of me
My memory, to be sincere, is for you

I think it was my fault
But you left without saying goodbye
Only between us, hate and love
Are in our hearts

All this is music, which surrounds your body
Only this moment fills me with happiness
All this is music, which I have so inside of me
My memory, to be sincere (is for you)

Everything good and bad in life
Makes sense with music
Music is happiness, and also sadness
Peace, harmony and dreams
And the taste of your kisses

All this is music, which surrounds your body
Only this moment fills me with happiness
All this is music, which I hаve so inside of me
My memory, to be sincere, is for you, iѕ for you
