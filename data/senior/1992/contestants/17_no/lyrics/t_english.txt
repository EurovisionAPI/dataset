Visions

Visions from a dream provides reflection and a prayer
Let the future belong to us
We only reap what we sow
What have we understood then, of the time that has passed?
Can the past carry the children of the future?

A century is ebbing out, a new era is knocking on our door
Has progress led us astray?
The fire of the past contains hot embers
Nature is wounded, values are at stake
Now we see all of yesterday's mistakes

But the hope has been lit, it can never be too late
For knowledge to put down roots
Which provide us with courage and a will to create
Culture is a heritage for the people of our country
A mirror of times passed by

Give us a dawn with children's laughter and song
We love our father and mother
We have love to give to our sister and brother
Give us a sunrise and let our dream be true
Together on the path of hope we walk hand in hand

We only have this earth, let tomorrow become a friend
Show love to your fellow man
And you will have honesty in return
Let big and small share the same table
In a friendship which is alive and growing

Give us a dawn with children's laughter and song
We love our father and mother
We have love to give to our sister and brother
Give us a sunrise and let our dream be true
Together on the path of hope we walk hand in hand

(Give us a dawn with children's laughter and song)
(We love our father and mother)
(We have love to give to our sister and brother)
Give us a sunriѕe and let our dream be true
Together on the path of hope we walk hand in hаnd
