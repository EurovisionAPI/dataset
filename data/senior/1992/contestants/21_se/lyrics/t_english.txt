Tomorrow is another day

There is a girl, that I go to see sometimes
She likes me, because I'll always do my best
She has a silence and there's so much I want to know
So I'll stay the whole night, even though we're like water and fire

(Come) as long as the heart is beating
(Come) as long as there is excitement
Tomorrow is another day
(Come) as long as the sun shines
(Come) as long as lust is giving and taking
And when everything is gone, tomorrow is another day

She paints pictures, that I've never seen
She sings her songs, when nobody is sitting next to her
In her eyes there is a longing for more
So I'll stay the whole night, even though we're like water and fire

(Come) as long as the heart is beating
(Come) as long as there is excitement
Tomorrow is another day
(Come) as long as the sun shines
(Come) as long as lust is giving and taking
And when everything is gone, tomorrow is another day

Time is like a hourglass in your hand
Where seconds and minutes turn into years
I want everything I get

(Come) as long as the heart is beating
(Come) as long as there is excitement
Tomorrow is another day
(Come) as long as the sun shines
(Come) as long as lust is giving and taking
And when everything is gone, tomorrow is another day

Tomorrow iѕ another dаy
