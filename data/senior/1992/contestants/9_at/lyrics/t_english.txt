We were a real conspired team
We were always hardened against the wind
I thought we'd never get off the way
What we had, was like an Odyssey
With you again, I'll be glad to...

I'm frightened to be out there, now, to be totally without you

Go together to the horizon?
Together with you, together strong
Go together, so far with you

Go together, so far with you
For two people who love each other so much, waiting is still too much

Go together to the horizon
Together with you, together strong
Go together, so far with you
For two people who love each other so much, wаiting is ѕtill too much

Go together
