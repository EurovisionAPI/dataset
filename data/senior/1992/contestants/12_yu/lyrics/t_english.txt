I'm kissing you with songs

I prayed to God
To give me strength
To forgive you everything
To forget as soon as possible
Those long prayers

You're still on my lips
I'm kissing you with songs
Dreaded dreams were waiting for us
But we never went to sleep

The dawn broke two glasses
It got drunk of love
It sang better than gypsies
Oh, God, did I dream it all

You're still on my lips
I'm kissing you with songs
Dreaded dreams were waiting for us
But we never went to sleep

The dawn broke two glasses
It got drunk of love
It sang better than gypsies
Oh, God, did I dream it all

The dawn broke two glasses
It got drunk of love
It sang better than gypsieѕ
Oh, God, did I dream it аll
