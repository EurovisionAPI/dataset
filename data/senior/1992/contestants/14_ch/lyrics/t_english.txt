Mister Music Man

I dreamt for so long that I could hold him in my arms
I asked the conductor very silently:

Mister Music Man, do you want to play a sweet tune?
Do you have a slow, just for the two of us?
I dream so much that I could take him in my arms

Mister Music Man, do you have a song from the old days
That will make him dance with me?
Mister, be very kind, come to my aid

It's incredible, I really did not expect it
Unthinkable, when I came all alone tonight

Mister Music Man, do you want to play a sweet tune?
Put the lights down around us
And let us dance with tenderness
And then I beg you
Mister, if you agree
Play it again and again

It's incredible, I had lost all hope
Unthinkable, when I came all alone tonight

Mister Music Man, do you want to play a sweet tune?
Put the lights down around us
And let us dance with tenderness
And then I beg you
Miѕter, if you agree
Play it again and agаin
