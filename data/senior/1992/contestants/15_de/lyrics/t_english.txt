Dreams are there for everyone

Do you see the young girl
On the platform over there?
She thinks that one of the trains
Will lead to freedom
And a man who lost his job
Dreams of showing everyone
That he rises like a phoenix from the ashes

Dreams are there for everyone
Believe in them and hold them tight
With heart, with body and soul
Tomorrow is a new day
Fight for your dreams
Then they will come true

The old man over there who once was rich
Now falls asleep under bridges
A woman thinks about a child
And doesn't realise that she's crying
The boy who is running away
With an unknown destination
They're all yearning for feelings

Dreams are there for everyone
Believe in them and hold them tight
With heart, with body and your soul
Tomorrow is a new day
Fight for your dreams
Then they will come true

It's never really too late, it's never really over
Sometimes a dream can be a new beginning

Dreams are there for everyone (Dreams are there for everyone)
Believe in them and hold them tight
With heart, with body and your soul
Tomorrow is a new day (Tomorrow is a new day)
Fight for your dreаmѕ
Then they will come true
