Go up the river

Go up the river, wo, whoa…
Among the rocks and the roots
One day you'll see the source of the river
Go up the river, oh…
Open up your ears
Listen carefully to the sound of water
It will always show you the way
The way, yes, pe pe ba…
You'll never be thirsty
As you go up, the water will be fresher
You'll want to drink more and then you'll go up

Go up the river, wo
Among the rocks and the roots
One day you'll see the source of the river
Go up the river, wo
Open up your big eyes
Look carefully to the colour of the water
As you go up, it will be clearer
Clearer, yes, pe pe ba…
You can't get lost
It's so clear, it's shining
Like a light that shows you the way up

The river of love, the river of life, yes
Go up the river
Weah, weah, weah… the river of life, doodoo…

Go up the river, wo
By crossing stones we arrive
At the time you should already go out
Go up the river, wo
By crossing stones we arrive
At the time you should already go out

Go up the river, wo
Among the rocks and the roots
One day you'll see the source of the river
By crossing stones we arrive
At the time you should already go out
Among the rocks and the roots
One dаy you'll see the ѕource of the river
Go up the river, wo
