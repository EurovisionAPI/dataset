All the things that nobody sees

My friend got angry, he's gone home
So just like me you're alone at the party?
I know him, there's no chance left
Then you're free tonight, I take it
Now tell me, do you think I'm a girl, who'd fall for anybody?
I knew you'd say that, so why do we stay here?

When all the things that nobody sees
Nobody minds that, no thanks, I'll stay here
All the things that nobody knows
That can't be any of their business, you see?
Yes, all the things that nobody sees
Nobody minds that, a break is OK
If it's for love and if we're the only ones who know

What do you say, do you just think we should leave?
Give me a reason why we shouldn't do it
Just a moment, while I put on my coat
It's all about daring, while you dare it
We'll take a taxi, while we can get one without sensing time and place
Is it illegal to aim at an hour for love?

When all the things that nobody sees
Nobody minds that, like this affair
All the things that nobody knows
That can't be any of their business

What do we do, if someone sees us leave the party?
Yes, by the way
I know a trick that won't disgrace us:
We've left, because you've had
A drop more than you should have
Don't give me that
Now I'll find a door to use, so nobody will see that we're on our way

For, all the things that nobody sees
Nobody minds that, like this affair
All the things that nobody knows
That can't be any of their business
You know that, all the things that nobody sees
Nobody minds that, a break is OK
Lightning can easily strike, we're only a ѕecond awаy from love
