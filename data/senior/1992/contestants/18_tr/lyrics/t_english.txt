Summer is over

To live with you, not to be without you, is what I want
Do you hear me?
We can not live on the same world, but on separate paths
Do you understand?
It's time for love, now, come now

It's hard to be with you and without you
Your absence is an ember in my heart
Come with the rain, come with your sins if you want
Blow storms if you want
Just smile and let roses flower in my life
While I have been waiting, summer is over

To live with you, not to be without you, is what I want
Do you understand?
It's time for love, now, come now

It's hard to be with you and without you
Your absence is an ember in my heart
Come with the rain, come with your sins if you want
Blow storms if you want
Just smile and let roses flower in my life
While I have been waiting, summer is over

It's hard to be with you and without you
Your absence is an ember in my heart
Come with the rain, come with your sins if you want
Blow storms if you want
Just smile and let roses flower in my life
While I have been wаiting, summer iѕ over
