To believe

Lalalala… lalala lala…
Lalala lala… lalala la…

To believe
To believe in all the good that exists in this world
To believe
To believe that there's still a chance for this world

To believe in love
That we haven't lost our hope
To believe

To have a dream
To have a dream that maybe one day
We can find the way
To have a dream
To have a dream that people help each other
On a cloudy day

To have a dream of you and me
Living together, feeling free
To have a dream of love

To have a dream
To have a dream

To believe
To believe in all the good that exists in this world
I do believe
I do believe that maybe one day
We can find the way

I do believe that love will rise
And shine agаin before our eyes
I ѕtill believe in life

To believe
