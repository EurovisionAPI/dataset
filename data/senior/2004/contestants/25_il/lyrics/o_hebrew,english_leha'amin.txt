Leha'amin

To have a dream
To have a dream that maybe one day
We can find the way
To have a dream
To have a dream that people help each other
On a cloudy day

To have a dream of you and me
Living together, feeling free
To have a dream of love

To have a dream
To have a dream

Leha'amin
Leha'amin bechol hatov sheba'olam haze
I do believe
I do believe that maybe one day
We can find the way

I do believe that love will rise
And shine again before our eyes
I ѕtill believe in life
