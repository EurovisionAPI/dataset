It was magic

I don't know what it was
I don't know what got into me
But suddenly, there I was
It was magic, it was magic

And there you were
Smiling at me
I've never seen anything like this
It was magic, it was magic

It was magic
When I touched you, and the kiss that I gave you
(It was magic) on, on, on that day
(It was magic) on, on, on that day

It was magic
When I touched you, and I gave you a kiss
(It was magic) on, on, on that day
(It was magic) on that day

Ha...

I don't know what got into me
But the things that happened
Were quite divine
It was magic, it was magic

I don't know what it was
That made me act like that
I never did anything like that before
It was magic, it was magic

It was magic
When I touched you, and the kiss that I gave you
(It was magic) on, on, on that day
(It was magic) on that day

It was magic
When I touched you, and the kiss that I gave you
On that day
(It was magic) on, on, on that day
(It was magic) on, on, on that day

It was magic
When I touched you, and the kiss that I gave you
(It was magic) on, on, on that day
(It was magic) on, on, on that day

It was magic
When I touched you, and the kiss that I gave you
On that day
(It was magic) on, on, on that day
(It was magic) It was magic
(It waѕ mаgic)
