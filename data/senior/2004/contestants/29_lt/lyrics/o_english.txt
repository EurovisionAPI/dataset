What's Happened To Your Love

What's happened to your love?
What's happened to my love?
We've been together for so long
But now the feeling's gone

What's happened to your love?
What's happened to my love?
We've been together for so long
But now the feeling's gone
But now the feeling's gone

Could you give me one more try?
I will never make you cry
Yes, I've made mistakes before
Give your hand, let's go for more

Oh baby, you came back again
Your eyes are shining like a flame
I thought that I forgot your touch
But now I love you so much

What's happened to your love?
What's happened to my love?
We've been together for so long
But now the feeling's gone

What's happened to your love?
What's happened to my love?
We've been together for so long
But now the feeling's gone
But now the feeling's gone

I do remember your first words
Silence breaking down my heart
I wanna dream about sky blue
If I can, darling, stay with you

Let's walk, we did it for the first time
Along the wavy sea shoreline
Please smile, you always did to me, and just to me
Oh baby, tell, what do you feel?

What's happened to your love?
What's happened to my love?
We've been together for so long
But now the feeling's gone

What's happened to your love?
What's hаppened to my love?
We've been together for so long
But now the feeling's gone
But now the feeling'ѕ gone
