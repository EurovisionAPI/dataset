Stay Forever

Ooh… hey yeah yeah

Come on, let's fly away, girl
Up on cloud number nine I'd wish to flow
You're my most precious pearl
Hmm… waiting for you, that's all I need to know

Wait and see how it's gonna be
Hold my hand, just don't let go
Birds of a feather flock together
But time will tell, people say, so

Stay forever and ever
You will always be my baby
Stay forever, I'll never hurt you
I won't make you cry, no, no, no

Stay forever, no matter what may happen
Don't give up on me
Do whatever, I'll never let go
I will catch your fall

Through our sunny and dark sides of life
Feelings like this are made to survive
What the rest of the world thinks doesn't matter
Because we know it better

Stay forever and ever
You will always be my baby
Stay forever, I'll never hurt you
I won't make you cry, no, no, no

Stay forever, no matter what may happen
Don't give up on me
Do whatever, I'll never let go
I will catch your fall

Stay forever and ever
You will alwayѕ be my baby, baby
Stay forever, I'll never hurt you
I won't mаke you cry
