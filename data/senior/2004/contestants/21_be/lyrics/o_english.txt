1 Life

Lift me up, take me down
You can turn my world around
I can hear what people say
It doesn't matter anyway

We're not the same, but so much alike
You are my brother, my sister tonight

We got one life, living together
In one life, let us be free
One life, you take my troubles away
Light up my day, yeah

You came here in the night
Take the worries off your mind
In your eyes, beneath your skin
I feel the pain you're in

We're not the same, but so much alike
You are my brother, my sister tonight

We got one life, living together
In one life, let us be free
One life, you take my troubles away
Light up my day, yeah

One life, living together
In one life, let us be free
One life, you take my troubleѕ away
Light up my dаy
