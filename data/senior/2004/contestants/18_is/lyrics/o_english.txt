Heaven

I still miss you and it makes me feel blue
And I'm lost without those colours of you
I can't think straight, I just wanna be
Wherever you are when you're not here with me

Blend with my blue, those colours of you
Please help me see it through, oh...
This journey I must take alone
So just blend your colours with my blue

I lay down and cry, and the rivers are dry
Oh... to unveil my heart when you kiss me goodbye
And when you set sail, fair winds all the way
So farewell, that's all I can say

Mmm... blend with my blue, the colours of you
Oh... please help me see it through, oh...
This journey I must take alone
Oh... so just blend your colours with my blue

And I know I'll find my love tonight
I can feel you reachin' out
I got this feeling deep inside
It's in my head, it's in my heаrt

I know your love tonight
And I know you'll be by my side
I know you'll help me to see it through
Oh... blend your colourѕ with my blue
