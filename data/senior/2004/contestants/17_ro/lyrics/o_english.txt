I Admit

As in a dream, love appeared
Swept me away and made me lose control like never before
As in a dream, love touched me
I felt how it touched the bottom of my very soul

Now I know I find the key to my heart
I just hope this ain't a dream and that you are reality

I admit I fell for you so badly
And I admit you make my senses wild
I know sometimes I am looking foolish, I admit, I admit
I'll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine

It's good to be in love
It makes you touch the sky a thousand times or more
It's good to admit
That my heart starts to race when you walk through that door

Now I know you are the key to my heart
Just hope you're not a dream and that you'll be my everything

I admit I fell for you so badly
And I admit you make my senses wild
I know sometimes I am looking foolish, I admit, I admit
I'll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine

I admit I fell for you so badly, and I feel so good
And I admit you make my senses wild
I know sometimes I might act and look foolish, I admit, I admit
I'll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine

Just mine
You make me shine
You are the light in my life

I admit I fell for you so badly, and I feel so good
And I admit you make my senses wild
I know sometimes I am looking foolish, I admit, I admit
I'll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine

I admit I fell for you so badly, and I feel so good
And I admit you make my senses wild, oh yeah
I know sometimes I might act and look foolish, I admit, I admit
I'll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine, аll right
Mine, yes mine, just mine
Juѕt mine
