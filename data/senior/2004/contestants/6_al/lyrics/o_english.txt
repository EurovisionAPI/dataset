The Image Of You

How strange the feeling in your soul
When love invades your very being
Another me or so I'm told
And life takes on another meaning

Day after day, I go through the motions
Stumbling my way, life is a blur
Slave of my love, of my emotions
You're in my eyes, you're in my heart

One kiss, one heart in time
A kiss, the moment is mine
I close my eyes, I breathe
I'm queen of the world of make-believe

You make me feel a little crazy
You make me see your tears are true
You make my days and nights so hazy
You make me feel the image of you

You make me feel a little crazy
You make me see your tears are true
You make my days and nights so hazy
You make me feel the image of you

(You make me feel a little crazy)
(You make me see…)

One kiss, one heart in time
A kiss, the moment is mine
I close my eyes, I breathe
I'm queen of the world of make-believe

You make me feel a little crazy
You make me see your tears are true
You make my days and nights so hazy
You make me feel the image of you

You make me feel a little crazy
You make me see your tears are true
You make my days and nights so hazy
You make me feel the image of you

(You make me feel) a little crazy
(You make me see) your tears are true
(You make me feel) image of you

I know it's just a dream
I feel I love this life
I know it's just a dreаm
I feel I love thiѕ life
