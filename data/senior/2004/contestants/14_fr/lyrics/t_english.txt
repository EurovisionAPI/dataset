With every step

There are wounds that we'll have to forget
So many deletions that we'll have to wipe out
Blowing very hard so that the rancour flies away from our hearts
And then let the barriers fall one by one

With every step that we'll take
With every gesture that we'll offer
It will be the beginning of another tomorrow
In every word that we'll say
In this future that we'll build
Our hands will draw love

There are insults that we'll have to forgive
Cries against walls that will make them fall
Let's lay down the arms at our feet, let's abandon our armours
So that our conflicts will only be a whisper, yeah

With every step that we'll take
With every gesture that we'll offer
It will be the beginning of another tomorrow
In every word that we'll say
In this future that we'll build
Our hands will draw love

The battle will be long
But you know, it's worthwhile
The child in us will find the way

Oh... there are cracks that will remain broken
Slightly hard punches marked for eternity

With every step that we'll take
With every gesture that we'll offer
I know you'll find in the end
Peace and happiness
Along your path you'll find
Everything you'd like to reach

It's love that our handѕ will drаw
