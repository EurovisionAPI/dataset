Wild Dances

Just maybe I'm crazy 
The world spins round and round and round 
Shee ree kee dai, shee ree kee dam dei 
Shee ree kee dai, shee kee ree a dam da 

I want you to want me 
As I dance round and round and round 
Shee ree kee dai, shee ree kee dam dei 
Shee ree kee dai, shee kee ree a dam da 

Forever and ever 
Go, go, go, wild dancers 

Dai na, dai na, wanna be loved 
Dai na, gonna take my wild chances 
Dai na, dai na, freedom above 
Dai na, dai na dei, I'm wild dancin' 

Hey 

Probably, in vain
I was too obedient
Hey, shee kee dai, shee ree kee dam dei 
Shee ree kee dai, shee kee ree a dam da 

For you and for myself
I'll spread out the whole sky
Hey… dam dei 
Shee ree kee dai, shee kee ree a dam da 

I will set the fire without any sorrow
Go, go, go, wild dancers 

Dai na, dai na, wanna be loved 
Dai na, gonna take my wild chances 
Dai na, dai na, freedom above 
Dai na, dai na dei, I'm wild dancin' 

Hey… ho… 

Dance forever, come and be mine 
Dance together, till the end of time 
Dance together 
Go, go, go, wild dancers 

Dai na, dai na, wanna be loved 
Dai na, gonna take my wild chanceѕ 
Dai na, dai na, freedom above 
Dai na, dai na dei, I'm wild dаncin' 

Hey, hey
