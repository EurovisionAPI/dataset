You Are The Only One

Once again just hold me, let me feel you breathe
Softly kiss me on my face, love is all I need
Lonely moments, years, nothing before you
Finally you're here, our love is true

Hold me once again, my dear, let your passion take me
In my heart there's harmony when you're close to me
Even in my dreams, I really need to feel you
Forever we'll be one, our love is true

You are the only one, our love is timeless
When you are by my side, I'm truly blessed with…
With only happiness
I have got someone, someone of my own
A part of me who lives for me
Who would die for me

Hold me once again, my dear, let your passion take me
In my heart there's harmony when you're close to me
Even in my dreams, I really need to feel you
Forever we'll be one, our love is true

You are the only one, our love is timeless
When you are by my side, I'm truly blessed with…
With only happiness
I have got someone, someone of my own
A part of me who lives for me
Who would die for me

You are the only one (Our love is timeless)
(When you are) by my side, I'm truly blessed with…
With only happiness
I have got someone of my own
A part of me who lives for me
Who would die for me

A pаrt of me who liveѕ for me
Who would die for me
