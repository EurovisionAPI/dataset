On again... off again

Look at me, I need some attention
I'm a girl of serious intention
Just like a butterfly
My wings can take me high
To touch your piece of sky

Though I can fly away
Play cool, or run away
I choose to hold your love
More than one night

You're everything and nothing in one
(What do you mean?)
Our love goes from the north to the south
(I disagree)
I just can't understand anymore
What we have in common

On again, off again
Like the rhythm of rain
We need to decide
Find an end to this game
Such wonderful times
Many natural highs
Love is a flame that we can never tame
On again, off again

Why, oh why can't I live without you?
How, oh how do I reach inside you?
My love is justified
I simply had enough
I want you by my side

Am I your fantasy?
Mystery? Or destiny?
Do you take me for a ride?
Please, tell me now

You're the air, you're the love that I breathe
(That sounds so good)
You're the magic that flows from within
(I feel that too)
We come close, then we move far away
Can't we stay together?

On again, off again
Like the rhythm of rain
We need to decide
Find an end to this game
Such wonderful times
Many natural highs
Love is a flame that we can never tame
On again, off again

There's a river between us
And I need you to come across
Reach out for my heart
Keep this feeling so alive
Love grows, we survive

On again, off again
Like the rhythm of rain
We need to decide
Find an end to this game
Such wonderful times
Many natural highs
Love is a flame that we can never tame
On again, off again

Off again, on again
Like a flickering flame
That dies in the wind
And lights up again
Such wonderful times
Many natural highs
Love iѕ a flame we can never tame
On again, off again

On again, off agаin
