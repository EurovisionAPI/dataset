In The Disco

(In the disco)
Disco

I'm lying, I'm late, I'm losing my weight
Because I want to dance all night
Because I want to stay all night
In the disco, in the disco

You call me, you wait, take your shoes and go straight
Because you want to dance with me
Because you want to stay with me
In the disco, yeah, in the disco

Music is what I want, music is what I need
Kiss me and turn me slow, up and down, here we go
Music is what I want, music is what I need
Kiss me and turn me slow, up and down, here we go
(Go)

I'm lying, I'm late, I'm losing my weight
Because I want to dance all night
Because I want to stay all night
In the disco, yeah, in the disco

Music is what I want, music is what I need
Kiss me and turn me slow, up and down, here we go
Music is what I want, music is what I need
Kiss me and turn me slow, up and down, here we go
Music

(Yeah, yeah) Oh…
(In the disco)
Oh music, oh music
Oh music, oh music
(Go)

Music is what I want, music is what I need
Kiss me and turn me slow, up and down, here we go
Music is what I want, music is what I need
Kiss me and turn me slow, up аnd down, here we go
