Hold On To Our Love

Maybe I've been foolish letting you down
I've been a little selfish not being around
But if I lost you, I'd be helpless inside
Gotta hold on to our love tonight

'Cause now that I've found that someone I believe in
And I feel so complete by your side
It's the only time I've ever loved somebody, baby, in my life
We gotta hold on to our love tonight

I know that you've been hurting
The pain's in your eyes
I promise you I'm changing, I feel it inside
I don't know what I would do if it all passes by
We gotta hold on to our love tonight

'Cause now that I've found that someone I believe in
And I feel so complete by your side
It's the only time I've ever loved somebody, baby, in my life
We gotta hold on to our love tonight

Some things in life we should treasure
When you find love, never let it go
Because now I realise and I want you to know

'Cause now that I've found that someone I believe in
And I feel so complete by your side
It's the only time I've ever loved somebody, baby, in my life
We gotta hold on to our love tonight

'Cause now that I've found that someone I believe in
And I feel so complete by your side
It's the only time I've ever loved ѕomebody, baby, in my life
We gotta hold on to our love tonight
We gottа hold on to our love tonight
