My Galileo

I'm no stay-at-home, and heady
Is my quest and venture mode
And the road is there to tread it
All-dimensional road

Round I go, desperate to reach new horizons
Circles grow, but you…

You're my pier, centre in my life
My Galileo - I rotate to you, I'm here

Wind is high and branches rattle
On the shuttered window pane
And the dust has not yet settled
I'm leavin' again

Round I go, desperate to reach new horizons
Circleѕ grow, but you…

You're my pier, centre in my life
My Galileo - I rotate to you, I'm here
I'm here again

(Hey la la… hey la la… hey la…)
(Hey la la… hey la la… hey la…)

My Galileo
(Hey la la… hey la la… hey la…)
(Hey la la… hey la la… hey la…)

You're my pier, centre in my life
(Hey la la… hey la la… hey la…)
My Galileo - I rotate to you, I'm here
(Hey la la… hey la la… hey la…)
I'm here again

I'm here agаin
