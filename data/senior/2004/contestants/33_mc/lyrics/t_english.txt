Our planet

Take care of our planet
There are so many things to save
The madness of people, the storms have damaged it

Ooh ah oh… oh… ooh oh…

Who remembers the virgin coasts
And white paradises?
Who remembers the blue oceans
Whales and their songs?

In this world where nothing more is sacred
So far from our values
Before the desert wipes out
Our dreams of colours

Take care of our planet
There are so many things to save
May the madness of people stop
May our children be able to dream

Their eyes turned to the stars
Their hands stretched to the sky
May the winds carry their sails
May our steps guide their wings

Ooh ah whoa…

We have constructed prisons of glass
On forests of ashes
We have transformed our universe
Without trying to understand it

On our beaches flows ink
This is the blood of the earth
May those who give us orders
Hear our prayers

We dream of a paradise on earth
Oh… we dream

Their eyes turned to the stars
Their hands stretched to the sky
May the winds carry their sails
May our steps guide their wingѕ

Take care of our plаnet
