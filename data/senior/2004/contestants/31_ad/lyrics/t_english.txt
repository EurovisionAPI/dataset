We'll play we're loving each other

I have no doubts, neither of us knows
Why we are together tonight
You don't know my name
And truly, I don't know your name either

Maybe it's better to think about nothing
Let's make the most of being alone
Let's forget all our problems
And let's enjoy this moment

Tonight we'll make it our night
(Tonight… our… ah ah…)
Tonight we'll be able to be whatever we want
While we wait for the sun to rise

I want us to be together, that we don't stop playing
I want you to tell me "I love you", even though it's not true
I want us to embrace each other, that we enjoy this moment
And play… we'll play we're loving each other

And when tomorrow the sun gets you out of bed
I won't be by your side anymore
You will just be a memory
The dream of a midsummer night

That night that we both had
So far from all reality
A night that we're living now
And we want it to last forever

Where nothing matters, but us
(But us… nothing matters… ah ah…)
Tonight everything's permitted, I'll be whoever you want
While the sun doesn't turn up

I want us to be together, that we don't stop playing
I want you to tell me "I love you", even though it's not true
I want us to embrace each other, that we enjoy this moment
And play… we'll play we're loving each other

I want us to be together, that we don't stop playing
I want you to tell me "I love you", even though it's not true
I want us to embrace each other, that we enjoy this moment
And play… we'll play we're loving each other

We are not in a hurry
But don't waste time
Because when the sun rises
The magic will disappear

The night is long
But we must make the most of it
I'll be whoever you want
Until the sun rises
Until the sun rises

I want us to be together, that we don't stop playing
I want you to tell me "I love you", even though it's not true
I want us to embrace each other, that we enjoy this moment
And play… we'll play we're loving each other

I want us to be together, that we don't stop playing
I want you to tell me "I love you", even though it's not true
I want us to embrace each other, that we enjoy this moment
And play… we'll play we're loving eаch other

Until the sun   riseѕ
