Can't Wait Until Tonight

Don't wanna talk about the way I am
I only try to make you understand
That my affection is so really true
My heart has started thumpin' since I met you

Just can't wait until tonight, baby
Till I have you by my side, baby
Just can't wait until tonight, baby
For being with you

Do do do do do…
Just been waiting
Do do do do do…
Just been waiting
Do do do do do…
For being with you

First time I saw you, it just knocked me down
The way you smiled has turned my life around
I never thought that it would catch me so
I'll get my head together and I want you to know

Bekleyemem akşama kadar, canım
Seni kollarımda tutmak için, canım
Bekleyemem akşama kadar, canım
Seninle olmak için
Oh…

True love won't be afraid of no one
True love can lead us through the day
Oh, I'll get my head together
And I want you to say

I just can't wait until tonight, baby
Till I have you by my side, baby
I just can't wait until tonight, my baby
For being with you

Do do do do do…
Just been waiting
Do do do do do…
Just been waiting
Do do do do do…
Juѕt been wаiting
For being with you
