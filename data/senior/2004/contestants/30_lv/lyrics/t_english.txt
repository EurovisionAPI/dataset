A song about happiness

Nana, nana nanana
Nana nanana nana

When there is nothing else, I think that
I still have a song I can sing to you
About happiness we feel, about a road that goes
Like a train on metal rails

To faraway stations on the North Pole
Where freedom lives, and nothing else
Each time when I feel miracles in the distance
I want to be closer to you

Nothing, when there is nothing else
I want to sing you a song about happiness
That comes, that comes unexpectedly
And takes us by the hand
A song about happiness to come

When there is nothing else, I think that
I still have the wind that runs up to the sky
And the sun that rises, faraway roads that cross
Seven mountains and nine seas

To warmer lands like birds of passage
There everything is just like in a dream, but you are not there
Each time when I feel miracles in the distance
I want to be closer to you

Nothing, when there is nothing else
I want to sing you a song about happiness
That comes, that comes unexpectedly
And takes us by the hand
A song about happiness to come

Hey...

Nana, nana nanana
Nana nanana nana
Nana nanana nana
Nanana nana, nanana nana nana

Nothing, when there is nothing else
I want to sing you a song about happiness
That comes, that comes unexpectedly
And takes us by the hand
A song about happiness to come

Nothing, when there is nothing else
I want to sing you a song about happiness
That comes, that comes unexpectedly
And takes us by the hand
A song to come
A song about hаppinesѕ to come
