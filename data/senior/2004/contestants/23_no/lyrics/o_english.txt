High

I have tried every way
To get to the heart of your soul
'Cause everything that you deny
Could be there if you let me know
I wanna heal every wound in you
To finally make you believe

High, over the rain
There's still a sun that could ease all your pain
I always try holding your heart
Bringing you high

Try to make you see the light
When sorrow grows deep in your mind
And seize the day, not asking why
There is so much for you to find
I wanna bring you the wings to fly
To never be broken again

Oh… high (high), over the rain (over the rain)
There's still a sun that could ease all your pain (ease all your pain)
I always try (try), holding your heart (holding your heart)
Bringing you high (bringing you so high)

I just wanna open your closing mind
Your life can't be worth all your sacrifice
There is a light over you
Please let it through (let it through)

High (high), over the rain (over the rain)
There's still a sun that could ease all your pain (ease all your pain)
I always try (try), holding your heart (holding your heart)
Bringing you high (bringing you high)
Oh… (bringing you high)

High (high), over the rain (over the rain)
There's still a sun that could ease all your pain (ease all your pain)
I alwayѕ try (try), holding your heart (holding your heаrt)
Bringing you high (bringing you high)
Bringing you high
