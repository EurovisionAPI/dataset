Shame on you

(Na na na…)

We've been together for the longest time
I always thought that I could read your mind
But lately we've been like two actors in a show
And I wonder, where's the loving that we used to know?

I hoped that everything would be all right
That you would be forever by my side
But all the feelings and the luck we used to share
Now it seems to me it's gone and that you just don't care

You're my fire, you're my desire, shame on you
Can't you see that we have gone too far?
Don't you leave me, don't you deceive me, shame on you
I just want to be where you are

You know I love you, though you cheat on me
You try to hide it, but it's plain to see
Make up your mind, 'cause I can't take it anymore
Won't you turn to me and tell me what you're waiting for?

You're my fire, you're my desire, shame on you
Can't you see that we have gone too far?
Don't you leave me, don't you deceive me, shame on you
I just want to be where you are

(Na na na…)

You're my fire, you're my desire, shame on you
Can't you see that we have gone too far?
Don't you leave me, don't you deceive me, shame on you
I just want to be where you are

You're my fire, you're my desire, shame on you
Can't you see that we have gone too far?
Don't you leave me, don't you deceive me, shame on you
I just want to be where you are

You're my fire, you're my desire, shame on you
Can't you see that we have gone too far?
Don't you leave me, don't you deceive me, shame on you
I juѕt want to be where you аre
