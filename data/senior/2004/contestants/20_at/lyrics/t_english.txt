You are

This silence that I have
Everytime when you are with me
This pure fantasy
This power that you just give

These little moments of luck
That you so often give me
That's when words always fail me
Because there is nothing without you

If you are sad, I'm crying along with you
If you are sleeping, I'm dreaming along with you

You are the life that I love
You have the laughter that I need
You are the star on the starry sky
And all the other beautiful things too

You are the power that surrounds me
You are the warmth, you are the light
And anything else that I need
You are that too

You are a total optimist
For you borders are unknown
For you every wish is a goal
And all dreams come true

If you are sad, I'm crying along with you
If you are sleeping, I'm dreaming along with you

You are the life that I love
You have the laughter that I need
You are the star on the starry sky
And all the other beautiful things too

You are the power that surrounds me
You are the warmth, you are the light
And anything else that I need
You are that too

The air that gives me my breath
The wonder that is called life
The water that keeps me from dying of thirst
You are all that in one

You are the life that I love
You have the laughter that I need
You are the star on the starry sky
And all the other beautiful things too

You are the power that surrounds me
You are the warmth, you are the light
And anything elѕe that I need
You are thаt too
