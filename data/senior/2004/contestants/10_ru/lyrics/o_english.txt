Believe me

Believe me, I just don't care
If you look away or stare,
If you choose to go or stay
Don't believe me, I pray

In my head – every day, everywhere – oh, no
You and I can talk, and I sound colder
In my heart, though I say I don't care
I just cry and cry on your big shoulder

Believe me, I just don't care
If you look away or stare
If you choose to go or stay
Don't believe me, I pray

Believe me, I just don't care
If you look away or stare
If you choose to go or stay
Don't believe me, I pray

Far away, like the man in the moon, my dear
You just wave to me, you're always lying
Every face, every voice, every tune
Brings you back to me, and I start crying

Believe me, I just don't care
If you look away or stare
If you choose to go or stay
Don't believe me, I pray

Believe me, I just don't care
If you look away or stare
If you choose to go or stay
Don't believe me, I pray

Believe me, I juѕt don't cаre
