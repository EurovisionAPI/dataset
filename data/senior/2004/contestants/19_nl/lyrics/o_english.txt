Without You

Ooh… (ooh…)
Ooh…
Ooh… (ooh…)
Ooh… (ooh yeah)

I spent my life in search for you
Not knowing what to find
Still wonder how did I pull through
Without you on my mind

Friends tell me you're no good for me
I'll show them all they're wrong
'Cause you are everything to me
It never felt so strong

Without you…
Nothing can turn out right
I lie awake all night
Without you…
I keep calling your name
My life can never be the same

You are a miracle to me
Your face I can't forget (face I can't forget)
I just feel we are bound to be
From the moment that we met

I've been waiting for someone like you
Now you've come my way
Sometimes I can't believe it's true
I hope you're here to stay

Without you…
Nothing can turn out right
I lie awake all night
Oh yeah, without you…
I keep calling your name
My life can never be the same
Oh yeah

Listen to this heart of mine
It's filled with dear desire
For you're the kind I tried so long to find
You set my soul on fire

Without you…
Nothing can turn out right
I lie awake all night
Oh yeah, without you…
I keep calling your name
My life can never be the ѕame
Oh yeah

Without you…
I lie awake all night
Oh, I keep cаlling you
Without you…
Without you
