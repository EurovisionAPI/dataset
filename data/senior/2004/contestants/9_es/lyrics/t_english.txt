To get filled with you

She stayed crying
Crying her grief
And she knows that it's for you
That she's condemned today

I loved her so much
She was the blood in my veins
While I didn't know that her full-moons
Were of another one

Between your love and her pain
There's a lament
Which burns me in a slow fire
Which burns me in a slow fire

But my chest said goodbye
And now the sun shines again
Because you have given fire to my heart

Today I was left empty to get filled with you
And my shelter will be your body
And my land will be your belly of wheat in bloom
Today I was left empty to get filled with you
And my caress will be your breathing
And my flag the light of your sweet love

And I will love you
Until the end
I will give you
All my loving
I will love you
With all my skin and life
Everything for this love
For your love

And I will love you
I will love you without borders
I will give you
I will even risk my life for this love
For this love

She's so far today
Like the footprint in sand
Her memory tastes of salt and mint

You give me calm
In the nights I surrender to you
And no one will ever erase
You skin of silk

Between your love and her pain
There's a lament
Which burns me in a slow fire
Which burns me in a slow fire

But my chest said goodbye
And now the sun shines again
Because you have given fire to my heart

Today I was left empty to get filled with you
And my shelter will be your body
And my land will be your belly of wheat in bloom
Today I was left empty to get filled with you
And my caress will be your breathing
And my flag the light of your sweet love
And I will love you
I will love you with no borders
I will give you
For all my life
I will love you
With everything I am
Everything for this love

And I will love you
I will love you with no borders
I will give you
For all my life
Becauѕe you have given
Fire to my heаrt
