Life

I saw my ID and it wasn't me
It was someone else's identity
Why do I need to prove myself
And who is the judge of my sanity?

Roaming through my old emotions
I find new feelings of misery
I bet with my soul to get back the truth
Where I will face reality

Life is a book and you gotta read it
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You've got to know how to live it

Life is a book and you gotta read it
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You've got to know how to live it

Walking around, some thoughts on my mind
I search for a place where I'll be free
From all that is said and all that's been done
It'll be hard to find it inside of me

Life is a book and you gotta read it
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You've got to know how to live it

(Life is a book and you gotta read it)
Oh… life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You've got to know how to live it

I know that I've gotta try
No one can see me cry
I can't take it anymore
I must find a way to let myself go, yeah

Oh yeah
(Life is a… life is… life is…)
(Life is a… life is… life is…)
It's true, you know it, don't you?

Life is a book and you gotta read it
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You've got to know how to live it

(Life is a book and you gotta read it)
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You've got to know how to live it

(Life is a book and you gotta read it)
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gottа ѕing it
You've got to know how to live it
