If My World Stopped Turning

I can see my future
When I'm looking in your eyes
And I can sense security
Just by you bein' in my life

I hear a voice inside my head
Say you're an angel in disguise
Without you I feel hopeless
Without you I'm deprived

I wish I could describe it
All the love I feel inside
Maybe I can find the words
That will make you realise

My life seems near perfect
When I've got you in my arms
'Cause that's when I feel wholesome
That's when I'm with you

And if my world stopped turning in the morning
And if God should take this all away
If it all should stop without a warning
Then I would still stand tall
'Cause behind it all
You're the one who's made a winner out of me

All day I long to touch you
And it comes as a surprise
That we spent so long apart
Even more than I survived

Now, if I'm speaking frankly
There's only one thing I can say
It's that I'm fallin' for you, baby
Fallin' further every day

And if my world stopped turning in the morning
And if God should take this all away
If it all should stop without a warning
Then I would still stand tall
'Cause behind it all
You're the one who's made a winner out of me

(If my world stopped) turning in the morning
In the morning
(And if God) should take this all away
If it all should stop without a warning
Then I would still stand tall
'Cause behind it all
You're the one who'ѕ made а winner out of me
