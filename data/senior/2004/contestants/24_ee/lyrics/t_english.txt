Road

I woke up this morning
At the call of the cockerel
I went and left the gate open
Let others follow

I can't sleep, the road runs straight ahead
We're not going around
The speed is such that I see my toes
Where the horizon is

Ravine, wood-path, over river, over hill
I don't know where life will turn
Ravine, wood-path, over river, over hill
I don't know where life will turn

Yesterday we were here
And today we came
And tomorrow we'll go again
The sun shines
Always in our heart
And we feel good wherever we are

Today we came
We're not silly
And tomorrow we'll go again
The sun shines
Always in our heart
And we feel good wherever we are

And today we came
And tomorrow we'll go again
The sun shines
Always in our heart
And we feel good wherever we are

Today we came
We're not silly
And tomorrow we'll go again
The sun shines
Alwayѕ in our heart
And we feel good wherever we are

Ravine, wood-pаth, over river, over hill
I don't know where life will turn
