What About My Dreams?

I always stood behind you, always close
Stood by your side, no matter what the cost
And I always was there for you when you called
Should I live all my life for only your cause?

What about my life? What about my dreams?
What about how I feel? What about my needs?
I can't hold back, I can't go back, I must be free
What about how I feel? What about my life?

(I can't) Can't
(Hold back) Back
(No more)
(I can't) I can't
(Hold back) Hold back
(No more)

Ten steps, a hundred steps, I need distance
No matter where, just far from you, away
What could you say, what could I say
We got worn out, the light from our eyes, where has it gone?

What about my life? What about my dreams?
What about how I feel? What about my needs?
I can't hold back, I can't go back, I must be free
What about how I feel? What about my life?

(I can't hold back) Gonna live my dreams
(I won't go back) Oh, my dreams
(I need to be all I can be) Gonna live my life
(I can't hold back) I can't go back
(I won't go back) I must be free
(I need to be all I can be) What about my dreаmѕ?
