What About My Dreams?

I always stood behind you, always close
Stood by your side, no matter what the cost
And I always was there for you when you called
Should I live all my life for only your cause?

What about my life? What about my dreams?
What about how I feel? What about my needs?
I can't hold back, I can't go back, I must be free
What about how I feel? What about my life?

(I can't) Can't
(Hold back) Back
(No more)
(I can't) I can't
(Hold back) Hold back
(No more)

Tíz lépés, száz lépés távolság kell
Nem számít merre csak el, tőled el
Mit mondhatnál, mit mondhatnék
Elkoptunk rég, szemeinkből nézd, hova tűnt a fény?

What about my life? What about my dreams?
What about how I feel? What about my needs?
I can't hold back, I can't go back, I must be free
What about how I feel? What about my life?

(I can't hold back) Gonna live my dreams
(I won't go back) Oh, my dreams
(I need to be all I can be) Gonna live my life
(I can't hold back) I can't go back
(I won't go back) I must be free
(I need to be all I can be) What about my dreаmѕ?
