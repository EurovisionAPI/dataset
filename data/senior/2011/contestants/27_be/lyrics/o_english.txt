With Love Baby

(With love) Hey… with love
(With love, love, love) You gotta do it with love, love
(With love)

In my mind, my body and my soul
I'm doing everything and I'm doing it all (With love)
In my mind, my body and my soul
With love, baby, you can have it all

If you like to move it, if you like to groove it
Do it with love, baby
If you like to sing it, if you like to swing it
Do it with love, baby

'Cause when your love is gone and you're all alone
There is nothing left to carry on
So whenever we're singing this song
We do it with love, baby, with love

In my mind, my body and my soul
I'm doing everything and I'm doing it all (With love)
In my mind, my body and my soul
With love, baby, you can have it all

(With love) With love, baby
(With love) With love, baby
(With love) With love, baby
Oh, whatever you're doing, just do it with love

You gotta do it with love, with love
Come on and sing it, swing it with love
Feel it in your body, your soul and your mind
When you move, when you groove, with love

We'll break it down now
One, two… bring the bass back

Yes, I had to sing it and I came to bring it to you
With love, baby
Then I tried to blend it, but I have to end it for you
With love, baby
'Cause when I love you and you love me too
There is nothing left for us to do
But to hug and to kiss and to tug into bliss
With love, baby, with love

In my mind, my body and my soul
I'm doing everything and I'm doing it all (With love)
In my mind, my body and my soul
With love, baby, you can have it all

(With love) With love, baby
(With love) With love, baby
(With love) With love, baby
Oh, whatever you're doing, just do it with love

In my mind, my body and my soul
I'm doing everything and I'm doing it all
In my mind, my body and my soul
With love, baby, you can have it all

With love, baby
(With love) With love, baby
(With love) With love, baby
Oh, whаtever you're doing, juѕt do it…
With love
