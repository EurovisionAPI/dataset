Get You

I choose my words like wise men do
And tonight I'll get you right
I rule my world like great men do
And I fight, I fight for mine

And you look so good on the floor
Put my mind in a dirty zone
If they watch, let them watch
Not losing you tonight

Oh oh… I'm coming to get you
Oh oh… I'm running, I'm gunning for you
Oh oh… I'm gonna get you
I know you, you want me to

I lost my mind somewhere between your face
And your perfect shape
I found a pleasure watching you having fun
Fooling around

And you look so good on the floor
Put my mind in a dirty zone
If they talk, let them talk
Not losing you tonight

Oh oh… I'm coming to get you
Oh oh… I'm running, I'm gunning for you
Oh oh… I'm gonna get you
I know you, you want me to

Girl, you blow me away, want you here with me
Girl, you blow me away, I want you to ѕtay, yeah yeah

Oh oh oh… oh oh yeah… oh oh oh…
I know you want me to

Oh oh… I'm coming to get you
Oh oh… I'm running, I'm gunning for you
Oh oh… I'm gonna get you
I know you, you want me to, yeаh
