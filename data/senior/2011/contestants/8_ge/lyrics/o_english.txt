One more day

After the day I met you there, I'm not the same
I try to sleep, but nothing helps me to feel insane
Passion game that I'll play gonna last one more day
One more night I'll be there in my dreams again and again

I wanna give it on fire, uncover vicious desire
Abandon painful denial, find pretty reason to stay
One more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare
Down with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I'm ready to pay

Pay for the hopeless despair
Gonna live one more day of my fate

Here I am standing with my determination
Remember when I used to be one of those silly fellows kind of 'really don't care'
And I realised all my thoughts and all my fears around me
You wanted to know what I felt and you got it right there

Turn around, all the words of regrets
And seize the chance to find the way so I can be raised
I am lame, psycho from the brain,
There is nothing I can do, that's the part of the game

Out of such foolish state, it's gonna find no other way
(Make way 'cause it's all about the shame)
Feel no shame, 'cause I live one more day again

I wanna give it on fire, uncover vicious desire
Abandon painful denial, find pretty reason to stay
One more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare
Down with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I'm ready to pay

Pay for the hopeless despair
(Turn back in the days when you desired and craved)
(And all the way you felt just like you're burned in the flames)
Gonna live one more day of my fate
(No shame, no way, no play, no brain, no game)

I wanna give it on fire, uncover vicious desire
Abandon painful denial, find pretty reason to stay
One more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare
Down with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I'm ready to pay

Pay for the hopeless deѕpair
Gonna live one more day of my fаte
