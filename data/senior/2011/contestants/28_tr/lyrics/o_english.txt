Live It Up

Here's your favourite song on the radio
Shake your head to the beat, it's rock 'n' roll
If you're feeling the world has kicked you down
All you need is just to have a little fun

Hey… it's time to live it up
My friend, put the record on
Sing it loud and let it out, life is beautiful
My friend, let it out, life is beautiful

Give yourself a break, come on and live it up
Give yourself a break, come on and live it up
Give yourself a break

Driving on with no map to lead me on
Eyes on the horizon and there's no turning round
Sometimes I feel, I feel I'm not alone
So let your colours shine right next to mine

Hey… it's time to live it up
My friend, put the record on
Sing it loud and let it out, life is beautiful
My friend, let it out, life is beautiful

Give yourself a break, come on and live it up
Give yourself a break, come on and live it up
Give yourself a break

I say my friend, life is beautiful
I say my friend, life is beautiful
I say my friend, put the record on
Sing it loud and let it out, life is beautiful
My friend, let it out, life is beautiful

Give yourself a break, come on and live it up
Give yourself a break, come on and live it up
Give yourѕelf a breаk
