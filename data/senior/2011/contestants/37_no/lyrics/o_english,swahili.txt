Haba haba

Haba haba hujaza kibaba

When as a little girl, my grandma told me
That I could be just anything that I wanted to
When as a little girl, my grandma told me
That I could be just anything that I wanted to

She said that
Everything I work for, everything I wish for
Everything I look for, it is right in front of me
Everything I work for, everything I wish for
Everything I look for, it is right in front of me

And she said ah
Haba haba hujaza kibaba
Haba haba hujaza kibaba

When as a little girl, my grandma told me
That it's the little things in life that's gon' make me happy
When as a little girl my grandma told me
That it's the little things in life that's gon' make me happy

She said that
Little by little fills up the measure
Don't ever give up, keep on moving
Little by little fills up the measure
Don't ever give up, keep on moving
