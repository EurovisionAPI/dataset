Boom Boom

My days and nights are passing, long hours are running
But we are still fighting – ay ay ay
The love is still so shining, why are we denying?
I really don't know why – ay ay ay

Come and take my hand, now don't be shy (Don't be shy)
And let's try to hold our spirits high (Spirits high)

Boom boom, chucka chucka, your kiss is like a, like a
Boom boom, chucka chucka, your love is like a, like a
I wanna say that one thing is true (True)
I'm in love with you

Boom boom, chucka chucka, your kiss is like a, like a
Boom boom, chucka chucka, your love is like a, like a
I wanna say that one thing is true (True)
I'm in love with you

I know that love cannot lie, I wanna give you a new try
So there's no need to cry – ay ay ay
And if you want, we can fly, high up to the sky
Just you and I – ay ay ay ay

Come and take my hand, now don't be shy
And let's try to hold our spirits high

Boom boom, chucka chucka, your kiss is like a, like a
Boom boom, chucka chucka, your love is like a, like a
I wanna say that one thing is true (True)
I'm in love with you

Boom boom, chucka chucka, your kiss is like a, like a
Boom boom, chucka chucka, your love is like a, like a
I wanna say that one thing is true (True)
I'm in love with you

You are the strongest fighter
You're the king for me (I'm in love with you)
It's time to win me in the ring of love, baby
Baby, boom

Boom boom, chucka chucka, your kiss is like a, like a
Boom boom, chucka chucka, your love is like a, like a
I wanna say that one thing is true (True)
