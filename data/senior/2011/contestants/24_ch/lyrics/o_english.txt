In Love For A While

I looked into your eyes, and when I saw your smile
I knew right from the start: life is good for a while
Romance comes and goes, but a love like ours is here to stay
Each lovely night and sunny day

I love everything about you, I couldn't do without you
Whenever you're near me, all my days are on the bright side
But when I'm not around you, I have to find the way
To be with you each night and every day

Na nanana nanana… na nanana nanana…
Na nanana nananana… na nananana…
Na nanana nanana… na nanana nanana…
Nanana nanana nanana…

And as time goes by and we've seen stormy weather
I know that you and I, we're alwayѕ getting better
But when I'm not around you, I have to find the way
To be with you each night and every day

Oh, I couldn't do without you, yeah
I have to find the way to… to be with you, no oh no no oh…
I love everything you do
I have to find the way to be with you

I know you and I are in love for а while
