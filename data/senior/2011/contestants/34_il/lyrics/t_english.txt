Ding dong

And maybe the better days
Have arrived here, just a short moment
And everything will change from now on
And we'll love, we'll love

And if you have a dream of your own
Don't be afraid to go on with your heart
Close your eyes and hear the bells of your soul

Ding dong, say no more
I hear silent prayers
And it's making me high and fly
I know where to go and I'm coming now

And maybe it's almost, it's close
Now comes the turn of the good moment
The pain in the heart turns and goes, leaves

Ding dong, say no more
I hear silent prayers
And it's making me high and fly
I know where to go and I'm coming now

Praise the day that brings you the night
Praise the time that will light you
It will bring you redemption

Praise the day that brings you the night
Praise the time that will light you
And bring you redemption

Ding dong, say no more
I hear silent prayers
And it's making me high and fly
I know where to go and I'm coming

Ding dong, say no more
I hear silent prayers
And it'ѕ making me high and fly
I know where to go аnd I'm coming now
