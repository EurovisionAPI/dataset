Ding dong





And if you have a dream of your own
Don't be afraid to go on with your heart
Close your eyes and hear the bells of your soul

Ding dong, say no more
I hear silent prayers
And it's making me high and fly
I know where to go and I'm coming now





Ding dong, say no more
I hear silent prayers
And it's making me high and fly
I know where to go and I'm coming now





הללי את היום שמביא לך את הלילה
הללי את הזמן שיאיר אותך
ויביא לך גאולה



Ding dong, say no more
I hear silent prayers
And it's making me high and fly
I know where to go and I'm coming

Ding dong, say no more
I hear silent prayers
And it's making me high and fly
I know where to go and I'm coming now
