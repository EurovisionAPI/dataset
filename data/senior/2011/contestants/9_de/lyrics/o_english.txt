Taken by a stranger

She's got a knuckle in her eye
He knows her catcall
Can't escape from telling lies
I heard her sayin':

"Hey, mind if I take this chair?"
"Hey, mind if I take this chair?"

He drops a pause
She looks annoyed
But she's so mean
He thinks she has to be the one

Taken by a stranger
Stranger things are startin' to begin
Lured into the danger
Trip me up and spin me round again

You got some coffee on your collar
And you forgot to comb your hair
I can't wait till I do better
You're here and I don't care
Can't help it if you like it 'cause I won't be here tomorrow
No one ever told you that you wouldn't be rejected

Taken by a stranger
Stranger things are startin' to begin
Lured into the danger (Danger is a risky business)
Trip me up and spin me round again

Dada dada dada da…
Ooh… la la la la la…
