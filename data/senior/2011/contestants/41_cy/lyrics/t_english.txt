I loved you like an angel

I walk alone at my lonely galleries
The road is long and wherever you guide me, I will go
You crucified me, you made me bleed even when I was dying for you
My tears flowed like blood, forgotten words

I used to believe that angels live in our dreams
But I used to believe in lies, they live among us
A desolate heart when you went away from me
Come back, I'm waiting for you, my star and my happiness

In the garden of our love I tried to find you
But you hid in the crowd and I could not cry
The crossroads of the soul, and our secret supper
Lost on our path, the circle has been closed now

I loved you like an angel, come back to my embrace
Tell me one more time that you love me, redeem my heart
I loved you like an angel, come back to my embrace
Come again and guide my wildernesѕ to the light

I loved you like an angel
I loved you like an аngel
