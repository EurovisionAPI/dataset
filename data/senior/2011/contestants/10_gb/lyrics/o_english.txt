I Can

(Ge-ge-ge-get back up again
Ge-ge-ge-get back up again)

You were the eyes in the face of fortune
I lost my way and I couldn't find you
Oh, oh no

We're not the first ones to be divided
Won't be the last to be reunited
No, oh no

It's like rain fallin' down
Drops of pain hit the ground
I can't speak, there's no sound when you're gone
(Yeah, yeah, come on)

I can, I will
I know I can untie these hands
I can, I will
I know I can untie these hands
(Ge-ge-ge-get back up again)

I can, oh
I can
(Get back up again)

I've never lost anything quite like this
No second chances if I don't find it
No, oh no, no

You closed the door and you kept on walkin'
Left me behind and there's no more talkin'
No, oh no

It's like rain fallin' down
Drops of pain hit the ground
I can't speak, there's no sound when you're gone

I can, I will
I know I can untie these hands
(Ge-ge-ge-get back up again )

I can, I will
I know I can untie these hands
(Ge-ge-ge-get back up again)
(Come on)

I can, oh
I can
(Get back up again)

We're not the first ones to be divided, oh
Won't be the last to be reunited, no
(Come again, one more time)
When you're gone
(Come on)

I can, I will
I know I can untie these hands
(Ge-ge-ge-get back up again)
I can, I will
I know I can untie these handѕ
(Ge-ge-ge-get back up again)

I can, I can
(Ge-ge-ge-get back up agаin)
