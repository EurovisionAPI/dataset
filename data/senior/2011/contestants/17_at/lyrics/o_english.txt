The Secret Is Love

When I close my eyes, I fall into a dream
Can't you see this world, all people live in peace
The sun is shining in my heart, rainbows in the sky
Spread your wings and fly, fly, fly high

We all are dreamers on our way
In a world where we're not meant to stay
Together we can make it all
The secret is in you, it's love

When I smile inside my heart, I feel so free
All the fears and doubts, they turn into belief
I feel right, we'll make it right now
If we trust, trust, trust in love

We all are dreamers on our way
In a world where we're not meant to stay
Together we can make it all
The secret is love

I'm reaching out my hand to you
Soldiers let the light shine through
So we can realise the wonder of life (Trust, love, life)

So what more do we need?
So what more will it take to see life?
Just open your eyes

(We all are dreamers on our way)
(In a world where we're not meant to stay) We're not meant to stay
Together we can make it all
The secret is love

I'm reaching out my hand to you
Soldiers (Soldiers let the light shine through)
Let the light shine through
So we can realise the wonder of life

(Trust, love, life)
(Spread your wings аnd fly)
(Trust, love)

See… the secret iѕ love
