Madness Of Love

Saying yes, saying never is not easy, you know
And all the world around you seems to slip and disappear
I no longer know who you are, I don't care who you are
I know for certain I won't bother you with nostalgia

But you'll see another me in a fragile dream
You'll laugh as if I had never loved you
You'll look for another me beyond the shadow of a coffee
You'll only find me
If I stop for a moment, I no longer know who you are

Here we live like this, day by day, night by night
But someone hit me and I fell into your heart, my dear
And you'll fly over lands where your eyes can't find the end
Up on mountains, down lanes
Being so far away from you just makes me feel so damned

And you will see another you, almost invincible
Alive as ever and it is there where you will have me
You'll be the horizon beyond all the false mаgic
You'll shine, you'll shine, you'll shine, you'll ѕhine
