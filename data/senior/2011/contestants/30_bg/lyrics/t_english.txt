For spite

I know I'll find the strength inside me
To achieve as much as I can, yeah…

They won't break everything inside of me
They won't see me broken again
There is no way they will get to me, yeah yeah…

They won't find the way to me
They won't take away my belief
They want to look over me again, no no…

But I know I'll find the strength in me
And reach the sky, for spite, for spite
Oh yes, I know the power will be with me
To achieve as much as I can
To achieve as much as I can

There is so much love inside me
There is still a point in staying
And we find the will every day, yeah yeah…

There are people like you and me
We will stay – for spite we fight on
Who does it depend on? Yes, on you and me, yeah…

But I know you'll find the strength in me
And we will reach the sky, for spite, for spite
Oh yes, I know the power will be with you
To achieve as much as we can
To achieve as much as we can

Yes… He is there and gives us, He gives us
Strength, courage to move forward

But I know I'll find the strength in me
And we will reach the sky, for spite, we are here again
Oh, yes, I know the power will be with you
To achieve as much as we can
To achieve as much as we can

I see it makes sense
To fight with you, and you know
How much we can achieve
Yeѕ, we can аchieve it
