Stand by

Oh, the sea: waves of eternity, waves of serenity
As I stare through them, all around me just dies
Tonight, can we pretend there's no more time?
Let's lock our doors and leave this endless world outside

But if you don't mind, I will be here
Holding back those years that pass us by
And in a natural high you'll hold my hand, we'll take a breath
So tonight, if you don't mind, I will stand by

Oh, this life, something so beautiful but hard at the same time
Taught me it could be gone in a blink of an eye
Tonight, can we pretend there's no more time?
Let's lock our doors and leave this endless world outside

If you don't mind, I will be here
Holding back those years that pass us by
And in a natural high you'll hold my hand, we'll take a breath
So tonight, if you don't mind, I will stand by

(I will be here) Holding back, holding back
(Those years that pass us by)
And in a natural high you'll hold my hand, we'll take a breath
So tonight, if you don't mind, I will ѕtаnd by
