I love Belarus

Yeah yeah yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah yeah yeah…

I'm feeling great and it's easy to be strong
When all the hearts keep on beating as one
The sky is blue and I'm writing a new song
Saying that I'm free, friendly and young

I have so much and I'm ready to show you
Let's come together, so here is my hand
We're gonna fly watching lakes in their full view
Fields are full of gold, and it's all my land

I love Belarus, got it deep inside
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind
And I wanna see the sun shining from above
You will always be the one, I can't get enough

I love Belarus, got it deep inside
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind
And I wanna see the sun shining from above
And I'm gonna every day give you all my love

So here I go and I'm ready to rise up
Just like a star guiding me through the night
I've got no fear and I will never give up
Love is all we need and it's our light

I love Belarus, got it deep inside
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind
And I wanna see the sun shining from above
You will always be the one, I can't get enough

I love Belarus, got it deep inside
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind
And I wanna see the sun shining from above
And I'm gonna every day give you all my love

Time will not erase courage and my grace
I'm stronger every day, I say…
(I love Belarus, I love Belarus)
You will always be the one, I can't get enough

I love Belarus, got it deep inside
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind
And I wanna see the sun shining from above
And I'm gonna every day give you all my love

I love Belаruѕ
