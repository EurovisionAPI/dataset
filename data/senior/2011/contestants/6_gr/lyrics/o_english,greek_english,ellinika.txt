Watch my dance

I was born so betrayed – who am I, what I'll be?
What is mine in this life? Just the heaven and sea
No, I won't give them up, they're my fortune, my proof
Don't believe what you hear 'cause the truth kills your truth
The duty I've got is my war against fear
And I want you with me, yes, I want you so near

Watch my dance, head up high, hands like wings and I'll fly
To kefali psila ke ta herya anihta

Tin ehi i psihi mu ti fotya
Tus fovus olus kei monadhika
Ta vimata mu kano os to Theo
Ki an peso ego xana tha sikotho

I have heard many words, but I still won't forget
The language of my body, the sound my heart makes
So I'm staying alive and my losses won't let
My soul to surrender, the power of loss is my bet

Watch my dance, head up high, hands like wings and I'll fly
To kefali psila ke ta herya anihta

Tin ehi i psihi mu ti fotya
Tus fovus olus kei monadhika
Ta vimata mu kano os to Theo
Ki an peso ego xana tha sikotho

Tin ehi i psihi mu ti fotya
Tus fovus olus kei monadhika
Ta vimata mu kano os to Theo
Ki an peso ego xana thа ѕikotho
