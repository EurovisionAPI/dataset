Watch my dance

I was born so betrayed – who am I, what I'll be?
What is mine in this life? Just the heaven and sea
No, I won't give them up, they're my fortune, my proof
Don't believe what you hear 'cause the truth kills your truth
The duty I've got is my war against fear
And I want you with me, yes, I want you so near

Watch my dance, head up high, hands like wings and I'll fly
Head up high and open arms

My soul has the fire
That burns all fears individually
I'm making steps toward God
And if I ever fall, I'll get up again

I have heard many words, but I still won't forget
The language of my body, the sound my heart makes
So I'm staying alive and my losses won't let
My soul to surrender, the power of loss is my bet

Watch my dance, head up high, hands like wings and I'll fly
Head up high and open arms

My soul has the fire
That burns all fears individually
I'm making steps toward God
And if I ever fall, I'll get up again

My soul has the fire
That burns all fears individually
I'm making stepѕ toward God
And if I ever fall, I'll get up agаin
