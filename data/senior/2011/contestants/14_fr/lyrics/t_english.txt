I Dream

I dream of these lips
Of this clear and pure voice
The memory of you will never fade
That night here with me

I dream, I wail
My heart is concerned
About the life that awaits me tomorrow
I'm kneeled before the sea

I share the world with you
But you, you want to go away
I sing for victory
Far from you, I always think that
You are close to me, I dream of you

I will sing, Yes I will sing to you
The song, the sorrow

I cry and I feel bad
I pray to heaven until I die
Here on the mountains, here in front of you
I will escape from this dream

If you die, I аlѕo die
