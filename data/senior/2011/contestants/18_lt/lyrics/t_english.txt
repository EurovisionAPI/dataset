This Is My Life

Great is the sorrow
But just look straight for tomorrow
When soon will shine at your face
Don't close your eyes

Those who went through desert
Passed never ending forever
They know my dreams will come true
As I sing to you:

This is my life, i say yes
No more rain around
I know I have found
Everlasting love for life
Love of mine, love the time

Time will give the answers
For all your great tribulation
Soon we'll be playing in the sun
And feel like one

This is my life, i say yes
No more rain around
I know I have found
Everlasting love for life
Love of mine, love that shines, love of time

This is my life, i say yes
No more rain round
I know I have found
Everlasting love for life
Love thаt shines, love of mine
Love of time, love of mine

This iѕ my life
