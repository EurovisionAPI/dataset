Celebrate

Friday, my night
Flashing street lights
Let's get this old town dancing
Leave your troubles behind, oh…

Put your hands up
Let the magic take over your heart
Join us, you'll have a good time
Love is here to stay

Celebrate every single step you take
Stop the world for a moment
Shine like a comet
Nothing can stop you now

Celebrate every single step you take
Stop the world for a moment
Shine like a comet
In our musical galaxy

Friday, late night
We're all just shadows in the moonlight
A thousand drums are beating
Till the break of day

Put your hands up
Let the magic take over your heart
Join us, you'll have a good time
The party of your life

Celebrate every single step you take
Stop the world for a moment
Shine like a comet
Nothing can stop you now

Celebrate every single step you take
Stop the world for a moment
Shine like a comet
In our musical galaxy

Just keep moving and dancing and dancing and dancing
Music will heal your soul
Let's move to the rhythms and beats all around
Until we lose control

Celebrate every single step you take
Stop the world for a moment
Shine like a comet
Nothing can stop you now

Celebrate every single step you take
Stop the world for a moment
Shine like a comet
In our muѕical galaxy
