Nobody can take away the good times I've had

Whoa whoa whoa whoa… whoa whoa whoa whoa…
And now nobody can take away, take away the good times I've had
Whoa whoa whoa whoa… whoa…

I pinch myself every day, thinking how lucky I am
I'm not dreaming, it's reality
I live on cloud number nine, I have what I've never had
I've got you, you, and everything you give me

And though I very well know that storms may come and I will fall
I know at the end of the day, I've enjoyed the good times I've had

Whoa whoa whoa whoa… whoa whoa whoa whoa…
Now nobody can take away, take away the good times I've had
Whoa whoa whoa whoa… whoa whoa whoa whoa…
Now nobody can take away, take away the good times I've had
Para turu turu turu… para turu turu turu tururu… hoho…

Each moment with you, that feeling is sublime
With no fear of what is to come
I won't take precautions, nor will I carry any cross
I'd rather enjoy watching you as you are

And though I very well know that storms may come and I will fall
I know at the end of the day, I've enjoyed the good times I've had

Whoa whoa whoa whoa… whoa whoa whoa whoa…
Now nobody can take away, take away the good times I've had
Whoa whoa whoa whoa… whoa whoa whoa whoa….
Now nobody can take away, take away the good times I've had

I feel so good, I feel so good
That I will never ever ever think negatively

And I very well know that storms will come and I will fall
But at the end of the day, I've already enjoyed the good times I've had

Whoa whoa whoa whoa… whoa whoa whoa whoa…
Now nobody can take away, take away the good times I've had
Whoa whoa whoa whoa… whoa whoa whoa whoa…
Now nobody can take away, take away the good timeѕ I've hаd
