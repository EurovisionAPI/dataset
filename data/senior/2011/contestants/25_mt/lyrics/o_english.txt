One Life

Life's a game, it's a mystery
Which we give in to
Days go by, no lesson learned
Just things that you do

Things change even in my mind
And not in my heart
I am who I am and I'm here for you

One life – show what's in your heart
Love me like I love you
One life – it's all we got to live
Time to set your heart free

Chase the pain away
And move on and don't give up
This time it's all up to you
You can love yourself too

Life is strange and heavenly
Sweet surrender (Surrender)
Love begins within ourselves
Makes up our lives

Hold on to what life brings you
Just be who you are
You can do it too
It's all up to you

One life – show what's in your heart
Love me like I love you
One life – it's all we got to live
Time to set your heart free

Chase the pain away
And move on and don't give up
This time it's all up to you
You can love yourself too

Don't try to judge me
You don't know how I feel
Love me, love me for who I am
My life, I will give it all
I give it all to you, give it all

One life – show what's in your heart
Love me like I love you
One life – it's all we got to live
Time to set your heart free

Chase the pain away
Move on and don't give up
This time it's all up to you
You can love yourself too

It's all up to you
You can love yourself too
It's all up to you
You cаn love yourѕelf too
