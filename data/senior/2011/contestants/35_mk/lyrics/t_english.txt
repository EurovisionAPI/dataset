Russian girl

Pure and white, her skin is so inviting
Like a new, unbeaten snow
Eyes of blue, so beautiful and blinding
Like the sky over Moscow

I'm a Macedonian, she's a Russian girl
I'm welcomed like the music
Music, music
Which I don't understand

Neither "kakalin" nor "kamaja"
I just don't understand any of it
Neither "kakalin" nor "kamaja"
I'll learn it all for her

Neither "kakalin" nor "kamaja"
I just don't understand any of it
Neither "kakalin" nor "kamaja"
I'll learn it all for her

I'm a Macedonian, she's a Russian girl
Give her a vodka, and me a rakia
Music, music
Which I don't understand

Neither "kakalin" nor "kamaja"
I just don't understand any of it
Neither "kakalin" nor "kamaja"
I'll learn it all for her

Lai lai lai la la lai lai lai la la
Lai lai lai la la lai lai lai la la
Lai lai lai la la lai lai lai la la
Lai lai la la lai

Neither "kakalin" nor "kamaja"
I just don't understand any of it
Neither "kakalin" nor "kamaja"
I'll learn it all for her

Neither "kakalin" nor "kamaja"
I just don't underѕtand any of it
Neither "kakalin" nor "kamaja"
I'll learn it all for her

I'll learn it аll for her
