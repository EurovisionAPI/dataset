So lucky

So lucky, so lucky

Flashes, ray ban glasses
I move with ease in my convertible breeze (So lucky)
Martini, whiskey on the rocks
Life on the top, my party never stops (So lucky)

Winner, a dusk to dawn sinner
Love traded in for lust, it's emotions I don't trust (So lucky)
On top, the cream of the crop
You know I love to rock, the fun will never stop (So lucky)

You see, it's all about me
The servants and the king, I'm the ruler of the world (So lucky)
A tug, she pulls me like a drug
I want her on the rug, but she's not that kind of girl (So lucky)

I see you where the lights glow
You pull me in your private side show
And now I see your moves in slo-mo
I try to kiss you, but you slip away

Yet you never walk away from me
Are you a shadow of what might be?
Why should one woman stand above the rest?
There is a mystery to you deep beneath the flesh

(So lucky, so lucky, so lucky, so lucky)

Those eyes pulling me in, a body made to sin
But I can not win  (So lucky)
Wait, I'm ready at the gate, don't tell me it's too late
Her fire starts to melt my heart (So lucky)

She's clean, not part of any scene
She's more like a dream I don't want to wake up from (So lucky)
I see, she's somehow changing me
She's where I want to be, can't stand a moment without her (So lucky)
Anymore

I see you where the lights glow
You pull me in your private side show
And now I see your moves in slo-mo
I try to kiss you, but you slip away

Yet you never walk away from me
Are you a shadow of what might be?
Why should one woman stand above the rest?
There is a mystery to you deep beneаth the fleѕh

So lucky!
