Coming Home

Some say I'm a bit of a fool
Sitting on a hill and counting raindrops
Keep thinking I just wanna go
To the peaceful place I know that I call home

But oh oh oh it's time to go
I'll see you, I'll see you soon

'Cause I can't wait for tomorrow
To say the things I wanna say
Your smile will always lead my way
I can't wait, I'm coming soon
I just wanna see your face again

Some say I'm a bit of a fool
Driving down the road I stop to listen
I hear your laughter in the trees
Your whisper in the breeze: "My love is you"

But oh oh oh it's time to go
I'll see you, I'll see you soon

'Cause I can't wait for tomorrow
To say the things I wanna say
Your smile will always lead my way
I can't wait, I'm coming soon
I just wanna see your face again

'Cause no one knows his where or when
When my time on earth comes to an end
Then I'll find you
And I know that you will be my love again

I can't wait for tomorrow
To say the things I wanna say
Your smile will always lead my way
I can't wait, I'm coming soon
I just wanna see your face again

'Cause I can't wait for tomorrow
To say the things I wanna say
Your smile will always lead my way
I can't wait, I'm coming home to you
I just wanna ѕee your face agаin
I'm coming home
