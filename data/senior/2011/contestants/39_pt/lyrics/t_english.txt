The fight is joy

Sometimes you find yourself depressed
Sometimes you find yourself mistrusting
Sometimes you find yourself startled
Sometimes you find yourself in dispair

Night or day, the fight is joy
And the people move on by shouting in the street

Wearing a tight belt won't help much
To go complaining won't help much
Carrying a gloomy face won't help much
Anger won't help you much

Night or day, the fight is joy
And the people move on by shouting in the street

So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy
So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy
Come celebrate this state of affairs and let's sing against the reaction
Come celebrate this state of affairs and let's sing against the reaction

So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy
So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy

There's always someone warning you to be careful
There's always someone who wants to silence you
There's always someone that leaves you bitter
There's always someone to sell you the air itself

Night or day, the fight is joy
And the people move on by shouting in the street

So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy
So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy

Come celebrate this state of affairs and let's sing against the reaction
Come celebrate this state of affairs and let's sing against the reaction
Come celebrate this state of affairs and let's sing against the reaction
Come celebrate this state of affairs and let's sing against the reaction

So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy
So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine
Here come the elderly and here come the youth аnd the little boy

The fight goes on when people come out to the streetѕ
