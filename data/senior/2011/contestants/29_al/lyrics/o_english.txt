Feel The Passion

Feel my heart, feel the words beat low
I sing my song and the echo flows
And wherever I go, I just want you to know
You're the blood in my veins and the love in my soul

You are my wave rippling over sea
You dry my tears and you make me grieve
But wherever I go, I just want you to know
My moment in time, oh sweet song of mine, eh…

I'm like an eagle in the open sky
I'll never land, I'm flying high

Let me share my song with you, just feel the passion
Love's the message shining through, a chain reaction
It brings my heaven down to earth and this is why
It drives me mad but it gives me life, I'm free to fly, eh…

And when I feel that I thirst for you
I dab my lips with your morning dew
But wherever I go, I just want you to know
Sweet song, live forever and I'll live with you, eh…

I'm like an eagle in the open sky
I'll never land, I'm flying high

Let me share my song with you, just feel the passion
Love's the message shining through, a chain reaction
It brings my heaven down to earth and this is why
It drives me mad but it gives me life, I'm free to fly, eh…

(Let me share my song with you, just feel the passion)
(Love's the message shining through, I'm free to fly)

Zot, qe këngën ma ke fal, më lerë të ndarë
Nuk ka ngjyrë e nuk ka fjalë, muret s'e mbajnë
It brings my heaven down to earth and this is why
It drives me mad but it gives me life, I'm free to fly, eh…

(Let me share my song with you, just feel the pasѕion) Yeаh…
