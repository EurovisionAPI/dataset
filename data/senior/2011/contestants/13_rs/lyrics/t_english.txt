Magical

Freezing winter and damn ice everywhere
I've really had a rough day
People are strange, no one follows the rules
I'm dragging myself home, tired

And while I'm digging through my purse to find the key
Losing my nerve already
My sun, my moon and all the stars
My man opens the door
My man is at the door

And at the same moment I'm worth a thousand women
Because to him I'm beautiful and strong as a rock
And when he holds me, I know everything is fine
The man is magical

He colours all of my darknesses into spring
Ever since he loves me, I stand tall
And for him, I'm good, just the way I am
The man is magical

Farewell to sorrow and hello to my smile
Happiness moved in with him
So warm, gentle and wonderfully himself
He belongs to me only

Long talks, he's my best friend
With him, I'm laughing like crazy
People tell me they haven't seen a couple shining like that
Our love is contagious

Now I know that I'm worth a thousand women
Because to him, I'm beautiful and strong as a rock
And when he holds me, I know everything is fine
The man is magical

He colours all of my darknesses into spring
Ever since he loves me, I stand tall
And for him, I'm good, just the way I am
The man is magical

Now I know (that I'm worth a thousand women)
(And when he holds me, I know everything is fine)
The man is magical

He colours all of my darknesses into spring
Ever since he loves me, I stand tall
And for him, I'm good, just the way I am
