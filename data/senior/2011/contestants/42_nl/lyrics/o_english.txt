Never Alone

Awake your heart
You fear it, but we'll make a start
Seems like the wind just blows your way
With clouds full of rain

And you hide, because the world ain't right
Know that your cold and hurtin' soul
Is never alone

Don't waste your time
Just lift your mind
Imagination comes alive
Now you know that I'll be by your side

Feel the risin' hope and the sky will open
Take my hand, don't stall, have faith
Though the road is long, there are golden gardens
At the sweet end of your trail

Lay down now, I'll ease your heart, erase your frown
To light up the darkness in your dreams
I will be here

And we'll find the freedom you left behind
Capture the sun, the source, it shone
You were never alone

Don't waste your time
Just lift your mind
Imagination comes alive
Now you know that I'll be by your side

Feel the risin' hope and the sky will open
Take my hand, don't stall, have faith
Though the road is long, there are golden gardens
At the sweet end of your trail

Though the road is long, there are golden gardens
At the sweet end of your trail
At the ѕweet end of your trаil
