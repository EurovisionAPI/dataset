Angel In Disguise

Woke up tonight, looked at the moon
Blinding light filled up my room
Looked to my right, my better half
And it's alright, if it's all I have
I let it ride, I'm satisfied
Just be mine

Kill me with killer kiss
Kill me with tempting lips
Stare me with candy eyes
Love me with luscious thighs
Kill me with killer kiss
Kill me with tempting lips
Stare me with candy eyes
Love me with luscious thighs
Angel in disguise

Not a day goes by, not without you
Crossing my mind, if you only knew
Keep hope alive, I have faith in you
Two worlds collide, honest and true
You're my lullaby, passion for life
My starlit night

Kill me with killer kiss
Kill me with tempting lips
Stare me with candy eyes
Love me with luscious thighs
Kill me with killer kiss
Kill me with tempting lips
Stare me with candy eyes
Love me with luscious thighs

It's simple, like you and I, just spread your wings and learn to fly
I must be one lucky guy with a girl like you right by my side
No sweat, am I doing this right? Bring the moon to the moonless sky
Yeah, I see – the stakes are high, but this story ends with no goodbye
Girl, I'm qualified, I get what I see, no need to try
I'll make sure your dreams will never die

Kill me with killer kiss
Kill me with tempting lips
Stare me with candy eyes
Love me with luscious thighs
Kill me with killer kiss
Kill me with tempting lips
Stare me with candy eyes
Love me with luscious thighs

I said spread your wings and fly, spread your wings and fly
Angel in disguise
Angel in disguise
Spread your wingѕ аnd fly
