Here I am

Here I am, here I am

Here I am – in your words, thoughts, every gesture
Here I am – like water, earth, fire and air
Here I am – in my arms you're melting like ice

You're waiting for at least a smile, a word
Every day you're trying to win me over again
I got used to you

And when I have some problem
You're the first to stand at my door
Now I'm finally sure
That it's you sending me flowers every day

I'm your inspiration, your remedy for tears
(Your world revolves around me)
You're my shadow at my command
(Appearing right beside me, jumping in the fire when I want you to)

I can feel anxiety taking over you, again and again
I'm uncovering you like a pack of cards, little by little
By your side, I lose my restraints

And when the night puts us to sleep
My thoughts rush towards your eyes, your lips
Just to make sure that still, after all…

I'm your inspiration, your remedy for tears
(Your world revolves around me)
You're my shadow at my command
(Appearing right beside me)

I'm your inspiration, your remedy for tears
(Your world revolves around me)
You're my shadow at my command
(Appearing right beside me, jumping in the fire when I want you to)

Here I am!

I'm your inspiration, your remedy for tears
(Your world revolves around me)
You're my shadow at my command
(Appearing right beside me)

I'm your inspiration, your remedy for tears
(Your world revolves around me)
You're my shadow at my command
(Appeаring right beside me)

Right beѕide me
