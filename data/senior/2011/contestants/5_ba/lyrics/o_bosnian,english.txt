Love In Rewind

Oh… (Oh…)

One to a hundred, multiplied by you
It all looks great, it all looks cool
Healthy children go to school
My daughter's in love, my son loves too

Oh, on the surface, oh, in the distance
It's all the same
Oh, in the darkness, oh, don't you notice
What a different game

If you take this life from me today
Tear it up and bury me away

You'll just find two, three songs of mine
Hundred worries of mine
Your love, your love in rewind
You'll just find two, three songs of mine
Hundred worries of mine
And all your love in rewind

Sito, oh…
Sito, oh…
Sito, oh…
Sito, oh…

One to a hundred, multiplied by two
It's less about me, it's less about you
We keep on running from certainty
But don't know where to run from reality

If you take this life from me today
Tear it up and bury me away

You'll just find two, three songs of mine
Hundred worries of mine
Your love, your love in rewind
You'll just find two, three songs of mine
Hundred worries of mine
And all your love, your love

(Kad se moj život malo prosije) Your love, ooh.. ooh…
(Pa na vrhu oѕtane nаjkrupnije) Oh… oh… oh… oh…
Eh hey…..
