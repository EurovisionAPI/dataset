Flyers

You and me, we flew so high
It was not a long time ago
An airplane full of young dreams
Was ready for us

The two of us, it was so great
We conquered the sky
Why did you let me go
Without a parachute in the night?

I've never totally forgotten the time
When we were flyers
You haven't left my heart
I only think about it

You've often told me: "We're strong, both of us"
Something like that couldn't pass away like this
I've never totally forgotten the time
When we were flyers

I would like to do it again with you
Such a flight into the evening glow
I would like to risk my heart once again
Even if it killed me

The two of us, it was so great
Something like this is rare
Will we once again
Lose ourselves in the clouds?

I've never totally forgotten the time
When we were flyers
You haven't left my heart
I only think about it

You've often told me: "We're strong, both of us"
Something like that couldn't pass away like this

I've never totally forgotten the time
When we were flyerѕ
You haven't left my heart
I only think аbout it
