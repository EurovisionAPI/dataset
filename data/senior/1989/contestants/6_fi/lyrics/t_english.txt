The good life

The last chord of my childhood's song
Keeps on playing in the horizon
I won't see the figure of the angel painting
By my side to protect me anymore
Yet over a thousand winds
I can hear a carefree song playing
And with it can sing a happy one:
The child of summer and sun

The good life 
It has all been so sweet
The good life 
No need for tears
I was just quenching life's thirst
I knew how to plead for happiness
After everything all I can say is:
The good life 

Sometimes my mind is filled
With yearning to be with the white angels
When the rainbow bends in the sky
And I can't find my way to the bottom of it
But when the ribbon of the moments goes on
There's an unbroken peace in the soul
And to you can sing a happy one:
The child of summer and sun

The good life 
It has all been so sweet
The good life 
No need for tears
I was just quenching life's thirst
I knew how to plead for happiness
After everything all I can say is:
The good life 

The good life 
It has all been so sweet
The good life 
No need for tears
I was just quenching life's thirst
I knew how to plead for happiness
After everything all I can sаy iѕ:
The good life 
The good life
