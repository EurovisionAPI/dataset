The closeness of friends

You seek out my thoughts, I know what you will say
But if you told me what you know, the silence would remain

When the closeness of friends has become a threat
And smiles of hope are erased
Then come and wake me up, let's dance
Then you'll remain mine, you are my friend

I know you are small, but still very big
You want to embrace the whole world, I greet you, brother

When the closeness of friends has become a threat
And smiles of hope are erased
Then come and wake me, let's dance
Then you'll remain mine, you are my friend

(Your voice has reached me, and I let you in)
For there is room for us both, for thoughts and minds

When the closeness of friends has become a threat
And smiles of hope are erased
Then come and wake me, let'ѕ dance
Then you'll remain mine, you аre my friend
