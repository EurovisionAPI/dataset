Through the wind

Through the wind, through the rain
Straight through… through everything

I see you in front of me, with my eyes closed
I can feel you, with my heart locked up
I hear you talking, but you aren't there
You aren't there

And I'd feel lost
If I have to lose you
And I keep dreaming of you
Because I can't miss you
I can't miss you

Through the wind, through the rain
Straight through everything
Through the storm
Even if it's not going my way
Because of you, I'm never alone

I feel you by my side
When I want to forget at night on the street
What's written in my eyes
If you only knew

And I want to get lost in a winner's extasy
And I'd like to scream
But I can only sing
I can only sing

Through the wind (through the wind)
Through the rain
Straight through everything
Through the storm (Through the storm)
Even if it's not going my way
Because of you, I'm never alone

Through an endless distance
Through a wall of emptiness
Through a land of silence
Through a wall of emptiness

Through the wind (Through the wind)
Through the rain
Straight through everything
Through the storm (Through the storm)
Even if it's not going my way
Because of you, I'm never alone

Never alone
Becauѕe of you, I'm never аlone
