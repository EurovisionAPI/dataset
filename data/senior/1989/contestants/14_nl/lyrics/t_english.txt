Stay the way you are

You just came rolling into my life
It was different from before
I knew you already quite some years
You really didn't like me, apparently

Stay the way that I know you now
I love you the way you are
Simply the way you are
Stay yourself, don't change
Simply be yourself, please
Simply the way you are

In all that time you've experienced a lot
In spite of everything, you remained faithful
You're my friend, my whole life
What would I be without you?

Stay the way that I know you now
I love you the way you are
Simply the way you are
Stay yourself, don't change
Simply be yourself, please
Simply the way you are

There's so much to learn from you
Come on, teach me, I love you
There's still so much I can learn from you
Come on, teach me, I love you

Stay the way that I know you now
I love you the way you are
Simply the way you are
Stay yourself, don't change
Simply be yourself, pleaѕe
Simply the way you аre
