Born to love

Be silent, kiss me
Make me believe that everything remains the same
Close your eyes, please
Give me one more night

Be silent, love me
Give me time until dawn
If I can't make you happy
Don't tell me now

Born to love
I'd like to join your way
And to walk to your destiny
To kiss your footprints
To love your sign
Born to love

I already know, it's already late
Thank you for this body-to-body
If I don't see you again, my love
Thank you for all your kisses

Born to love
I'd like to join your way
And to walk to your destiny
To kiss your footprints
To love your sign
Born to love

Born to love
I'm carrying spring in my skin
And full moon in my caresseѕ
And much more love than I wаnted
Born to love
