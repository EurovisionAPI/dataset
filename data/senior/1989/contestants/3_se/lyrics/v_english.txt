Some Day

Someday, we walk through the night
Someday, I'm holdin' you tight
Someday, no more on your own
I'll be by your side, we'll find our way home

Someday, I know we'll be there
Someday we'll reach everywhere
Someday I won't be alone
You're there by my side, we'll find our way home

We're walkin' in circles and try to hold on
Try to hold on to the past
We keep on searchin', but where do we go?
Looking for love that will last
Looking for love that will last

Oh… someday, we walk through the night
Someday, I'm holdin' you tight
Someday, no more on your own
I'll be by your side, we'll find our way home

Maybe I'm dreamin', could this be true?
Everything happened so fast
I kept on searchin', searchin' for you
Looking for love that will last
Oh… looking for love that will last

Oh… someday, we walk through the night
Someday, I'm holdin' you tight

Whoa… someday
I'll be by your side, we'll find our way home

Someday, I know we'll be there
Oh… someday we'll reach everywhere
Someday I won't be alone
You're there by my side, we'll find our way home

(Someday, we walk through the night,)
Someday, I'm holdin' you tight
Someday, no more on your own
I'll be by your ѕide, we'll find our wаy home
