What no one sees

Light up my path, lustful old moon
Though the road seems clear there are things the eye can't see
The world is full of people seeking happiness
That glows like gold in the light from the moon

Look back into my eyes
Look back, I wait for you
Look back into my eyes
And you can see what no one sees

Everyone desires something they keep to themselves
I intend if I may, to have a secret with you
Light up my path, oh, you lustful old moon
Though the road seems clear there are things the eye can't see

Look back into my eyes
Look back, I wait for you
Look back into my eyes
And you will see what no one sees

Look back into my eyes
Look back, I wait for you
Look back into my eyes
And you will see whаt no one seeѕ
