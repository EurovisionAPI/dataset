To live without you

If you and I had to live on this earth
The two of us and that nobody
Nobody would be without a human soul
Lonely and with bitter tears

That's why I wanted to say, I would die without you
It's with you, that life seems beautiful
That's why I wanted to say, I would die without you
It's with you, that life seems beautiful

I do not believe that I'd like to get old this way
Yes I'd prefer not to live in this world
People need each other
Even if they quarrel
If you're honest you'll agree with me

That's why I wanted to say, I would die without you
It's with you, that life seems beautiful
That's why I wanted to say, I would die without you
It's with you, that life seems beautiful
That's why I wanted to say, I would die without you
It's with you, that life seemѕ beаutiful
