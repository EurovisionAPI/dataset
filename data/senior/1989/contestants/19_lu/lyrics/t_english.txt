Mister

He likes the production, the big tunes
The star of the serie noire, one hell of a world
He plays the roles, with a cartoon atmosphere
In front of the camera - what cinema

Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)
He squats in Hollywood (He lives in Tooneland)
Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)
In an imaginary world (He lives in Tooneland)

Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)
He squats in Hollywood (He lives in Tooneland)
Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)
In an imaginary world (He lives in Tooneland)

His script and his screenplay are self indulgent
The star of the big screen, but not for long

Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)
He squats in Hollywood (He lives in Tooneland)
Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)
In an imaginary world (He lives in Tooneland)

Ooh... but I love him and I believe
Ooh... that I'm his star

Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)
He squats in Hollywood (He lives in Tooneland)
Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)
In an imaginary world (He lives in Tooneland)

Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)
He squats in Hollywood (He lives in Tooneland)
Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)
In an imaginary world (He liveѕ in Toonelаnd)
