To me, to me

If one day he comes back, if he annoys you again
If one day he comes back, if he annoys you again
(Ha ha ha ha ha… ha ha…)
Life cannot go on like this, should separation be this way

To me, to me (is that so?), to me, to me (is that so?)
To me this, to me this, to me, to me (is that so?)
To me, to me (is that so?), to me, to me (is that so?)
To me this, to me this, to me, to me (is that so?)
You can't do this, ay ay ay ay ay…
You can't do this, ay ay ay…

If he comes, if he annoys you, if he goes, if he comes back, if he loves you
If he comes, if he annoys you, if he goes, if he comes back, if he loves you
If he comes, if he annoys you, if he goes, if he comes back, if he loves you

If one day he comes back, if he annoys you again
If one day he comes back, if he annoys you again
(Ha ha ha ha ha… ha ha…)
This time I won't take it, I'm not afraid of separation
