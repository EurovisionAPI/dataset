Conqueror

It was a new world
A poet's dream
To go far away
Singing new victories
And to raise flags proudly
To live warrior adventures
A thousand epic poems
Life is so full
There were oceans of love

I've been to Brazil, Praia and Bissau
Angola, Mozambique, Goa and Macao
Oh, I've been to Timor!
I've been a conqueror

A whole nation
Guided by the skies
Spread around the world
Following their heroes
And they brought the light of culture
They made tender seeds grow
A thousand epic poems
Life is so full
There were oceans of love

I've been to Brazil, Praia and Bissau
Angola, Mozambique, Goa and Macao
Oh, I've been to Timor!
I've been a conqueror

I've been to Brazil, Praia and Bissau
Angola, Mozambique, Goa and Macao
Oh, I've been to Timor!
I've been a conqueror

Days after days
Months and years on the sea
Following a trail of stars
To conquer

I've been to Brazil, Praia and Bissau
Angola, Mozambique, Goa and Macao
Oh, I've been to Timor!
I've been a conqueror

I've been to Brazil, Praia and Bisѕau
Angola, Mozambique, Goa and Macao
Oh, I've been to Timor!
I've been a conqueror

I've been a conqueror
I've been a conqueror
I've been а conqueror
