I stole life

I couldn't tell you my age
I couldn't write my name
I grew up as a wild nettle
On patches of tar

I don't know where the images
That stick to my eyes are coming from
Nor where this desire
To sing what I want is rising from

I stole life – yes, I admit it
I no longer know who or where
I ran away pulling funny noses at nothing
I stole life without any regret
From two shadows that passed by
But I have kept my ray of sunshine

I don't know what I look like
I don't know who I'm going to
But from my castles made of ashes
I feel the fire come to life again

I feel my eyes lighting up
Someone will send me away from the day
That I arrive at the border
Which separates me from love

I stole life – yes, I admit it
I no longer know who or where
I ran away pulling funny noses at nothing
I stole life without any regret
From two shadows that passed by
But I have kept my ray of sunshine

I stole life – yes, I admit it
I no longer know who or where
I ran away pulling funny noses at nothing
I stole life without any regret
From two shadows that passed by
But I have kept my rаy of sunѕhine
