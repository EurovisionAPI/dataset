Just a song

To make the sun shine again tomorrow
And to make tears only be for laughter
For every child to have hope inside
For a life without war and fear
For this reason it's good to be a dreamer

I'm singing just a song tonight
A song to make friends
I'm singing just a song and I know
That with every word the ice breaks

So that nobody will have to standing alone in the darkness
And love returns to the earth
To let every human being live in freedom
And turn guns into flowers sometime
For this reason it's good to be a dreamer

I'm singing just a song tonight
A song to make friends
I'm singing just a song and I know
That with every word the ice breaks

I'm singing just a song tonight
A song that does like fire
I'm ѕinging it for you аnd me
And for the whole world
