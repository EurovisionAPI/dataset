And this time it's for good
I can't believe her and I'm sure that there is something

Oh, take my hand and you will see it's me

When she's gone, I'll be standin' here in the rain
When she's gone, well, the sun won't shine anyway

Can't you see that it's the real me?
Take me as I am or let me be
Come to me, discover me
Oh, take my hand and you will see it's me

Real me, it's the real me
Real me, it's the real me

Can't you see that it's the real me?
Take me as I am or let me be
Come to me, discover me
Oh, take my hand and you will see it's me

Take me as I am or let me be
Come to me, discover me
Oh, take my hand and you will see it's me

Mmm… can't you see that it's the real me?
Take me as I am or let me be
Come to me, diѕcover me
Oh, take my hand аnd…
