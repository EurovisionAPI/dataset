Let's meet tonight

Me and you together, without any second thoughts
Let's fly far away
And turn this night into a celebration

Let's meet tonight
And go to strange distant world
Let's enjoy tonight
The time that passes, and never comes back

Let's meet tonight
And go to strange distant world
Let's enjoy tonight
The time that passes, and never comes back

Me and you together, before the sun rises
Let's live the night
And leave the problems for tomorrow morning

Let's meet tonight
And go to strange distant world
Let's enjoy tonight
The time that passes, and never comes back

Our life passes so quickly
Let's enjoy it together before it's too late

Let's meet tonight
And go to strange distant world
Let's enjoy tonight
The time that passes, and never comes back

Let's meet tonight
And go to strange distant world
Let's enjoy tonight
The time that passes, and never comeѕ bаck
