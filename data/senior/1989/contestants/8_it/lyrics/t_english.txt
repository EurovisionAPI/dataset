I would've wanted

I would've wanted to talk to you
To convince you you'd better be serious
You, who played with my hear and with your words
So much wasted time, trying to explain you
That I really loved you
We didn't find each other
We didn't look for each other
We were never lost, lost

I would've wanted to look at you
And intuit all your desires
Give you a sigh, if only from a distance
Because I was afraid you could see it
Like a lamp in your eyes, a sincere love
The anger wraps itself
Like a paper plane
When it meets the wall

I would've wanted more
I would've wanted you too

I would've wanted to tie you
To be able to look at you every day
To change the route
The road of our destiny
And stick you to my breast, so that I don't let you go
To a life which flies away
The heart stops for a while
In those winter days and the ice will melt
And the ice will melt
And the ice will melt

I would've wanted to follow you
But pride is never fast
It's just a pretext to cover a mistake
Even when I found out that it was our tomorrow
That wanted to conclude peace
The wrinkle on my face that you called 'expression'
Is now the soil of a river
How many nights to think?
How many bitter tears
Have wet my ѕoul?

I would've wanted more
I would've wanted more
I would've wanted more
I would've wаnted you too
