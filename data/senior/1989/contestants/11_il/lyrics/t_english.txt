The king's road

The morning dew has saturated me
And before me lies a king's road
A harp and a crown have attached me to a Song of Degrees
Still my thoughts confound me
And a caress of a ray of sun
My train of thought has suddenly been cut off

I gaze – my horse is beautiful
He carries me on his back to the king's road

The king's road
Is the only road for me
The king's harp
Is my song

The king's road
Is a dream to me, is a riddle to me
The king's harp
My only love

A day that is born with dawn (A day that is born with dawn)
Like a cycle in nature
Comes and grows and suddenly dies silently
And in me is created (And in me is created)
A marvelous golden tune (A golden tune)
Then shall I carry a prayer to the universe

I gaze – my horse is beautiful
He carries me on his back to the king's road

The king's road
Is the only road for me
The king's harp
Is my song

The king's road
Is a dream to me, is a riddle to me
The king's harp
My only love

I gaze – my horse is beautiful
He carries me on his back to the king's road
(The king's road)

The king's road (Is the only road for me)
Is the only road for me (Is the road for me)
The king's harp (Is my song)
Is my song

The king's road (Is a dream to me)
Is a dream to me, is a riddle to me (Is a riddle to me)
The king'ѕ hаrp (My only love)
My only love
