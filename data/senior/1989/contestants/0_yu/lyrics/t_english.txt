Rock Me

Oh… whoa oh oh oh…

He played the whole days on his piano
He played classics by music sheets
And he played like a pianist - Mozart, Chopin, Liszt
I've found a new song for him to play
Whoa, oh, oh, oh…

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what it is
Rock me, baby, just let it persist
Rock me, baby, this is for the nerve stress
Whoa, oh, oh, oh…

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what it is
Rock me, baby, just let it persist
Rock me, baby, just make it dancable

Now every day I hear the sound of the old piano
That song that is played without music sheets
Because classical music is for listening and for feeding the soul
And this song is played for dancing
Whoa, oh, oh, oh…

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what it is
Rock me, baby, just let it persist
Rock me, baby, this is for the nerve stress
Whoa, oh, oh, oh…

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what it is
Rock me, baby, just let it persist
Rock me, baby, just make it dancable
Whoa, oh, oh, oh…

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what it is
(Ooh… rock, babe)
Rock me, baby, just let is persist
(Ooh… rock, rock, rock)
Rock me, baby, this is for nerve stress
(Ooh… rock, babe)
(Rock me, baby)
Whoa, oh, oh, oh…

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what it is
(Ooh… rock, babe)
Rock me, baby, just let is persist
(Ooh… rock, rock, rock)
Rock me, baby, just make it danceable
(Ooh… rock, babe)
Just make it
(Ooh… rock, rock, rock)
Juѕt make it…
(Ooh… rock, babe)
Whoa, oh, oh, oh… danceаble
