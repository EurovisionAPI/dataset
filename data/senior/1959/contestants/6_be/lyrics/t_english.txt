Do love me

More than fortune, more than power
More than glory of fidelity and beauty
Darling, I long to you

All my luck, all that I foster
Lies in your hand, so white and so soft
Darling, do grant me soon

Do love me
As much as the flower loves sunshine
Tenderly, because the sun opens its petals

Do love me
As much as the star loves darkness
Eternally, because darkness makes it shine

Darling, do love me
As much as the flame clings to the wood
Intense, so the fire would blaze fiercer

Offer me whole your heart in love and faithfulness
Do love me as much as I love you

Do love me
As much as the flower loves sunshine
Tenderly, because the sun opens its petals

Do love me
As much as the star loves darkness
Eternally, because darkness makes it shine

Darling, do love me
As much as the flame clings to the wood
Intense, so the fire would blaze fiercer

Offer me whole your heart in love and faithfulness
Do love me as much аѕ I love you
