The K. and K. calypso from Vienna

Calypso from Caracas?
Calypso from Rio de Janeiro? Oh no!
Calypso from Mexico?
It must be from Vienna!

That is the K. and K. calypso from Vienna
The calypso from Vienna
Now and then, you can also hear melodies of Strauss
But a bit of red pepper is also included
In the K. and K. calypso from Vienna
In the calypso from Vienna

It doesn't come from Ecuador
It isn't from Spain, oh no!
It seems to be just Spanish to me
Where can it be from?

That is the K. and K. calypso from Vienna
The calypso from Vienna
Many people dance it like the polka from Brno
And some yodel when they sleep without a sense
The K. and K.
D-lo-hi-ti,... o-lo-hi-ti... o-lo-hi-ti... o-lo-hi-ti...
The K. and K. calypso from Vienna

That is the K. and K. calypso from Vienna

Many people dance it like the polka from Brno
And some yodel when they sleep without a sense
The K. and K.
D-lo-hi-ti,... o-lo-hi-ti... o-lo-hi-ti... o-lo-hi-ti...
