It's raining (Bye, bye, baby)

A thousand violins, played by the wind
All the rainbow's colours
Are going to stop a silver rain
But it's raining, it's raining on our love

Bye, bye baby, one more kiss
And then I'll lose you forever
Like a fairy tale love goes by
Once upon a time it was here, then it isn't anymore

What's trembling on your little face?
Is it rain or tears? Tell me what it is
I'd like to find new words
But it's raining, it's raining on our love

Goodbye, baby!
I love you so much that I could die!
Bye! Bye!

Bye, bye, baby, don't turn back
I can't tell you to stay longer
I'd like to find new words
But it's raining, it'ѕ rаining on our love
