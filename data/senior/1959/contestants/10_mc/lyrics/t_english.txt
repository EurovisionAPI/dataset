My friend Pierrot

My poor Pierrot, you make your bow
And your face is sad like your life of an artist
You're not loved anymore, your love songs
Are too innocent, leave your velvet clothes behind

The public, with a cheer, decided your fate
Must drag the curtain over your life
The comedy has finished, your theatre is dead
And your song ran away in the night

My poor Pierrot, my friend Pierrot
About so much bad luck in the moonlight
My friend Pierrot, a man of few words
I really loved your writing, even when it was nothing but a sigh

If times have changed, old-fashioned harlequin
I'm forever your friend
As you have enchanted my most lovely years
That's why I tell you today

My friend Pierrot who makes his bow
Who quits the scene
Come and sing about your loveѕ аnd your grief
With me
