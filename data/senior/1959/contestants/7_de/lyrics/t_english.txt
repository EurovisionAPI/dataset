Tonight we want to go dancing

Hello, boy, tonight we want to go dancing
Hello, boy, tonight we want to move to the rhythm
Have you got some time? Then come along, don't say no
Today we want to be happy

Hello, boy, tonight the band is really good
Hello, boy, and we've got music in our blood
Have you got some time? Then come along, don't say no
The world is wonderful with the two of us

And that's why we want to dance, dance
Without any break till tomorrow morning
Always dancing, dancing to this melody

Hello, boy, we'll leave all our worries at home
Hello, boy, and we'll have a really good dance
Have you got some time? Then come along, don't say no
Today we want to be happy

What the teenager goes mad for
And what all twenties like
Yes, what everyone always likes to hear
Is music from all over the world

And that's why we want to dance, dance
Without any break till tomorrow morning
Always dancing, dancing to this melody

Hello, boy, we'll leave all our worries at home
Hello, boy, and we'll have a really good dance
Have you got some time? Then come along, don't ѕay no
Today we both want to be hаppy
