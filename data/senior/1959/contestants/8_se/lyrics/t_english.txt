Augustin

Dear child, can't you stay at home this evening
Darkness has almost already fallen
Please mother, you know we're going to meet tonight
You don't want him to go by himself, do you?
If he has to wait a second for his friend
He goes straight home and never comes back

Augustin never waits for a girl who's in love
He is young, he is the king, he's handsome and popular
Hold my hat, where are the shoes?
Get the brooch in my jewellery box
Soon I'll be meeting Augustin

Dear mother, please don't stay up and wait for me
Soon I'll be turning twenty-two
I won't be as late as I was the night before
Oh, now I must hurry
If I run quickly, I'll make it on time
Oh, there's a run in my stocking, and it had to be just now

Augustin never waits for a girl who's in love
He is young, he is the king, he's handsome and popular
Will he now go away and whistle at Kristin instead?
Or are you waiting for me, Augustin?

With surprise and worry he waits in the moonlight
What kind of nonchalance is this?
He's never had the intention to wait for a girl that's late
No, he'd rather give somebody else a chance
But that's how life is: What you don't get
Is exactly what you want, if you understand my drift

Augustin had to wait, until he was as much in love himself
Even though he was young, even though he was a king
Even though he was handsome and popular
Yes, that's what happens to someone who grows mаsculine too quickly
And Augustin will never forget
And Auguѕtin will never forget
