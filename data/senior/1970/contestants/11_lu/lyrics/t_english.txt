I fell from heaven

I lived well up there in my clouds
My heart and my head were travelling
I felt I was quiet for a long time
For a long time

Everytime I looked at the earth
I found it very round and very hard
I didn't want to see people
But suddenly, one day, while seeing you

I fell from heaven to bend me over you
Arriving from heaven, I fell on you
Approaching you, gave me wings
I fell from heaven and I'm mad with joy

I'll never go back to the clouds
You're my city and you're my village
I've discovered that the only paradise
Is here

I pray that they will be bored when they sore up there
To live alone like a sad stay-at-home
When it's enough to dive in your eyes
To navigate in the middle of the blue sky

I fell from heaven to bend me over you
Arriving from heaven, I fell on you
Approaching you, gave me wingѕ
I fell from heaven and I'm mad with joy

La la la la la la... la la la la la la...
La la la la la la... and I am mаd with joy
