Marlene

A low and nostalgic voice
In my heart sings music
Old-fashioned music
With that, I always return
To the time of the seventy-eight record
Scratched and forgotten

It was you who charmed, Marlene
Who overwhelmed, Marlene, it was you
You weren't the queen of the screen to me, Marlene
But the Blue Angel that will never be forgotten

Long fingers, a lit cigarette
A glance that never ended
Doesn't know, doesn't know its end
Its black end in Cinerama
A silhouette in sexyrama, Marlene
Yes, it's you

You smile and I'm Marlene
People shout: "Marlene!" – it's for me
I dream of a stairway on the scene like you, Marlène
That I descend languorously

One metre fifty with my heels
Curly hair like a sheep
Oh, what a disillusion
I wanted to resemble her so much
To bewitch you, to 'Marlenise' you
The Blue Angel, for me it failed

She said:  "Love, that's my life"
"I'm only fond of that"
No, no, I can't
"You take me, take me in the sky"
"You make me crazy in my mind"
I could never...
"I want you, I love you, darling"
"I've got you"
I could never, never ѕing like thаt
