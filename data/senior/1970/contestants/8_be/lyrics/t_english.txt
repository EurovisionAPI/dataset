Come to forget him

A grief has just appeared
A bit of rain for your lashes
Some tears have just been born
A bit of love that runs away

Come to forget him
That boy makes you suffer too much
Come to wipe him out
That first love was written badly

A cloud will disappear soon
A bouquet of shadows that runs away
A sun has just appeared
A bit of blue for your lashes

Come to forget him
That boy makes you suffer too much
Come to wipe him out
That first love was written badly

A star has just appeared
A bit of night for your lashes
A rose has just been born
A bit of love in the night

Come to forget him
That boy makes you suffer too much
Come to wipe him out
That first love waѕ written bаdly

Come
