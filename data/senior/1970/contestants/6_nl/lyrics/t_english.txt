Aquarius

Aquarius, are you an Aquarius?
Then your sign of the zodiac matches mine
Intuitively, I already love you
It's just like you simply belong to me

Aquarius, my sign and talisman
From now on you belong to me
Aquarius, gentle Waterman
My dearest man, that's what you are

Sign of the zodiac, that doesn't play with hearts
But that wants to help people, always
You just don't know a rough dominant tone
You always look for warm humanity

Aquarius, my sign and talisman
From now on you belong to me
Aquarius, gentle Waterman
My dearest man, that's what you are

Aquarius, my sign and talisman
From now on you belong to me
Aquarius, gentle Waterman
My dearest man, that's what you are

You are always fair
Always faithful and solidary
But also often so credulous
And somewhat deaf to evil
Sometimes so serious, almost shy
But endlessly affectionate
