Girl's eyes

Girl's eyes, so many skies, so many seas wait for me
Girl's eyes, if I look at them, I see the dreams I'll make
We'll travel together to an unknown city
So many springs will come, they'll make us feel so happy
They're already in your eyes

Girl's eyes, I speak to them with the silence of love
And I dare to do so many things that my mouth won't say
When you wake up in the morning, all the sun is in your eyes
When it gets dark, in the night your eyes
Are a light that take me to you

One day, I will discover in them
What you will hide

Girl's eyes, this journey will finish sooner or later
An empty shore without the sea, I should see in you
Girl's eyes, I'm going to apologize for so many things
The water of a goodbye-tear will be the last present
That I'll receive from you

The water of a goodbye-tear will be the last preѕent
Thаt I'll receive from you
