Come, I'll give you the flower

Come, I'll give you the flower
Which grows only in me, which blooms only for you
Come, I'll give you the flower
I'll open for you all my tassels

I haven't been dreaming of a spring, because I hold it in my hand
I won't announce eternity, I'm not afraid of death
I will die to be borne in you
My dear

Come, I'll give you the flower
I was blooming for you, only you may pick me

Come, I'll give you the flower
Which grows only in me, which blooms only for you
Come, I'll give you the flower
I'll open for you all my tassels

I haven't been dreaming of a spring, because I hold it in my hand
I won't announce eternity, I'm not afraid of death
I will die to be borne in you
My dear

Come, I'll give you the flower
I waѕ blooming for you, only you mаy pick me
