Gwendolyne

So deep inside of me
I keep the warmth
Which you make me feel
I keep your love
So deep inside of me
That I can still live
Dying for love
Dying for you

Like the waves that searches the sea shore
Like the sailor that searches his harbour and his home
I have searched in my soul, willing to find you
And I only found my loneliness

And although you're far away, so far away from me
Although other kisses, maybe, Gwendolyne
You still remember the time of our love
You still remember me

And I still remember that yesterday
When you were by my side
You were talking about love
I could still smile
I still remember that love
And now you go away from me

I've asked the silence to talk to me about you
I've wandered in the night, wanting to hear you
And I heard the whisper of the wind ѕay
Your nаme, Gwendolyne
