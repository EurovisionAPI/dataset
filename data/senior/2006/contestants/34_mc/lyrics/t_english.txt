The coco dance

Underneath the caress of the sun
Between heaven and sea, forget your ordeals
And if life leads you by boat
Let yourself go and come dancing

If your love is in thousand pieces
And your heart empty, your luck below zero
I have what you need to take care of yourself
That's to have a good stretch

Move, move your hands, your body and your back
Let me sway until the end of the summer
Move, move your hands, your body and your back
To the music that makes us fall in love

Hey oh, coco dance, it's the music of love
Hey oh, coco dance, it's the dance of love

(Ah…)
Tahiti on the Windward Islands
The golden sand on my tanned skin
We're indeed closer to paradise
To go dance the tāmūrē

Move, move your hands, your body and your back
Let me sway until the end of the summer
Move, move your hands, your body and your back
To the music that makes us fall in love

Hey oh, coco dance, it's the music of love
Hey oh, coco dance, it's the dance of love

The dance of love
Hey oh (Join us in our dance)
Hey oh, coco dance
(Join us in our dance)
Hey oh, coco dance
(Join us in our dance)

Hey oh, coco dance, it's the music of love
Hey oh, coco dance, it'ѕ the dance of love
