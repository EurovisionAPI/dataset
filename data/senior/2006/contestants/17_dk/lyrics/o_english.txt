Twist Of Love

Once upon a time there was this guy called Johnny
He was kinda shy and so in love with Connie
But so was O'Smarty, who played it cool
The king of the party, but oh… what a fool
(What a fool)

He didn't know how to twist
He didn't know how to make a girl insist
He didn't know how to move, he didn't feel the groove
He didn't know how to twist

Twist, he didn't know how to twist
He didn't know how to move, he didn't feel the groove
He didn't know how to twist

Once upon a night there was this guy called Johnny
He was kinda high and dancing with his honey
The queen of the party proclaimed him king
While poor ol' O'Smarty was left in the ring

He didn't know how to twist
He didn't know how to make a girl insist
He didn't know how to move, he didn't feel the groove
He didn't know how to twist

Twist, he didn't know how to twist
He didn't know how to move, he didn't feel the groove
He didn't know how to twist
Hit it, Johnny

A twist of love, a twist of pain
A twist of me and you
A twist of things you can't explain
Will make your dream come true

Be sure you know how to twist
Be sure you know how to make a girl insist
Be sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove
Be sure you know how to twist

Oh… (Twist)
Yeаh, twist
Be sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove
Be sure you know how to twist

Be sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove
Be sure you know how to twiѕt
