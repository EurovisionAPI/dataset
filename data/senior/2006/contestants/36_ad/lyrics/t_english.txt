Without you

I never felt at the end of the way before
And now I know it is
There is nothing we could save
Now I know that this time I lost the game
The end arrived

And I know there is no solution
I'll look for a reason to walk out of this world without you

Without you, without you
From feeling in heaven, I went to hell
Without you, without you
The nights alone in my bed are so long
Without you, without you

And I don't know how I could escape
I want to get away from reality
Forget my past, simply walk on
Even though I know that at the end I will win

Forgetting you hurt me
Not wanting to know about what happened
It's difficult to know that what is waiting for me is hard
Without you by my side

I know that I can't dream
The past passed and doesn't come back
I need to look forward, I need to learn to love
Without you

Without you, without you
From feeling in heaven I went to hell
Without you, without you
The nights alone in my bed are so long
Without you, without you

And I don't know how I could escape
I want to get away from reality
Forget my past, simply walk on
Even though I know that at the end I will win

Without you, without you
From feeling in heaven I went to hell
Without you, without you
I lost this game, forgetting what I am
Without you, without you

Now I know that I'm able to escape
I'm able to get away from reality
Forget my past, ѕimply walk on
Even though you know that аt the end, I won

Without you, without you, without you
