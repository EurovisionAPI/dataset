Loca

Mmm... every night I need mi loca
Every night I need her boca
Every night I need mi loco
Need him crazy just un poco

Hey, loca, give me, give me your boca (Yeah)
You're my girl, you're my loca (Can you feel this?)
You are breaking my heart
Whoa...

Hey, loco, please espera un poco
And I'll give you my choco
Do you want it or not?

Every time I see mi loca
I feel I go crazy un poco (Yeah)
She's so sexy, she's so hot
Every night she's breaking my heart

Every time I see mi loco
I realise he's crazy un poco (That's right)
And we keep on dancing all night long
With my boy, I will never feel alone

Hey, loca, give me, give me your boca
You're my girl, you're my loca (Yeah)
You are breaking my heart (Can you feel this?)
Whoa... (Can you feel this?)

Hey, loco, please espera un poco
And I'll give you my choco
Do you want it or not?
(Once again now)

If I wanna taste her love tonight
Need to kiss her boca one more time
I can fly away and reach the stars
Every time I drown into her eyes

If I wanna taste his love tonight
I just have to hold mi loco tight
I can fly always and reach the stars
Every time he looks into my eyes

Hey, loca, give me, give me your boca
You're my girl, you're my loca
You are breaking my heart (Can you feel this?)
Whoa... (Can you feel this?)

Hey, loco (Come on)
Please espera un poco (Yeah)
And I'll give you my choco (Just a little bit)
Do you want it or not?
Yeah, all right, mi Loco

She's a little bit loco, a little bit cocoa
A little bit tall, yo, a little bit small, yo
A little Latino, a little Europio
A little bit choco, exotic Morocco

She's a good girl, she's a little mean
Nice body from the covers of a magazine
Eyes like deep green, lips like Angeline
The most beautiful girl that you ever seen

Hey, loca, give me, give me your boca (Yeah)
You're my girl, you're my loca (Can you feel this?)
You are breaking my heart (Come on)
Whoa...

Hey, loco, please espera un poco (Come on)
And I'll give you my choco
Do you want it or not?
(Yeah, Connect-R, right on)

Yeah, come on, yeah
Love is love
Two thousand and six, yeah
Connect-R, Arsenium
For the next millennium, word
Love is love, baby
Can you hear me?
Can you feel thiѕ?
