Superstar

If the moon doesn't rise quickly, let it be
Let the night be a long darkness, if it will be, let it be
Your eyes are glittering, don't bother
Are you ready for love?

Let your emotions be with you
Close your eyes, be silent, let your heart beat
Let my light clear up the night
Are your ready for love?

Superstar in front of you – love me
Superstar in front of you – feel me
Superstar in front of you – live me
I'm the desire, I'm the desire, I'm the desire for you

Superstar in front of you – love me
Superstar in front of you – feel me
Superstar in front of you – live me
I'm the desire, I'm the desire, I'm the desire for you

The moon won't rise quickly, let it be
Let the night be a long darkness, let it be
Your eyes will glitter, don't bother
Are you ready for love?
Let it go, let  your emotions flow
Close your eyes, let your heart beat
Let my light clear it up

If the moon doesn't rise quickly, let it be
Let the night be a long darkness, if it will be, let it be
Your eyes are glittering, don't bother
Are you ready for love?

I am your superstar – you feel me, baby 
I'm your shining star – you reach me, baby 
I know what you are – just show me, baby 
Are you ready? Are you ready? 
Are you ready for love?
