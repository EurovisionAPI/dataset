Follow My Heart

Open up your heart to me 
I follow my heart 
I follow my heart 
I follow my heart 

Wait – I need to talk to you 
It burns me – girl, you know it's true 
Candle – you're the one for me 
Your love made me a believer 
I would like – another night of love 
Entirely – I wanna have it all 
Candle – so come on, get your love 
Come, take my gasoline 

Please, let me at least touch your hands
In them, I'll put a request to meet our eyesights
In your eyes, I'll stick the passion and desire
I'll get to your heart, do you want it?

I follow my heart and one day I'll confide 
The way that I feel about you by my side 
Let me be with you now, I know it's alright 
To follow my heart, 'cause our love is the light 

I follow my heart 
I follow my heart 
I follow my heart 

Wait – I need to talk to you 
It burns me – girl, you know it's true 
Candle – you're the one for me 
Your love made me a believer 
I would like – another night of love 
Entirely – I wanna have it all 
Candle – so come on, get your love 
Come, take my gasoline 

It's so easy to see the truth 
To understand the other entirely without words 
A loving heart can forgive everything 
But it never lets you alone 

Listen to your heart, believe it and come to me 
Inside beats are more important than any words 
And not keeping silence the heart will whisper, where your world is 
Open up your heart to me, feel it and fly up 

I follow my heart and one day I'll confide 
The way that I feel about you by my side 
Let me be with you now, I know it's alright 
To follow my heart, 'cause our love iѕ the light 

I follow my heart 
I follow my heart 
I follow my heart 
I follow my heart – open up your heаrt to me
