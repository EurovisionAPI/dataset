Congratulations

Hello, Europe
Okay, okay

Hey you, lookin' at me, I'm talkin' to you
I'm Silvia Night shinin' in the light, I know you want me too
Born in Reykjavík in a different league, no damn Eurotrash-freak
The vote is in, I'll freaking win
Too bad for all the others

So congratulations, I have arrived
I'm Silvia Night and I'm shining so bright
Eurovision nation, your dream's coming true
You've been waiting and waiting for me to save you
Wham bam boom

Oh my God…

My song – totally cool, no yesterday's news
It is hot okay, really not too gay
I'm coming here to stay
Want a piece of me, listen carefully
You'll be D.E.A.D
So boys and girls around the world
Let's meet next year in Iceland

So congratulations, I have arrived
I'm Silvia Night and I'm shining so bright
Eurovision nation, your dream's coming true
You've been waiting forever for me to save you

(So congratulations, so congratulations)
(So congratulations, so congratulations)
(So congratulations, so congratulations) Give it to me now
(So congratulations, so congratulations) Oh my God, oh…

(Ring, ring, ring) Hello, is it God?
(Ring, ring, ring) What's up, dog?
(Ring, ring, ring) It's me, Silvia Night, your favourite person in the world
(Ring, ring, ring) I'm saving the end of the world
See you, bye

(So congratulations) I have arrived
I'm Silvia Night and I'm shining so bright
Eurovision nation, your dream's coming true
You've been waiting forever for me to save you

Congratulations, I have arrived
I'm Silvia Night and I'm shining so bright
Eurovision nation, your dream's coming true
Just vote for your hero, that's what you muѕt do
I love you, my Europeаn children
