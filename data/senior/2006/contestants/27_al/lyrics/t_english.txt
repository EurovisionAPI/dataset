Fire and cold

I'm lost trying to forget
Do not burden my days
Everything is in vain, I don't understand
I tire of forgetting
With the time I kill my memories
In fire we're so cold

You've got to go, I kill myself
I see you and you blind me
We're in fire, and we search for cold
And in passion we are stopping ourselves
I'm frightened of my heart which loves you so

And I feel fire and cold, I can't do it anymore
My hope is lost in you
Darling, help me
I go away because I love you
Fire and cold, I tire in vain
I'm always there in your lips
I'm lost there, because my soul feels you

(Open, open, open, open your heart)
(Open, open, darling)
(Open, open, open, open, darling)
(Open, open, open, open, darling)

Everything in vain
My heart looks for a station, and in you it stops

Because all the thoughts, dreams, live only in you
I want to kiss you but I can't
Without you, my life I can't understand
I'm frightened of my heart which loves you so

And I feel fire and cold, I can't do it anymore
My hope is lost in you
Darling, help me
I go away because I love you
Fire and cold, I tire in vain
I'm always there in your lips
I'm lost there, because my soul feels you

And I feel fire and cold (Hoo ha… hoo ha…)
Darling (Hoo ha… hoo ha hoo…)
Fire and cold (I tire in vain, darling)
Hey… because my soul feels you

And I feel fire and cold, I can't do it anymore (Darling)
My hope is lost in you
Darling, help me
I go away because I love you
Fire and cold, I tire in vain (Darling)
I'm always there in your lips
I'm lost there, becаuse my soul feelѕ you
