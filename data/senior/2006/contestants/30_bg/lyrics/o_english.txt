Let Me Cry

(Honey, honey, honey, honey)
(Honey, honey, honey, honey)
(Please let me cry, just let me cry)

Told you I was aware
I have feelings to share with you
Something's over for good
(Honey, honey, honey, honey)
Love, passion, cheerful mood
(Honey, honey)
The truth

Let's say goodbye
And never back again, let me cry
I wanted you, you wanted to lie
I knew that it would happen this way, yeah

(Honey, honey, honey, honey)
(Honey, honey, honey, honey)
(Please let me cry, just let me cry) Oh…

Learning how to obey
(Honey, honey, honey, honey)
Lost my heart and my face
(Honey, honey)
My soul

Let's say goodbye
And never back again, let me cry
I wanted you, you wanted to lie
I knew that it would happen this way, yeah

Oh… oh… oh… yeah…

Let's say goodbye
And never back again, let me cry
I wanted you, you wanted to lie
I knew that it would happen this way

Let's ѕаy goodbye
