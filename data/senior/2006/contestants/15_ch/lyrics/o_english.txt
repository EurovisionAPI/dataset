If We All Give A Little

Everybody has a dream
What will come and what will be
And hopes it soon will be reality

But a dream is not enough
There's so much we gotta do
To overcome that bitter blue

'Cause we all know one hand alone
Can never move a rock of stone
It takes us all, me and you

If we all give a little
If we all give a little
We can make this world a home for everyone
If we all give a little
We can dry a million tears
And some hope will grow out of many fears

Everybody has some strength
They could spend on someone weak
Don't let life be a game of hide and seek

Everyone has things to give
To someone just to carry on
A little help to overcome

We all have learned a word alone
Will never touch a heart of stone
It takes much more, more of us

If we all give a little
If we all give a little
We can make this world a home for everyone
If we all give a little (If we all)
We can dry a million tears (Give a little)
And some hope will grow out of many fears

If we give a little love
Just believe it's really worth
Many million hearts are beating on this earth

If we all give a little
If we all give a little
We can make this world a home for everyone
(For everyone)
If we all give a little
We can dry a million tears

And some hope will grow (It will grow forever)
Out of many fears (If we stand together)
If we give a little, just a little
(If we give a little love)
Give a little love

If we all give a little
(Juѕt a little love)
All give а little
(A little) love
