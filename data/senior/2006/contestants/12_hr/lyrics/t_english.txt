My high heel

For the grass has not yet sprouted
Where my high heel has stepped

(Come here, come here, come here)
Hop, hop, hop, hop
(Go, my chick)

Tick-tock, around half past two
You'll pinch me, so that nobody can see it
I know them well, guys like you
The devils are your godfathers

Ring, ring, you'll search for my number
Knock, knock, go knocking somewhere else
(Darling, girl, come and tighten your socks)

For the grass has not yet sprouted
Where my high heel has stepped

Oyda da, oyda dai, oyda dai dai…
Oyda da, oyda dai, oyda dai dai…
Oyda da, oyda dai, oyda dai dai…
Oyda da, oyda dai… my, my high heel

(Six) seven, (six) eight, (six) nine
(Six) Mine
(Once again, girl)

S… s… s… sex
(Hop, hop, shake, shake)

Tick-tock, around half past two
You'll nibble me, so that nobody can see it
A golden ring, a thin moustache
Oh boy, I know them well, guys like you

Ring, ring, you'll search for my number
Shoo, shoo, go off to someone else
(Darling, girl, come and tighten your socks)

For the grass has not yet sprouted
Where my high heel has stepped

Oyda da, oyda dai, oyda dai dai…
Oyda da, oyda dai, oyda dai dai…
Oyda da, oyda dai, oyda dai dai…
Oyda da, oyda dai… my, my high heel

(Zoomba, zoomba, zoomba, zoomba)
(Hay, straw, cheese, salami)
(Risi bisi, a bigger pot)
(Red beet, red beet)
Africa, paprika

(Go, mine)
Six, six, six, seven, six, eight, six, nine
Six, six, six, six, mine, mine
Go, go

For the grass has not yet sprouted
Where my high heel has ѕtepped

Oyda da, oyda dai, oyda day dai…
Oyda da, oyda dai, oyda day dai…
Oyda da, oyda dai, oyda day dai…
Oyda da, oyda dаi… my, my high heel
