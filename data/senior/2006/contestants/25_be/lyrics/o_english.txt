Je t'adore

The sum of all my fantasies
That's everything you are to me

You came around and made my senses fly
Shook me up when you took me to the sky
Never thought that I could ever get this high

Je t'adore and I can't conceal it
Je t'adore, anyone can see it
You give me just a little more
Of everything I've waited for

Je t'adore, here's my heart, so take it
Je t'adore, only you can break it
You got me fallen to the floor
Any way you want, I'm yours
(Je t'adore)

Bye bye to all the lies I've heard
You made a different kind of girl

You spun me out and you made my senses fly
Shook me up when you took me to the sky
Never thought that I could ever get this high

Je t'adore and I can't conceal it
Je t'adore, anyone can see it
You give me just a little more
Of everything I've waited for

Je t'adore, here's my heart, so take it
Je t'adore, only you can break it
You got me fallen to the floor
Any way you want, I'm yours
Je t'adore

You're the rush that I missed
Made a wish that I'd feel a kiss
Just like this

Je t'adore, yeah, you made me feel it
Je t'adore, and I really mean it
You give me just a little more
Of everything I've waited for
(Everything I've ever waited for)

Je t'adore, here's my heart, so take it
Je t'adore, baby, don't you break it
You got me fallen to the floor
Any way you want, I'm yourѕ
