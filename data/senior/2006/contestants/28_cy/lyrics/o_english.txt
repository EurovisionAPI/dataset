Why Angels Cry

When I'm feeling down in this world of madness
You comfort all my sadness, you soothe away my pain
'Cause these are trying times, filled with so much sorrow
I wonder if tomorrow will bring a brighter day

Why do the angels cry?
Why doesn't love survive?
Why do we all just pretend?
Why do the angels cry?
Innocent children die
When will it all ever end?
Ever end?

Close your eyes and dream, and visualise a rainbow
Oh… a place where you can pray for peace and harmony

Search your heart and find a higher meaning
Let this be the start, a brand new beginning

Oh… talking 'bout peace and harmony
Oh…

(Why do the angels cry?)
Why do they cry?
(Why doesn't love survive?)
(Why do we all) just pretend?
Why do the angelѕ cry?
Innocent children die
When will it аll ever end?
Ever end?
