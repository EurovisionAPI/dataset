It was time

Become, as the only reason to resist
Hold out, raise your voice to exist
You can say it, you can sing it easily
But today my chorus is:

It was time for heaven to remember me at last
It was time, finally a rest, my own chance
It was time, it was time

Run after an ideal, it's worth it
Suffer, it hurts less when a dream is at the end
You can say it, you can sing it softly
But today my chorus is:

It was time for heaven to remember me at last
It was time, finally a rest, my own chance
It was time, it was time

I didn't believe it anymore
I didn't believe it anymore, actually it's still hard for me to believe it

It was time for heaven to remember me at last
It was time, finally a rest, my own chance

It was time, hopefully it will stay, and if it doesn't last
I'd be glad to tell the children
That I've touched it once in my lifetime

It wаѕ time
