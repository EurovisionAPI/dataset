Mr. Nobody

You, you came to me one night
Just like a ray of light
I thought we'd be forever

Now it's so clear to me
I'm part of history
You're leaving me in sorrow

So deeply, so badly, you're hurting me

Tell me, who's that lucky hero
Sleeping tightly on your pillow?
Ah… tell me, will it be forever?
'Cause when you look at me
I'm Mister Nobody
It's just a game you play
Can't let you walk away

Like a stranger passing by
With no more tears to dry
You're leaving me in sorrow

So deeply, so badly, you're hurting me

Tell me, who's that lucky hero
Sleeping tightly on your pillow?
Ah… tell me, will it be forever?
'Cause when you look at me
I'm Mister Nobody
It's just a game you play
Can't let you walk away

Tell me, who's that lucky hero
Sleeping tightly on your pillow?
Ah… tell me, will it be forever?
'Cause when you look at me
I'm Mister Nobody
It's juѕt a game you play
Can't let you walk awаy
