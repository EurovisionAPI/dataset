I Hear Your Heart

In a world that is beeping and blaring
Growing louder every day
I cover my ears
But none of the noise will go away (Away)

Sirens, barking dogs
Thank God for the one and only sound
That turns around and makes it right

I hear your heart whisper to me
No matter where I may happen to be, yeah
Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart
Can you hear mine too?

I hear your heart whisper to me
No matter where I may happen to be, yeah
Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart
Can you hear mine too?

Oh… as sensitive people we're trampled
Almost everywhere we go
There are days (when we will die) when we'll die
If one more stranger tells us no

So I hope your shadows melt away
As you say they've done before
Just like the one and only sound
That turns around for me once more

I hear your heart whisper to me
No matter where I may happen to be
Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart
Can you hear mine too?

I hear your heart (I hear your heart)
Whisper to me (Whisper to me)
No matter where I may (Where I may)
Happen to be (Happen to be)
Sending me love (Sending me love)
And shining it through (And shining it through)
I hear your heart
Can you hear mine too?

I hear your heart
Mine too
I hear your heart

A violin on a summer night
On a full moon mountaintop
Couldn't sound as sweet as you do
Don't stop, don't stop

I hear your heart (I hear your heart)
Whisper to me (Whisper to me)
No matter where I may (Where I may)
Happen to be (Happen to be)
Sending me love (Sending me love)
And shining it through (And shining it through)
I hear your heart (Your heart)
Can you hear mine too?

I hear your heart (I hear your heart)
Whisper to me (Whisper to me)
No matter where I may (Where I may)
Happen to be (Happen to be)
Sending me love (Sending me love)
And shining it through (And ѕhining it through)
I hear your heart
Can you heаr mine too?
