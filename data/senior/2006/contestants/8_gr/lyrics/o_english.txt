Everything

I can hear my heart breaking as I open the door
I can feel the tears on my face burn like fire
As I look in your eyes
And I know I'm still in love

With everything I hate, everything you do
Everything I fear, everything on you
Baby, baby, I'm still in love

With everything I hate, everything you do
Everything I fear, everything on you
Everything I hate, everything you do
Everything I fear, everything on you

I can feel my life ending as I whisper goodbye
And I know I'm still in love

With everything I hate, everything you do
Everything I fear, everything on you
With everything I hate, everything you do
Everything I fear, everything on you

I can't believe I still need you
I can't believe I still want you
Can't believe life means nothing without you
Baby, I'm still in love, still in love, ѕtill in love

With everything I hate, everything you do
Everything I fear, everything on you
Everything I hate, everything you do
Everything I fear, everything on you

I'm in love with everything you аre
