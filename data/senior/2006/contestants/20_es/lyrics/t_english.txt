One Bloody Mary

One Bloody Mary, please

I swear to Dior that I didn't want to, but he's stuck on me
Everything was clean and certain
I was the other woman, the fool, he's a bastard
A mediocre showoff

I made myself marvellous, I dumped him
Wicked martini boy
The unfortunate boy has a lot of fiery words
But this one's not going to deceive me

I may be from an underground slum
But my heart has declared to you
Duty free, duty free, duty free
One Bloody Mary, please

I spend the hours dancing
And he, desperate in the bar, drinking and drinking
His look at me is a killer, I have him worked up
He's dying inside himself and I'm crazy

I may be from an underground slum
But my heart has declared to you
Duty free, duty free, duty free
One Bloody Mary, please

There could have been a good tease
It looked pluperfect
But see, your time is over
The night starts again

The moon changed direction, and I saw myself staggering
Frantically looking for ambiance
And see, what's the point of this?
Again you and me, face to face

I may be from an underground slum
But my heart has declared to you
Duty free, duty free, duty free
One Bloody Mary, please

There could have been a good tease
It looked pluperfect
But see, your time is over
The night starts again

There could have been a good tease
It looked pluperfect
But see, your time is over
The night starts again

One Bloody Mary, pleаѕe
