Lejla

Down a field, a scent of wind
And pain follows me like a shadow
Are you sighing after me somewhere?
Where are you hidden from me?

Place rosemary in your hair
And a flower from an old fountain
Layla, could you love another?

If they propose to you tomorrow
Know that I won't be there
Sorrows are easily forgiven
But only love never is

Could you love another?

Dove, my dove
Bring her tears instead of a song
I'm leaving, as if guilty
For loving who I'm not allowed

Dove, my dove
Bring her tears instead of a song
I'm leaving, aѕ if guilty
For loving you who I'm not allowed

For loving you, Lejlа
(Dove, my dove)
