Coisas de nada (Gonna make you dance)

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style

Não digas nada, somos livres de ficar
Não estragues a noite com coisas de nada
Juntos, tão juntos, os dois pela noite
Podemos rir e falar e dançar outra vez

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style

Deixa as lágrimas, também tu podes rir
Está tudo aí, guardado dentro de ti
Dançar na noite, esquecer o tempo
E ouvir a música a chamar outra vez

(Oh…) Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style

Não digas nada, não digas nada
Não estragues a noite com coisas de nada

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style
(Gonna make you dance)

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while
(Baby, keep on dancin')
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style

We're gonna make you dance
