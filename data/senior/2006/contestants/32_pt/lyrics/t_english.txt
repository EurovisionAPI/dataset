Meaningless things (Gonna make you dance)

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile 
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while 
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style 

Don't say anything, we're free to stay
Don't ruin the night with meaningless things
Together, so close together, the two of us in the night
We can laugh and talk and dance again

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile 
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while 
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style 

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile 
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while 
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style 

Leave the tears, you can laugh too
It's all there, kept inside of you
Dancing in the night, forgetting the time
And listening to the music calling again

(Oh…) Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile 
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while 
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style 

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile 
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while 
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style 

Don't say anything, don't say anything
Don't ruin the night with meaningless things

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile 
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while 
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style 
(Gonna make you dance) 

Gonna make you dance, gonna make you smile 
I'll make you stop thinking sad things for a while 
(Baby, keep on dancin') 
And everything waits when you're dancin' in style 

We're gonna make you dance
