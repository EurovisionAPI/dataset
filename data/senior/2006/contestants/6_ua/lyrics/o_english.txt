Talk to my heart, whisper my name
Show me your love, I need you more than air
You'll be my part, that's why I came

I love the way you shine
Love when you cross the line
Just give me one more sign, show me your desire
Don't hide your love away, don't wait another day

Talk to my heart, whisper my name
Show me your love, I need you more than air
You'll be my part, that's why I came
