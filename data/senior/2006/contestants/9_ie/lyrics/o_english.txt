Every Song Is A Cry For Love

Every song is a cry for love
Every voice can rise above
So don't be afraid
Just show what you're made of
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love

Every day is a brand new start
Every night you could fall apart
Anytime you doubt the truth that's in your heart
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love

Being strong, being tough
Never tender, always rough
It was never enough for me

In the dead of the night
Only love can hold you tight
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love

Every kiss is a call for home
Every touch means you're not alone
You don't always have to make it on your own
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love

Being strong, being tough
Never tender, always rough
It was never enough for me

In the dead of the night
Only love can hold you tight
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love

Sing it out: every song is a cry for love
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love
Every song iѕ а cry for love
