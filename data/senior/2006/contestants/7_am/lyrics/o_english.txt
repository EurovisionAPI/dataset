Without Your Love

Drumming hearts and your silent words of love
They still remain in the shades of night
Will you go? Will you ever save my storming soul?
I need to know

Should I live, should I die without your love?
Should I smile, should I cry without your love?
Should I fall, should I fly without your love?
All I can is only living for you, breathing for you

What I lose, what I find without your love?
What I say, what I hide without your love?
What I have in my mind without your love?
Tell me what I have to do, since I love you

Fly with me, take my wings and dream away
The stars will lead to the heavens' way
One's for sure:
There's a thousand ways to say goodbye
What you'll decide?

Should I live, should I die without your love?
Should I smile, should I cry without your love?
Should I fall, should I fly without your love?
All I can is only living for you, breathing for you

What I lose, what I find without your love?
What I say, what I hide without your love?
What I have in my mind without your love?
Tell me what I have to do, since I love you

Should I live, should I die without your love?
Should I smile, should I cry without your love?
Should I fall, should I fly without your love?
All I can is only living for you, breathing for you

Should I live, should I die without your love?
Should I smile, should I cry without your love?
Should I fall, should I fly without your love?
All I can is only living for you, breathing for you

What I lose, what I find without your love?
What I say, what I hide without your love?
What I have in my mind without your love?
Tell me what I have to do, becаuѕe I love you
