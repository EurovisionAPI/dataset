Dance of the elves

(Haya… ha haya… haya…)
(Come with me into the summer night)

Only I can catch your glance
Show my claws in the kiss you got
Excite you, so you turn into fire
Come here, I know you want to

Haya… ha haya… haya…
Come with me into the summer night
Haya… ha hayaya… haya…
Nothing is hidden tonight

Only I know all that you are
Give you a spark, I see you are near
Float with me, let everything turn into fire
Come here, I know you want to

Haya… ha haya… haya…
Come with me into the summer night
Haya… ha hayaya… haya…
Nothing is hidden tonight

No one knows, the wind is playing
The moon looks away, and we are everything

Haya… ha haya… haya…
Come with me into the summer night
Haya… ha hayaya… hayа…
Nothing iѕ hidden tonight
