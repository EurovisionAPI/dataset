No, No, Never

My love is stronger now than you'll ever know
And it won't ever let you go
My love is wider than the ocean can be
And it's deeper than the deep blue sea

My love goes higher than a mountain can rise
And I see it there, in your eyes
My love gets tougher when the going gets rough
And believe me, I got more than enough

Keep tryin', babe, keep holdin' on
There's a place we belong
Where things are good, where love is strong

I'm never ever gonna leave you to cry on your own
Never ever gonna not go and pick up the phone
I'm never ever gonna let you be chilled to the bone
No, no, never
No, no, never

I'm never ever gonna leave when you're lost in the storm
Never ever gonna not keep you safe where it's warm
I never ever will desert you when your heart is torn
No, no, never
No, no, never

My love shines brighter than a twinklin' star
Baby, no matter where you are
And my love keeps burnin' like an eternal flame
You can feel it when I'm callin' your name

Keep tryin', babe, keep holdin' on
There's a place we belong
Where things are good, where love is strong

I'm never ever gonna leave you to cry on your own
Never ever gonna not go and pick up the phone
I'm never ever gonna let you be chilled to the bone
No, no, never
No, no, never

I'm never ever gonna leave when you're lost in the storm
Never ever gonna not keep you safe where it's warm
I never ever will desert you when your heart iѕ torn
No, no, never
No, no, never

Oh… never ever gonna leave you to cry on your own
Never ever gonna not go and pick up the phone
I'm never ever gonnа let you be chilled to the bone
No, no, never
No, no, never

No, no, never
No, no, never
