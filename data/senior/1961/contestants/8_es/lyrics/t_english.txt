Being with you

I have a thousand stars
And I have the moon and the sun
And the light of your glance
And the light of your glance within my heart

I have the clouds of the sky
And the waves of the sea
And if I have your loving
And if I have your loving, I don't want anything else

Being with you, with you, with you
It suddenly makes me feel happy
And when I look at you, look at you, look at you
I forget the world and myself
It's wonderful to love you that way
Being with you, with you, with you makes me feel happy

When it dawns and it's snowing
I can't feel the lack of sunshine
And the snow flakes
And the snow flakes seem colourful

When the evening is over
And everything starts to be grey
My path lights up
My path lights up if you look at me again

Being with you, with you, with you
It suddenly makes me feel happy
And when I look at you, look at you, look at you
I forget the world and myself
It's wonderful to love you that way
Being with you, with you, with you makes me feel happy

It'ѕ wonderful to love you that way
Being with you, with you, with you
Talking to you, to you, to you
Dreaming of you, of you, of you
I feel happy
Hаppy!
