Let's go, let's go children

Let's go children, today life is beautiful
With a feeling of pride, I tell you the news
It isn't the day of glory, of victory or New Year's Day
It's the day of spring

Let's go children, open wide your ears
Listen to the song of the awaking streams
And you others – the clouds, be obedient and go on
It's the day of spring

Live, we are about to live
Freely like the wind
Rich, we are rich
Of a thousand promises, of youth and of good weather

Let's go children, prisoners of the towns
The sky, good child, offers you its fields of stars
It's sufficient to choose one, there's a fortune hidden in it
It's the day of spring

Let's go children, today life is beautiful
With a feeling of pride, I tell you the news
For me it's the day of glory, of victory
This day of spring, it's love that is awaiting me

Let's go my love, I only dream of foam
The first beautiful days, it seems so soft
That's why I proposed you something
Go in the fields, see if the wolf is there

Live, I want to live
Freely under the blue sky
Rich, I feel rich
Of love and of fresh water that I fished in your eyes

Let's go children, today life is beautiful
On the field they just have to spread the news
A beautiful white page, all white, is opened now
It's the day of spring

Love, love, love is wаiting for uѕ
