We'll see each other once again

Everywhere in the world the departure is difficult
And sometimes the heart hurts
All words that you say
You don't believe them yourself anymore
Have a nice life, goodbye

Another smile – a kiss
Another wave – a greeting
And a ship goes out
And with it goes luck
Yet hope remains

We'll see each other once again
And maybe already next year
We'll see each other once again
Then everything will be as it used to be

So believe in our love
No matter what may happen
Somewhere, some day, always remember
We'll see each other again

And the Sunday was grey, and the sky was heavy
And the rain hammered on the roof
And as you walked along the street down to the sea
I was watching you from my window

So much love – gone
So many dreams – gone
I don't know where you are
But your last words still ring in my heart

Far, further than the end of the world 
My love is close to you 
And my straying heart 
Will never beat for anyone but you 

So believe in our love
No matter what may happen
Always remember: somewhere, some day
We'll see each other again

Always remember: somewhere, some day
We'll ѕee each other agаin
