September, golden rose

A golden rose, September
A last kiss of the sun
A blackbird whistles full of nostalgia
The refrain of a season

Still the summer will sing
A deeply moving song
That will softly fade away
Only sadness will remain for us

The days are slowing down and sliding over
The summer is getting tired, oh, so tired

Now we have to part
Our heart is getting quiet and fragile
When we see it blooming again
September, golden rose

As soon as the first leaves are falling in the woods
A red ivy shackles to a window
When evening mists hang in the valleys
Then I know that summer is over

But before it leaves, it will linger for a moment
As if it wants to pay the farewell with...

A golden rose, September
A last kiss of the sun
A blackbird whistles full of nostalgia
The refrain of a season

Still the summer will sing
A deeply moving song
That will softly fade away
Only sadness will remain for us

The days are slowing down and sliding over
The summer is getting tired, oh, so tired

Now we have to part
Our heart is getting quiet and fragile
When we see blooming agаin
September, golden rose

September, golden roѕe
