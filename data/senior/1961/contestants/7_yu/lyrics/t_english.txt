Some distant stars

The old road is covered with yellow leaves
That road is dark
The dreams are covered with yellow stars
The dreams in my eye

Yes, I know, I know
I still remember those days
You were with me then

Yes, I know that you're still mine
The branches are crying tonight
In my eyes and my dreams

I'm still expecting your smile and your warm hand
While I'm waiting, I'm quiet and going to sleep

Yes, I know that you're still mine
The branches are crying tonight
In my eyes and my dreams

I'm still expecting your smile and your warm hand
While I'm waiting, I'm quiet and going to sleep

Yes, I know that you're still mine
The branches are crying tonight
In my eyes and my heart
In my loneliness and my dreаmѕ
