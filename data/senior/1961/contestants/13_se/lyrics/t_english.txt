April, april

All the lively, happy birds are singing chirp, chirp, chirp
All the west winds happily play catch
All the anemones paint the meadows in white, white, white
All the girls are trying out their new hats
All the boys are happy that the woolen socks
Are changed to light nylon by the girls

April, it doesn't matter if the winter's been hard
April, when you can let your blonde hair down now

Spring is here again and I'm in love again
Spring, that's how it is
That's what I've been waiting for

April, infects me with the love bug
April, I can make you an April's Fool

Du du du du du du du du...
Du du du du du du du du...

Spring is here again and I'm in love again
Spring, that's how it is
That's what I've been waiting for

April, it doesn't matter if the winter's been hard
April, when you can let your blonde hair down now

April, infects me with the love bug
April, I can make you an April'ѕ Fool

Tra la la la la la la lа... mmm...
