Light in the window

The gown of the night has covered the land
Time has come to turn off the lights
Only the shadows stay seriously still and begin to dream

A small window is still lit
Who is awake, accompanied by her thoughts?
Longing for her friend she is singing and hoping:

A path of rays of light leads me into memories
The lantern burns forever, the memory never fades

Through the silent night all the way behind the stars
She sings a song for him, if he can hear it

A beautiful new star has lit up
The singer notices its shine as well
Now the loved one lit his window
He hears me while he is longing

The light is disguised by the rising dawn
The singer has fallen asleep
She flies to her friend on the wings of dreаmѕ
