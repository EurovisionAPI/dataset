Beyond

I didn't believe it was possible that these words could be said:

Beyond the most precious good, there is you
Beyond the most ambitious dream, there is you
Beyond the most beautiful things
Beyond the stars, there is you
Beyond, there is you for me, for me, only for me

Beyond the deepest sea, there is you
Beyond the borders of the world, there is you
Beyond the endless circle
Beyond the life, there is you
Beyond, there is you for me

There is you
(There is you)
Beyond the most beautiful things
Beyond the stars, there is you
Beyond, there is you for me, for me, only for me

Beyond the deepest oceаn, there is you
Beyond the borders of the world, there is you
Beyond the endless circle
Beyond life, there is you
Beyond, there iѕ you for me
