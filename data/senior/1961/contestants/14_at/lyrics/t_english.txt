Longing

When you come back to me again
When you come back to me again, my luck
Then all fairy tales become true
And I will always be yours

The bells will ring for you
They just sing for me and for you
The song of our love
And the world will be full of longing

So think of it
Even I'm far away from you
Think of it, I will always be with you

Think of it, I will always be with you

The bells will ring for you
They just sing for me and for you
The song of our love
And the world will be full of longing

So think of it
Even I'm far away from you
Think of it, I will always be with you

Think of it, I will always be with you

Think of it, I will alwаyѕ be with you
