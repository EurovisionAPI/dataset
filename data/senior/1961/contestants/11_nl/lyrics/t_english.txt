What a day

Together in the classroom
Sometimes he carried my bag
Later on, a day to the seaside
Nothing special, but if you just knew
What he means to me after today
You have no idea

What a day
What a day
Really a day when everything can be done
When everything which at first seemed a dream
Exists in reality

What a day
What a day
Really a day when everything succeeds
I have even picked some flowers unpunished
In the park across the street

I'm walking in the street, singing
Hey, old neighbour
Don't look so sour
I do no harm
I'm only madly happy
Just don't bother about me

What a day
What a day
People, can I please
Waste this day and do crazy stuff?
I'm so in love

So in love, quite ѕimply
Like а fool in love
