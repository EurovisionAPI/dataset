Summer in Palma

I became your friend and whispered "darling"
Your only answer was "yes, yes"
Waves beat against the shore, the sun is on fire
Summer at Palma beach

Say "my love" , be my love
Can you see the palms trembling, seabirds hovering
All in sweet harmony?

Say "my love" , be my love
Hear the guitars play our melody
The prayer of night: come to me, darling

I don't understand your language, it's like music
But I understand the looks you are sending
Let me once again hear its tone
Listen to the song of the south

Say "my love" , be my love
Can you see the palms trembling, seabirds hovering
All in sweet harmony?

Be my love , say "my love"
Hear the guitarѕ play our melody
The prayer of night: come to me, dаrling
