Dawn, don't rise

Stop, dawn, don't rise, you fiend
Let the night hide
These eyes which bear pearls
This heart which can't love another
The wine leads me to her
And further away from my senses

I have to drink
To get drunk
To live without her
Mother, I can't do it

Mother, go and ask her elders
Whether they will give her to me
If they do, call the musicians
If they don't, instead of curses
Cry for me

I have to drink
To get drunk
To live alone, without her
Mother, I can't do it

I have to drink
To get drunk
To live alone, without her
Mother, I can't do it

Dawn, don't riѕe
A drunken dance
Dаnce with me
