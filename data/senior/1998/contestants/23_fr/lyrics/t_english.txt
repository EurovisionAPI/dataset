Where to go

You don't have somewhere to go
You don't even know where to go
You don't have somewhere to go
You don't even know where to go

You don't have somewhere to go
When you're stuck, your eyes are closed
Nobody can decide the course of your life
Only you can draw it

You're not the first one
Hope will encourage you
If you think, you revive
If you weaken, you give up

You don't have somewhere to go
You don't even know where to go
You don't have somewhere to go
(You don't even know where to go)
No, no

In your manners, you're well up
But your heart speaks
You drool, you work hard, you feel bad

To see very clear
You could find the real road, the faith, the strength
Leading to the truth

You don't have somewhere to go
You don't even know where to go
You don't have somewhere to go
You don't even know where to go

No, you don't have, oh, somewhere to go
(You don't have somewhere to go)
(You don't even know where to go)
(You don't have somewhere to go)
Only you can change everything
(You don't even know where to go)
Oh no

(Not even somewhere to go, not even somewhere to go)
(Not even somewhere to go, not even somewhere to go)
Oh la...
(Not even somewhere to go, not even somewhere to go)
Oh lala...
(Not even somewhere to go, not even somewhere to go)
Oh la...

(You don't have somewhere to go)
No, you don't have
(You don't even know where to go)
Oh... somewhere to go
(You don't have somewhere to go)
Oh... where to go
(You don't even know where to go)
Oh no

(You don't have somewhere to go)
(You don't even know where to go)
Oh la... where to go
(You don't have somewhere to go)
Oh... where to go
(You don't even know where to go)
Oh la...

(You don't have somewhere to go)
(You don't even know where to go)
La la...
(You don't hаve ѕomewhere to go)
