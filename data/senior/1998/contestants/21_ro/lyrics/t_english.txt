I believe

Me, I am still waiting for you
I think it's not fair
That only your memory is left
I feel you are, all the time
Around me
Thought and spirit with which you capture me
You give me courage

I believe you are listening to me
I believe you are don't forget
Give me from the sky
A sign that you will stay
If I could only touch your world
I would ask for you back
I believe in us

I may be making a mistake
I don't know how to look at
The stars, and there to find you again
You come only in a dream
As you have promised
We stay good friends
Good friends

I believe you are listening to me
I believe you are don't forget
Give me from the sky
A sign that you will stay
If I could only touch your world
I would ask for you back
I believe in us

Sometimes I feel as if you are looking at me
I want you to know
You only give me silence

I believe you are listening to me
I believe you are don't forget
Give me from the sky
A sign that you will stay
Me, if I could only touch your world
I would ask for you back
I would ask for you bаck
I believe in uѕ
Ooh...
