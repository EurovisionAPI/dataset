What am I going to do without you?

You were the apple of my eyes
You were the queen of my heart
You were my world
All my course

A life in front of us
So many dreams to share
And in a moment
You forgot to live

What am I going to do without you
If you're no longer here?
How can I give you love?
So many kisses I haven't  given to you

What am I going to do without you
If you're no longer here?
What can I tell my heart
That doesn't stop repeating?
What will I do without you?

Now you have to go
I don't want to separate from you
If I don't have you
Why do I want to live?

What am I going to do without you
If you're no longer here?
How can I give you love?
So many kisses I haven't  given to you

What am I going to do without you
If you're no longer here?
What can I tell my heart
That doesn't stop repeating?
What am I going to do without you?

What am I going to do without you
If you're no longer here?
How can I give you love?
So many kisses I haven't  given to you

What am I going to do without you
If you're no longer here?
What can I tell my heart
That iѕ tired of repeating?
What аm I going to do without you?
