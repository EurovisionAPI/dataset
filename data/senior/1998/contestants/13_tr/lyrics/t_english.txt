You can't forget

My loneliness knocked on my silent door again
When I had forgotten the path to darkness
We have lost the yesterdays, longing for tomorrows
Cry, my heart cry, 'cause this is the final storm

It will be a waste for us, for our love
Don't draw us to sorrow in one breath
If my captivity to you is the only thing that you have left me
Cry my heart, there is a lot of time for the light

Why should our hands
Part our loving eyes?
Didn't our hearts stop beating, when we were apart?

You can't forget even if years pass by
Even if our hair begins to turn grey
No one can make us forget each other

My loneliness knocked on my silent door again
When I had forgotten the path to darkness
We have lost the yesterdays, longing for tomorrows
Cry, my heart cry, 'cause this is the final storm

Why should our hands
Part our loving eyes?
Didn't our hearts stop beating, when we were apart?

You can't forget even if years pass by
Even if our hair begins to turn grey
No one can make us forget each other

You can't forget even if years pass by
Even if our hair begins to turn grey
No one can make uѕ forget each other
