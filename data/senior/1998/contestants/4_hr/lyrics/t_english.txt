May the dawn never rise

Another day has passed by
Once more, the moon has come
Silently, like a dear guest
To abridge my mornings

For the sorrow leads me through the years
Steals the dream, till a new day dawns

May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you
May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you

Another day has passed by
Once more, the moon has come
Silently, like a dear guest
To abridge my mornings

For the sorrow leads me through the years
Steals the dream, till a new day dawns

May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you
May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you

May I not wake up without you
May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exiѕt
May I not wake up without you
May I not wаke up without you
