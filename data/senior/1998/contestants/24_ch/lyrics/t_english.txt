Let him

He serves cocktails every night
He wins all women over
Using his charm
You too let him bedazzle you
After a few hours, you were already in his arms

Let him go at last
He often walked out on you
It's only appearance
Let him be at last

How often he cheated you
You thought he would change
But you lied to yourself
Say, doesn't it hurt?

Saturday and you're looking forward for the night to come
You still have loads to do before you finish work
But you keep thinking about it
You can't get him out of your mind
You leave work
Even abandon your job

Let him go at last
He often walked out on you
It's only appearance
Let him be at last

How often he cheated you
You thought he would change
But you lied to yourself
Say, doesn't it hurt?

Let him go at last
He often walked out on you
It as only appearance
Let him be at last

How often he cheated you
You thought he would change
But you lied to yourself
Say, doesn't it hurt?

Sаy, doesn't it hurt?
It hurts ѕo much
