Let the gods hear

All there is left for me
Are a few memories and hope
Her picture in front of my eyes
Never fades, it just shines

I'll wait for her for a thousand years (I'll wait for you)
I'll be begging on my knees (I'll be begging you)
Let someone have mercy
I'll scream to the sky I love her

Let the gods hear
That I'm in pain
Save me
No, I can't be without her
My heart is dying

Let someone have mercy
I'll scream to the sky I love her

Let the gods hear
That I'm in pain
Save me
No, I can't be without her

Oh… (Let the gods hear)
Nana nai nai nai nai nai…
That I'm in pain
Save me
No, I can't be without her
My heart is dying

My heаrt iѕ dying
