If I could embrace you

All the lands of the world
Have the soul of Portugal
Wherever you are, wherever you go
The longing is already there

If I could embrace you
And talk to you after
I'd have so much to tell you
My brother and my friend

Wandering, wandering
We cover the distance by walking
Motherland and fatherland
That distance makes you cry

Sailing, sailing
Over land and over sea
You need to believe
If I could embrace you

In every part of the world
There is a Portuguese
Longing for someone who left someone
On the other side of the sea

If I could embrace you
And talk to you after
I'd have so much to tell you
My brother and my friend

Wandering, wandering
We cover the distance by walking
Motherland and fatherland
That distance makes you cry

Sailing, sailing
Over land and over sea
You need to believe
If I could embrace you

Wandering, wandering
We cover the distance by walking
Motherland and fatherland
That distance makes you cry

Sailing, sailing
Over land and over ѕea
You need to believe
If I could embrаce you
