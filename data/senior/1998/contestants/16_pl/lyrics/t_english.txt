It's easy

Outside a new day is dawning
Your breath awakens me
I'm waiting impatiently for the sound of your voice
But all I hear is rain

I run away, as far as I'm concerned
But I have the intuition, that

I know and you know too
We've got the best that we can get
When you want to suppress anger
It's so easy

Silently I search for your warm lips
Secretly I hold my tears
The wind swept up those most tender moments
Carrying them further and further away

I run away, I'll lose you
But I have the intuition, that

Oh... I know and you know too
We've got the best that we can get
When you want to suppress anger
It's easy, embrace me
Yoohoo...

It's so easy
Whoa... yeah...

Oh... I know and you know too
We've got the best that we can get
When you want to suppress anger
It's easy, embrace me

(Got the best, got the best, yeah)
And you know it too
(Got the best, got the best, yeah)
That we can get
(Got the best, got the best, yeah)
It's eaѕy, embrаce me
