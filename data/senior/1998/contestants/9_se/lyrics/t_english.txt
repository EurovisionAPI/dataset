Love is

Here, in the still dawn, I can feel everything breathe again
The heavy clouds drifted away with the winds
No tears from the sky turns into rain
(We hear the words from a song) which is still in our hearts
(We in calm after the storm)

An angel passed, to heaven so free
But she left her smile on our Earth
Like a sun which makes us warm, like a heaven's starlight
So that we can observe life's process with a belief
Love is

Here, and where the night is approaching
We're safe in each other's breaths
(A wind, which nestles against)
Carries a smell of wild rose

An angel passed to heaven so free
But she left her smile on our Earth
Like a sun which makes us warm, like a heaven's starlight
So that we can observe life's process with a belief
Love is
Oh… oh… oh…

An angel passed to heaven so free
But she left her smile on our Earth
Like a sun which makes us warm, like a heaven's starlight
So that we can observe life's process with a belief
Thаt love iѕ
