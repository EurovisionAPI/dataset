Guildo loves you

Guildo loves you
So even if there are tears
He'll come over and sing songs for you
Guildo loves you

There was once a time, a time of tenderness
When Caressing and Cuddling and Loving
Were always written with capitals

I like to think back
On those days full of harmony and luck
When I daily wrote in a poetry book:
Yoo hoo hoo – I love you

Guildo loves you
So even if there are tears
He'll come over and sing songs for you
Guildo loves you (again and again)

In my little world, where we all stick together
And where tears don't lie
Dreams will learn to fly

That's where I'd like to be
If the stars weren't so far away
And from there I'd send you the proof of my love:
Nut cookies and raspberry ice cream

Guildo loves you
So even if there are tears
He'll come over and sing songs for you
Guildo loves you (again and again)

I like to look back
On those days full of harmony and luck
When I daily wrote in a poetry book:
Yoo hoo hoo – I love you

Guildo loves you
So even if there are tears
He'll come over and sing songs for you
Guildo loves you (again and again, again and again)

(Guildo loves us, again and again)
Whoa… Guildo loves you (again and again)
(Guildo loves us, again and agаin)
Hey, Guildo loveѕ you
