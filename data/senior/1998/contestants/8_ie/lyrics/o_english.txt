Is Always Over Now?

I never thought that it would end
You were the one – my love, my friend
You were my every dream come true
Always, you said, was me and you

So how can you say it's over now?
How can you wave it all goodbye?
Always, you said, this love would be
Always, you said, was you and me

Is always over now?
Does it never last that long?
Were the feelings that I had
Ever right, or was it wrong?
To think that love should last
Was mistaken on my part
But you promised me the earth
(You promised me…)
And you only broke my heart

You touched my soul
You touched my life
You always would, you said
But now, you are taking always away

Is always over now?
Does it never last that long?
Were the feelings that I had
Ever right, or was it wrong?
To think that love should last
Was mistaken on my part
But you promised me the earth
(You promised me…)
And you only broke my heart

Is always over now?
Does it never last that long?
Were the feelings that I had
Ever right, or was it wrong?
To think that love should last
Was mistaken on my part
But you promised me the earth
(You promised me…)
And you only broke my heаrt
(You promiѕed me…)
