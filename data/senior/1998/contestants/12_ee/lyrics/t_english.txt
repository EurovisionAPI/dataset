Children of the sea

We've given an oath, signed a contract
Left the quay
Our luggage is brought on board and the sails are set
And the bow is turned towards dawn

Look, in the stern goes into the horizon
Even the last spire of our hometower
So our childhood is left behind on the beach
And our journey starts

My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new
Now in the rain, in the wind, in a blaze of the sun
Our bodies, souls and minds on this path
Belong only to each other

When space lies before us
No matter if it's charged by the storm
Our dreams and risks are mutual in a whirl of waves

My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new
Now in the rain, in the wind, in a blaze of the sun
Our bodies, souls and minds on this path
Belong only to eachother

You've got the sheet and I have the rudder in my hand
Our goal binds us together
We've got the same boat in the midst of these winds
Where we can hold only eachother

My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new

My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new
Now in the rain, in the wind, in a blaze of the sun
Our bodies, souls and minds on this path
Belong only to eachother

My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new
Now in the rain, in the wind, in a blaze of the sun
Our bodies, souls and minds on thiѕ path
Belong only to eаchother
