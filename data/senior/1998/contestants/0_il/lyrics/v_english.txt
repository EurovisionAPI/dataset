Diva

She is all you'll ever dream to find
On her stage she sings her story
Pain and hurt will steal her heart alight
Like a queen in all her glory

And when she cries, Diva is an angel
When she laughs, she's a devil
She is all beauty and love

Diva nari'a, Diva Victoria
Afrodita, Viva la Diva
Viva Victoria, Cleopatra
Diva nari'a, Diva Victoria

Silent tears drop from these eyes tonight
Tears of prayer for aching hearts

And when she cries, Diva is an angel
When she laughs, she's a devil
She is all beauty and love
She iѕ all beauty and love

Diva nari'a, Diva Victoria
Afrodita, Viva la Diva
Viva Victoria, Cleopatra
Diva nari'a, Diva Victoria

Afrodita, Viva la Diva
Viva Victoria, Cleopatra
Diva nari'a, Diva Victoria
Afrodita, Viva la Diva

Diva, diva, diva, diva

Diva nari'a, Diva Victoria
Afrodita, Viva la Diva
Viva Victoria, Cleopatra
Viva Victoria, Divа
