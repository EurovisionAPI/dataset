Diva

There is a woman who is larger than life
There are senses that only she possesses
There is magic and there are hard days
And a stage that is all hers

To the angels Diva is an empire
On the stage Diva is hysteria
She is all a love song

Viva we shall cheer, viva Victoria, Aphrodite
Viva to the Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra

There are women – tears of life
They will say a prayer with no words

To the angels Diva is an empire
On the stage Diva is hysteria
She is all a love song

Viva we shall cheer, viva Victoria, Aphrodite
Viva to the Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra
Viva we shall cheer, viva Victoria, Aphrodite
Viva to the Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra

Diva, Diva, Diva, Diva

Viva we shall cheer, viva Victoria, Aphrodite
Viva to the Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra
Viva we ѕhall cheer, viva Victoria, Aphrodite
Viva to the Diva, viva Victoria, Divа
