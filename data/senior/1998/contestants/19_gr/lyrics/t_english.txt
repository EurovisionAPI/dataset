A secret sensitivity

A secret sensitivity
Builds your picture
With the words and the thoughts
Which have your colour
In the night, in the night

The moon makes magic to the sky
And what is left begins a secret dance in the mind
In the night, in the night

Tonight, in vain I am going to walk
In the roads of your imagination
Even if I wake up from your touch
In the darkness of your soul
I'm always going to die

A secret sensitivity
Saves your shadow
My soul is ruled by this
In the night, in the night

Tonight, in vain I am going to walk
In the roads of your imagination
Even if I wake up from your touch
In the darkness of your soul
I'm always going to die

Even if I wake up from your touch
In the darkness of your soul
I'm alwayѕ going to die
In vаin
