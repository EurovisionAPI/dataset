A prayer

Love is fading out, I feel scared
How to survive without our dreams
I want to return, to stop the time
May sadness vanish with the darkness
You go away and hope to find
The world of splendour and fame
You give up and deny our love
So go there, hurry up
Without useless lies
And false words

Love, I am walking the valley of tears
Only you can get me out of misery
I long to touch your hands, your lips
Please, come back, do not give up
You are left alone and i know, that they're close
But I know, the day of your return
Is close, I know it will come
I'm waiting for you, come, away with sadness
I want your love and passion
I want your tenderness
I want everything you have got

A prayer of love, forever
A prayer of passion and tenderness
A prayer of love, hoping in miracles
Inside of us
Inside of us

Love, I am walking the valley of tears
Only you can get me out of misery
I long to touch your hands, your lips
Please, come back, do not give up
You are left alone and I know, that they're close
But I know, the day of your return
Is close, I know it will come
I'm waiting for you, come, away with sadness
I want your love and passion
I want your tenderness
I want everything you have got

A prayer of love, forever
A prayer of passion and tenderness
A prayer of love, hoping in mirаcles
Inside of us, only us
Inside of uѕ
