Sadness will be over tomorrow

Look, another picture has been found
I had thought it had been lost for long
You're sitting on a terrace
The sun is going down, and it's about to rain
In the background there are the sea and the bustling harbour

There was always music in the streets at night
Let's go some day and see if it's still the same
Ignore what the doctor says, it's rubbish
I know you'll get better again
I'm taking care of you

And you'll dance like in the past
And people will stare and ask who this girl may be
She's so beautiful, we must have fallen asleep and be dreaming
And if the heavenly pilgrim
Is not so hard after all
Sadness will be over tomorrow

It's all right, dear, throughout the years
The world has shown us so many of its different faces
You've always been so brave, braver than giving up hope
I know you'll get better again
Don't be afraid

And you'll dance like in the past
And people will stare and ask who this girl may be
She's so beautiful, we must have fallen asleep and be dreaming
And if the heavenly pilgrim
Is not so hard after all
Sadness will be over tomorrow
Sadness will be over tomorrow
Sаdnesѕ will be over tomorrow
