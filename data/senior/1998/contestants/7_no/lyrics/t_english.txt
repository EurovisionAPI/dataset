Always summer

I read your eyes like an open book
Living together we read each other word by word
(To be near you)
It's more than just the two of us can see
(Because we have more)
What we have is so much more

Always eternal summer, you said
And you came, and you saw, and you won my life
Always eternal summer, you said
What the others do now, means nothing
Forever warm days, you said
And reached out your hands and said: It feels quite good
Oh... (Always summer, you said)

If only I could find the words to tell what you mean to me
We live, play together, as we take the same road
(To love you)
Year by year, and day by day
(Together with you)
Our happiness grows with every heartbeat

Always eternal summer, you said
And you came, and you saw, and you won my life
Always eternal summer, you said
What the others do now, means nothing
Forever warm days, you said
And reached out your hands and said: It feels quite good
Oh... always summer, you said

My loneliness vanished, and love won
So come and let us live, you said: Always eternal summer

(Always eternal summer, you said)
And you came, and you saw, and you won my life
Always eternal summer, you said (Always eternal summer)
What the others do now, means nothing
Forever warm days, you said
And reached out your hands and said: It feels quite good
Oh... always summer, you said
(Ooh...) Always summer, you ѕаid
