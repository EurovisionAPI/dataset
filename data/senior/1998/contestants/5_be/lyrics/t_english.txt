Say yes

Come
If you are tired of your vacuous loves
If you no longer believe in "never" or "forever"
If you want to slow down and have a little rest
If you believe that we could be happy

Come
If you can't be there anymore to compete
I want to warm up from the light of your smile
We will fill the air with the sound of our laughter
You have to be able to leave someday

Say yes – you know the earth is beautiful
Say yes – when we are in unanimity
And then the world needs reconstruction
Say yes – come for life, come for an hour

See
Something has changed in the sky this morning
It seems the air is purer and that's good
You know, the keys to the future are in our hands
So then, when will you join me?

Say yes – at least we'll be together
Say yes – we'll be much stronger together
And then, and then we are similar
Say yes – I want to learn you by heart

You can't stand those bombs
Which all explode around us
You dream of another world
Where money won't rule everything
So stop listening to those
Who keep telling you we're wrong
You know, it's enough to be two
To believe we are already stronger

Come
If you are tired of your vacuous loves
If you no longer believe in "never" or "forever"
If you want to slow down and have a little rest
If you believe that we could be happy

Say yes – you know the earth is beautiful
Say yes – when we are in unanimity
And then the world needs reconstruction
Say yes – come for life, come for an hour

Say yes
