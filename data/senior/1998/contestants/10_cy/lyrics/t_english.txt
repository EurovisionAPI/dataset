Genesis

Strange and peculiar love
Hope on the dance of the wind
Beautiful goddess at the crossroads
Of ancient omnipotent races

In the mouths of your people, little homeland
You have placed a formidable word
I know, holding firm somewhere inside you
Is that boundless, global virtue

Genesis (Genesis)
Universal truth
Resurrection of light
Spring's dance of freedom

Genesis (Genesis)
On the prehistoric Earth
The primordial cry
The celebration of youth and freedom
Genesis, Genesis

At the sunset of the century, an illusion
Arises, separates, divides
But another truth unites us
Belief in peace, resistance

Genesis (Genesis)
Universal truth
Resurrection of light
Spring's dance of freedom

Genesis (Genesis)
On the prehistoric Earth
The primordial cry
The celebration of youth and freedom

Genesis (Genesis)
On the prehistoric Earth
The primordial cry
The celebration of youth аnd freedom
Genesis, Genesiѕ
