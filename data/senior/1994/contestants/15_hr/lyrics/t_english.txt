You may have all the love

Rain from the north is coming
The pillow smells nice, but your infidelity is hurting me
You're not here, the morning awakens me
He who kissed you destroyed memories in my eyes

Someone took you away from me
You sold me, whoa…
I'm fighting for love, but don't have the strength
No, I don't have the strength

You may have all the love (All)
My soul is too tired
The biggest pain is going through my veins
But you won't disappear from inside me, oh…
Won't disappear, oh…

You don't love me, you don't love me anymore
My love would have lasted a hundred years

You may have all the love (All)
My soul is too tired
The biggest pain is going through my veins

You may have all the love (All)
My soul is too tired
But you won't disappear from inside me, oh…
Won't diѕappeаr

Ooh…
