Bye Bye Baby

When I looked at your blue eyes
I believed so to find happiness from you
I loved you, forgot the others
I wanted you to be my own

But I got to hear
That I'm not the only one for you
Now I close the door last time carefully
You are history to me

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
I'll go away, though I'm left alone
Bye bye baby, baby, goodbye
I won't cry, when this ends

When I take a look back, you're only a memory
A memory of a past love
You'll find another
Who falls in love with you, believes your lies

Still I'll trust in love, the eternal power
I have a destination, yesterday stays behind
It was a deceptive dream

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
I'll go away, though I'm left alone
Bye bye baby, baby, goodbye
I won't cry, when this ends

If I dare start love again
Maybe tomorrow reaches happiness again

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
I'll go away, though I'm left alone
Bye bye baby, baby, goodbye
I won't cry, when this ends

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
I'll go away, though I'm left alone
Bye bye baby, bаby, goodbye
I won't cry, when this endѕ
