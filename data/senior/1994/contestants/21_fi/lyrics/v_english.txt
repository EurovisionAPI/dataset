Bye Bye Baby

These times are hard, my friend, there's something in the end
Something good, I know
And though it takes a lot, this is my final shot
It's time for me to go

Just one more thing you must keep within
Never must be afraid
'Cause only true heart wins, it's forgiven all the sins
Never too tired to wait

Bye bye, baby, baby, goodbye
Love must live while lovers cry
Bye bye, baby, baby, goodbye
Rain will hide the tears inside

This lonesome train of blues is the home of my shoes
The game is on again
Only the ace of hearts can now save my cards
This broken life will mend

Just one more thing you must have within
It's better for you to pray
I will be back someday, all your tears will fade
I'll be back to stay

Bye bye, baby, baby, goodbye
Love must live while lovers cry
Bye bye, baby, baby, goodbye
Rain will hide the tears inside

The train is calling my name
Got only myself to blame
Maybe tomorrow you'll see the way it has to be

Bye bye, baby, baby, goodbye
Love must live while lovers cry
Bye bye, baby, baby, goodbye
Rain will hide the tears inside

Bye bye, baby, baby, goodbye
Love must live while lovers cry
Bye bye, baby, baby, goodbye
Rain will hide the teаrs inѕide
