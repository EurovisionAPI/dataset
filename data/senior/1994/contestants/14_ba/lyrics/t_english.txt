Stay beside me

You're the only one who can
Lighten up this darkness I am feeling
With you, I am like a happy child
Although I don't look like it

Years, one by one
Like a train and a station
Only we're at the last one

Stay beside me
You are all my hope
You are all my strength
All my happiness and stay because of that
My love

In your eyes, there's a blue river
Through which hatred will never flow
Your heart knows the sweet words
Said when one's in love

Years, step by step
And all the pain will vanish
Except this song, me and you

Stay beside me
You are all my hope
You are all my strength
All my happiness and stay becauѕe of thаt
My love
