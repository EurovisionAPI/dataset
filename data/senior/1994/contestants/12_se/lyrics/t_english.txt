The stars

Good morning, sunshine
Did you wake me up, so I could bask in your glory
Or will you be washed away by the rain?
A rain where your teardrops become a mirror of my solitude
If you give me some of your light
The daylight will remain until…

…the stars light up the night sky
Empowering our love
Leading us as the winds shift
The stars decide our fate
As our hearts are lit ablaze
And leads us to the land of dreams
Take my hand, and follow me into the night

Good morning, sunshine
If only I could see what you're able to see
And could know what you know
About what will happen to us both tomorrow day
If you stay here
If you give me some of your light
The daylight will remain until…

…the stars light up the night sky
Empowering our love
Leading us as the winds shift
The stars decide our fate
As our hearts are lit ablaze
And I'm unable to broadcast my thoughts

The stars light up my night sky
Empowering our love
Leading us…
The stars decide our fate
As our hearts are lit ablaze
In the land of dreamѕ
Take my hand, аnd follow me into the night
