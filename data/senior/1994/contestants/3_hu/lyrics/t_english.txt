Whom can I tell my sins?

Nothing is there, only the lightless night
Only the wordless distress, a vain hope
No faith, no love
No one to stroke my hand

Whom can I tell my sins
And who should I ask for forgiveness?
Whom can I tell my sins, my God?

The night is cold, but I long for light
Like a pair of swallows moving south
My body is only a chilling dream
But my soul is a resting phoenix

Whom can I tell my sins
And who should I ask for forgiveness?
Whom can I tell my sins, my God?

Don't torment me
Because I'm standing in front of you naked
With blindfolded eyes
My God, tell me why

I cry without tears
To my unborn child

How can I tell my sins
And who should I ask for forgiveness?
Whom can I tell my sins
I need to live with my guilt
Who should I ask for forgiveness?
Whom cаn I tell my sinѕ, my God?
