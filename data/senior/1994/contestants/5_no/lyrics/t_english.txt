Duet

With your song, warmth enters
Brings spring into a frozen mind
Through ice, the song finds its way
To a river, deep inside me

The ice melts, the river awakens
The power of the flood fills mind and body
First as tears from a spring
Inside yourself that breaks free

And now the waterfall is free and wild
Like dancers of fire, a powerful current
We are one with the warmth of our blood
With the strength of our faith in a song

Dare to give to set the spring loose
The song lives under everything that froze
The flood turns into a waterfall
The spring in crystal breaks through

And now the waterfall is free and wild
Like dancers of fire, a powerful current
We are one with the warmth of our blood
With the strength of our faith in a song

Free, like flames in a dance
Duet in mind and sense for the first time
We are one with the warmth of our blood
With the strength of our faith
