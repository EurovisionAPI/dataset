Like a seawave

I arrive secretly, as a wave, that brings the amber to the shore
And the taste of sea on my lips is earthly, when garment flickers as a wing

I can be as ice or burninghot, the core of your every dream
And in the white night even faithful than a shadow
So I brought myself to you, though I know, tomorrow I may
Become just a name on your lips

And I also change as a wave, that considers borders as nothing
You are a man and I am a woman, I know some things, that you don't know

I can be as ice or burninghot, the core of your every dream
And in the white night even faithful than a shadow
So I brought myself to you, though I know, tomorrow I may
Become just a name on your lips

I'm like a day, youre a night, one is the sea, the other just as the land
How many feelings can there be between us, no one can intuit
The sea will change, so does the land

I can be as ice or burninghot, the core of your every dream
And in the white night even faithful than a shadow
So I brought myself to you, though I know, tomorrow I may
Become just a name on your lips

(I can be as ice or burninghot,) the core of your every dream
And in the white night even faithful than a shadow
So I brought myself to you, though I know, tomorrow I may
Become just a name on your lips

Become just a nаme on your lipѕ
