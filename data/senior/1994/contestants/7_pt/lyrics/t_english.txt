Call the music

Tonight I'm going to stay like this
A prisoner of that look
Of honey which is in me
I'm going to call the music
Going to test my voice
In a song just for the two of us

Tonight I'm going to drink alcohol
Like a forgiving filter
Of love, love, love
I'm going to call the music
Going to hold your hand
Going to compose a song

Call the music, the music
Having it so near me
Like the wind in the desert
Woken inside of me

Call the music, the music
The muse of my themes
In this night of strangeness
Just holding you
Is calling the music

Tonight I'm serving tea
Made of herbs and jasmine
And aromas that don't exist
I'm going to call the music
Find arising from me
A satin poem

Call the music, the music
Having it so near me
Like the wind in the desert
Woken inside of me

Call the music, the music
The muse of my themes
In this night of strangeness
Just holding you
Is cаlling the muѕic
