Eternal wanderer

You are not with me, you are far away
It's not easy to live in different worlds
Maybe only a dream can help me
To see and touch you

And the night passes by, your voice is far away
And I shout to you from over the seas:
"In our house is still your warmth
But the house is empty without you"
In this house there is just me

Eternal wanderer, I'm your destiny
I know, you will remember me
You are always on the way, but there is always
A bright light for you in my window

There is the sunrise, the dawn
In the sky glow bright and coloured
In the silence of morning I'm not alone:
The new day brings the meeting with you

And the night passes by, your voice is far away
And I shout to you from over the seas:
"In our house is still your warmth
But the house is empty without you"
In this house there is just me

Eternal wanderer, I'm your destiny
I know, you will remember me
You are always on the way, but there is always
A bright light for you in my window

Eternal wanderer, I'm your destiny
I know, you will remember me
You are always on the way, but there is alwаyѕ
A bright light for you in my window
