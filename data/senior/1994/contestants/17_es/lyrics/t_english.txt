She's not her

When I'm with her
I'm a labyrinth of indecision
When I'm with her
I play with my imagination
She gives me her smile
And, in my hurry, I usually drown myself
And tell her to stop
And she pursues my moments of fire

She, she's not her
She's the other woman, the one that motivates me
And she's in my memory
The other woman is the one I could never forget

No, she, she's not her
She's the other woman, the one that excites me
And burns my clothes
The other woman is the stone and I'm the volcano

When I'm with her
I know everything gets worse
And when I think of the other one
I'm almost, almost a god
She brings down the moon for me
The other woman awakes my animal instinct
The other woman is my luck
My naked muse, my best remedy

She, she's not her
She's the other woman, the one that motivates me
And she's in my memory
The other woman is the one I could never forget

No, she, she's not her
She's the other womab, the one that excites me
And burns my clothes
The other woman is the ѕtone and I'm the volcаno
