I'm praying

I'm praying for someone who has not yet realized
That life just has a big pain
Who believes what is written, will be certainly reborn
On a great and sweet day

I'm praying for you, for all the evil around
Which surrounds life
I'm praying for everybody, for the destroyed dreams
Why don't you believe it?

I'm praying tomorrow, the sky, the sun, the stars
To forgive all the sins
I'm praying for those who are looking for love
And don't know where

I'm praying for you, for all the evil around
Which sorrounds life
I'm praying for everybody, for the destroyed dreams
Why don't you believe it?

I'm praying tomorrow, the sky, the sun, the stars
To forgive all the sins
I'm praying for those who are looking for love
And don't know where

I'm praying in the silence of memories
That the time of my dreams may stay here again
A light will shine for those who know
How to find the sun in the dаrknesѕ
