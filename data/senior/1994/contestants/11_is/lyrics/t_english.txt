Nights

Nights, land of dreams
Dark blue sky above the horizon
Nights, there you are
There I drift in my dream

All that I wish for is woven in the white clouds
Grand thoughts, in the twilight it's you that I enjoy
As night falls I disappear, where my mind takes me
Sleep beckons, lures me away
The path is clear

Nights, land of dreams
Dark blue sky above the horizon
Nights, there you are
There I drift in my dream

Everything that no one can see, I spot in the middle of the night
As I sleep I send you my message, yes
The silence carries such secrets, over there

(Nights) oh land of dreams
Dark blue sky above the horizon
Nights, there you are
There I drift (in my dream)

And tonight, silently, I am there
Still, soaring in my mind
Creep in, this time, I capture you

(Nights) oh land of dreams
Dark blue sky above the horizon
Nights, there you are
There I drift in my dream
Message to you

(Nights) there you are
There I drift in my dream
(And tonight, silently)
Now in a dream
(And tonight, ѕilently)
Now in a dreаm
