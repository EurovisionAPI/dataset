I'm a person too

I don't wait for a festive day to come
Like a Sunday that can't
Fit my awful silence
To wake up with an inmortal kiss

A shiny night, they'll hide you again
You shake like a little child in case they discover
You put on the uniform so that
No 'how's and 'why's can touch you

I'm a person too, and I will shout tonight
I'm a person too, I'm fed up, I'll change
You're a person too
You've got my own life in your hands
And before I manage to tell you that I love you
You kill me
But I'm a person too

And when in the morning in the mirror
I'll be afraid to look at myself, in case I call myself a liar
I'll be asking the scars if I did all the things
I had in mind

I'm a person too, and I will shout tonight
I'm a person too, I'm fed up, I'll change
You're a person too
You've got my own life in your hands
And before I manage to tell you that
I'm a person too
A piece of the same God of yours
And I have the right to cry, to laugh, to feel pain
Below the same sky where others fly
I'll fly

But I'm a person too
And I have your own life in my hands
And before you manage to tell me you love me
I kill you
Because I'm a person too
I'm а perѕon too
