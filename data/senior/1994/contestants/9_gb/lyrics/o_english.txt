We Will Be Free (Lonely Symphony)

Walk into the box
Let your secrets out
Time for confession
Purify your soul
Denounce the devil from within
No time for aggression
Don't wait up in vain
Love has lost its way
We live in segregation
Can't you see the piece of dust
That crumbles in your hand is me?
Give me some affection

And though my heart is broken
My picture is forgotten
But I still believe
That I can see
A piece of me reflecting in your eye

(We will rise)
(Never fall) Never fall
(We will be free) And we will be free
(We will rise) We will rise
(Never fall again) We'll never fall again
(We will be free) And we will be free

Welcome to the land
Where all our dreams are planned
And fighting is a thing to do
Sometimes it makes me feel
Naked like a tree in autumn
And through the clouds and rain
Love has come to stake its claim
In an ugly way
And while you dance beneath an angry star
I'm chasing rainbows across the sun

And in this mad equation
I still believe that we can be
In harmony, you and me
A chorus in your lonely symphony

(We will rise)
(Never fall) We'll never fall
(We will be free) And we will be free
(We will rise) We will rise
(Never fall again) We'll never fall again
(We will be free) And we will be free
(We will rise)
(Never fall) We'll never fall
(We will be free) And we will be free

And in this mad equation
I still believe that we can be
In harmony
You and me
A chorus in your lonely symphony

(We will rise)
(Never fall) We'll never fall
(We will be free) And we will be free
(We will rise) We will rise
(Never fall again) We'll never fall again
(We will be free) And we will be free

We'll never fall
We will be free
With a little love
(We will riѕe) We will be free
(Never fall again) We'll never fаll
(We will be free) And we will be free
