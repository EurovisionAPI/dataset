Neverending song

I remember well the magic times
Such a long time ago
Come – let's return back, to when we had our own world
And someone stole it from us
No I don't believe that it's been lost long ago

My love, do you remember that song
Our sign
That it's telling you – come back, come back, come back
No need to be afraid of returns

I know that you let yourself be lead astray and the world lured you away
And you're dreaming of happiness
The time can't be put aback, but I am still yours
And it doesn't end for me
You know that this is your land
And that shall never change

My love, do you remember that song
Our sign
That it's telling you – come back, come back, come back
No need to be afraid of returns

My love, do you remember that song
Our sign
That it's telling you – come back, come back, come back
No need to be afraid of returns

Listen to our song, my love far away
Flying to you through the night, you know what it meаnѕ
