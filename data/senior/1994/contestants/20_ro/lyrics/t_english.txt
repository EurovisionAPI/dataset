Beyond the clouds

The coming day you may listen to me
I have chosen the bad as well as the good
Part of myself I leave in your hands

Nights without dreams, questions without answer
I wake up my hidden soul from my memories

Beyond the clouds, there is a ray of light
Beyond the clouds, there is my world, the world

I am not asking for forgiveness for all I have done
I am asking for a ray of love to start all over again

I now have the power now to make a change in the world
I have the power to dreаm

(Beyond the clouds, beyond the clouds)
Beyond the clouds
(Beyond the clouds)
There is my world, there is my world
(Beyond the clouds)
There is my world, world, world, world, world
(Beyond the clouds)
There is my world

(Beyond the clouds)
There iѕ my world
