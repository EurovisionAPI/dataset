Sweethearts' lullaby

The smell of your lips is like rain
To touch them is sinful, and for fulfillment I pray

Yet so deep is the heaven of yours
Flowers, like you, are crying without love
And dreaming dreams same as you

My dream is pouring you its wine
In that night of ours

My chord untouched
You are, untouched by me
My dream is pouring you its wine
