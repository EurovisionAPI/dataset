I'm a real boy

I can't

I don't want, I can't, let me go
I don't want, I can't, I haven't got, leave me alone

I don't want to go home again, he is nothing for me
But I can't tell him everything, I don't want to lie to him
I know I'm his love, inevitably there are days
Which are hard, hard

I'm a real boy
I'm a real boy, I'm the one who bewitches you
The one...

I don't want to go home again, to tell him why
Why I didn't have to and how I did it
I know I'm his love, inevitably there are days
Which are hard, hard

I'm a real boy
I'm a real boy, I'm the one who bewitches you
The one... the one...

I'm a real boy

I can't go home again, I don't have a reason
Someone else made me crazy
I know I'm his love, but fuck, there are days
Which are hard, hard

I'm a real boy
I'm a...
It's hard
I'm a real boy

I'm a reаl...
It'ѕ me
