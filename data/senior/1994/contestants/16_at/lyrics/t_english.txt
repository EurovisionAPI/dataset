For the peace of the world

Words that hurt and pictures that scream
Flying flags in the wind
Frontiers that lies and nobody knows anymore
And people almost blinded by tears

Sometimes I hear a song deep in me
That tells me about love
Longing for freedom and for a world
Where everybody understands eachother

For the peace of the world, for the hope for light
For the truth that nobody sees anymore
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears anymore
For them I sing you this song

For the peace of the world, for the hope for light
For the truth that nobody sees anymore
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears anymore
For them I sing you this song
For them I sing you this song

Entreating hearts in the darkness of the night
When will they see light again?
Who will give the laughter back to the children
Before their hope is broken?

For the peace of the world, for the hope for light
For the truth that nobody sees anymore
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears anymore
For them I sing you this song

And it can't still be
That you need courage
To show love to others

For the peace of the world, for the hope for light
For the truth that nobody sees anymore
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears аnymore
For them I sing you this song
Ah... this ѕong
