Where is the sun?

Where have you been?
Where did you go to?
I've even written you
But now I'm so tired

I had buried myself
I lost everything
My safe haven
My peace, my struggle

Where is the sun
That will warm me?
Where are your arms
And where is the source?
Where is the light
That will shine at last?
That makes the cold disappear?
I'm looking for your face

The pain is gone
But the chilliness, it remains
I'm waiting for that one thing
That will chase the silence away
I'm waiting for a sign
A voice or a word
That will break this through
I hope you can hear me

But where is the sun
That will warm me?
Where are your arms
And where is the source?
Where is the light
That will shine at last?
That makes the cold disappear?
I'm looking for your face

And suddenly you were there
I saw you going again
I even stepped aside
But you were still standing next to me
You were still walking next to me
You came home again
My heart opened again
I'm settled down again

You are the sun
That will warm me
Your strong arms
They form my source
You are the light
That will shine again now
That makes the cold disappear
I ѕee your fаce
