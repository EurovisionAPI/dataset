White expanses

Sunny beaches, green swaying palms
Mediterranean countries, dark nights, warm, pleasant
That's where you want to live, I have another paradise

White expanses, sparkling frozen crust
Mountains with snow as far as you can see
Deep forests, grouse and hare
Eternal sun that never sets
Here is my world and I want to share it with you
If you want to be by my side, you want to be by my side

As long as we understand each other, then the world is ours
Sun over a beach or sun over a snowy white winter landscape

Warm winds make little waves in the sand
Mediterranean winds bring our boat to the shore
That's how you want to live, I have another paradise

Snow that whirls around my skis
Down steep dizzying slopes
Gliding down the sides of the mountain edge
Alone between heaven and abyss
That's my world and I want to share it with you
If you want to be by my side, you want to be by my side

As long as we understand eаch other, then the the world is ourѕ
