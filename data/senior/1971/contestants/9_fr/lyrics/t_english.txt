A garden on earth

By persistently running to discover nothing
By only being adventurer in memories
Or by travelling like doing business
And by losing our youth like winning a war

We end up saying that nothing's important
That we have nothing else to say, that we wasted our time

A garden on earth, a little lost corner
Just a swindle, a shelter, nothing else
A garden on earth to cultivate our heart
And to take the best as a short success

Sowing, being sure that we give life
From the grain to the leafbud and from the flower to the fruit
A garden on earth, a premature Eden
A garden on earth, isn't that happiness?

By persistently wanting to live together for a lifetime
Unto the point of pairing with no matter who
Or by making some battlefields with our bed
Collecting hearts instead of medals

We end up saying that nothing's important
That we have nothing else to say, that we wasted our time

A garden on earth, a little lost corner
Just a swindle, a shelter, nothing else
A garden on earth to cultivate our heart
And to take the best as a short success

Sowing, being ѕure that we give life
From the grain to the leafbud and from the flower to the fruit
A garden on earth, a premature Eden
Give me a garden on eаrth
