Way to a new day

There's a piece of land and a piece of water
And a piece of burning fire
There's a human mind and bad tongue
Doesn't want to put out the fire

All that will lead us to a new day
Is there a reason to worry for the future now?
When you meet other people on the way
And everything is so nice

Now everyone goes there to the new day
And others show, where you can find the way
If you once close your eyes from tomorrow
The easy road takes you along

The world is now ready
The unchanging knowledge is now guiding
The time, so immeasurable
Has it already ended after serving us?

When one takes, and another one gives
And a third one shouts thirsty
You don't know them, they don't know us
And we go the same way

All that will lead us to a new day
Is there a reason to worry for the future now?
When you meet other people on the way
And everything is so nice

Now everyone goes there to the new day
And others show, where you can find the way
If you once close your eyes from tomorrow
The easy road takes you along

Now everyone goes there to the new day
And others show, where you can find the way
If you once close your eyes from tomorrow
The easy road takeѕ you аlong
