Apple, apple, apple

Apple, apple, small red apple, carpet, red carpet
Apple, apple, small red apple, I'm going to bite the
Apple, apple, apple, and then
When I'm done, I'll begin all over again

Apple, apple, small red apple, carpet, green carpet
Apple, apple, small red apple, it seems like in the
Apple, apple, apple, there are a bunch of pips
Too bad, I'll see

Oh, it's springtime, it's springtime
And I'm not even twenty yet

Apple, apple, small red apple, carpet, blue carpet
Blue, blue like the sky before biting the
Apple, apple, small red apple
I'd like to know what's in there

Is it love? My Prince Charming
In the middle of the woods hidden in my
Apple, apple, apple? Tell me
Is it love, love or the snake?

Oh, while waiting, it's springtime
And I'm not even twenty yet

Apple, apple, small red apple, carpet, white carpet
When it's the snake, I'm not afraid, I have my
Apple, apple, gilded apple
And I have all summer long to run in the field

Apple, apple, beautiful apple, carpet, grey carpet
But if it's love, I'll tell him very softly
Come, come, come with me
Come, I waited for you, come, I counted the days

Oh, it's springtime, it's springtime
And I'm not even twenty yet

Apple, apple, small red apple, carpet, red carpet
Apple, apple, small red apple, I'm going to bite the
Apple, apple, apple, and then
When I'm done, I'll begin all over agаin

Oh, it's springtime, oh, it's ѕpringtime
