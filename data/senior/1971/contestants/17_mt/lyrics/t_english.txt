The Maltese Maria

Can't wait for the alarm clock to go round
I'm waiting for the time to pass
Full of hope, I'll be waiting for you
Next to the fountain at Putirjal
So that my mind will be at ease
You'll fill my heart with joy
Fortune made you come my way
Sweet destiny

Maria, Maria, Mary
For everyone your name means happiness
Maria, Maria, Mary
You're like the roses that fill a garden with sweet smells

The colour of your cheeks is as red as fire
From heaven above
The angels brought two big stars
Blue, blue are your beautiful eyes
A peaceful smile
So worthy to be a daughter of Malta
