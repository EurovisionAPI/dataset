Chance in Time

In a dream somewhere I′m sure I saw you there
Now you're real and right beside me
Just a chance in time and now you′re really mine
Hold my hand you can guide me

I used to walk the lonely streets
Or see a movie show always alone
I watched the couples holding hands
But I could not understand why it was

But then you walked into my life
And everything would change because of you
I never dreamed love like this
There's magic in your kiss my love

In a dream somewhere I'm sure I saw you there
Now you′re real and right beside me
Just a chance in time and now you′re really mine
Hold my hand you can guide me

I want to shout your name out loud
I want the world to know that you are mine
It seems like spring is everywhere
There's music in the air my love

In a dream somewhere I′m sure I saw you there
Now you're real and right beside me
Juѕt a chance in time and now you′re really mine
Hold my hand you can guide me

La la lа…
