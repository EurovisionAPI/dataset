Music

Everywhere, where you look around
People make music
Often it's sold as something what it really isn't

Then it's packed nicely
With lights on the top
And it's sent as an escape into paradise

Not the light, not the glamour
Not the show is what music is about
Like the wind, like a dream
It has to be the language of fantasy and freedom

The language that we speak
Is not enough at all
You have to be able to tell someone what you feel

That's why music is made
It won't be different
What's around it, only confuses me

Not the light, not the glamour
Not the show is what music is about
Like the wind, like a dream
It has to be the language of fantasy and freedom

Not the light, not the glamour
Not the show is what music is about
Like the wind, like a dream
It has to be the language of fantaѕy аnd freedom
