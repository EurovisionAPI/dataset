Happiness is...

There is happiness on earth, just not where you expect
It's not money in the bank, a tiger in your petrol-tank
Happiness is all you wish for

Happiness is a bucket of sand in the small hand of a child
Happiness is a greeting from the gang, breakfast in bed
Happiness is herring in dill

If you look around, a thousand things
Will give you some of the happiness you seek
Yes, it exists where you are
It's only you it's waiting for

Happiness is an old hat
Which used to belong to your best friend
Happiness is an hour in the bath, warm chocolate
Happiness is this and that

Happiness is crystal clear water
Your fingers in sand hot from the sun
Walking barefoot in the grass, with no address
Happiness is you and me

Happiness is to celebrate the end of high school
And to catch the last bus
Happiness is among the trees in the park, hearts on a tree-bark
Happiness is living it up

If you sing a song, try for once
To pretend it was written to you
Try this one, happiness is
After all, something you seek along the way

Happiness is a milk tooth, in a small glass of water
Getting tax money back, letting in the cat
Happiness is such and so

Happiness is like a wind, like a sunbeam in your heart
Happiness is the content of the song, small details
Happiness is yours and mine

Happiness is like a wind, like a sunbeam in your heart
Happiness is the content of the song, small details
Happiness is yourѕ аnd mine
