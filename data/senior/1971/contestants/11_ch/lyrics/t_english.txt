The illusions of our twenties

Gentleman, you who have the experience of things in life
Gentleman, you who have survived your life
Let us now have our turn to live too

Oh, you who have remade the world and the time like us
Let us dream, dream now
Leave us the illusions of our twenties

Madam, you who have memories of the roses of life
Madam, you who have been so beautiful
Let us have our turn to love and live too

Oh, you who in the past only dreamt about waltzes and springs
Let us dance, dance now
Leave us the illusions of our twenties

Leаve us the illusions of our twenties
Twenties… twentieѕ…
