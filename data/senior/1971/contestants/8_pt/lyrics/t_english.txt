High ridge girl

(La la la…)

Girl of serene glance gleaming at the dawn
With small firm bosom in a little woolen waistcoat
Girl smelling like hay coupled with mint
Girl smelling like hay coupled with mint

Girl that in your path, are treading fairness
You bring in your eyes a nest of tenderness feathers
Girl of linen walking with a creek at the waist
Girl of linen walking with a creek at the waist

(Pa da ba da…)

Girl in a flounce skirt, whoever sees her becomes cleansed
Eyes' thirstiness water, bread that was never kneaded
Girl with a bundle of smiles, my pine tree sap
Girl in a flounce skirt, lavender without a flowerbed

(La la la…)

Girl of full body with dawning braids
Who wakes up before the flurried land
Girl of full body with dawning braids
Girl of full body with dawning braids

(Pa da ba da…)

Girl in a flounce skirt, whoever sees her becomes cleansed
Eyes' thirstiness water, bread that was never kneaded
Girl with a new dress, Hail Mary of the land
Wild rose, people's rose, high ridge breeze

(La la la…)
Wild rose, people's rose, high ridge breeze
(La la la…)
Wild rose, people's rose, high ridge breeze
(La la lа…)
Wild rose, people's roѕe, high ridge breeze
