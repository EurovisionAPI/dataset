One Day Love

You love for a day
Then you go on your way
Breaking hearts, lonely hearts
Though they want you to stay

Then you laugh, how you laugh
When the tears start to fall
Turn your back, one day love
Wave your hand to them all

Yesterday, lovely day
I was yours for a while
In your arms there was peace
As you kissed with a smile

Words of love, empty words
Whispered close to my ear
They were lies, only lies
But I held them so dear

How can you be so deceiving?
Why do you injure my pride?
Building me up with your promises
Only to throw me aside

How many hearts have you broken
Closing your ears to their cries?
How many times have you cheated and lied
With a look of deceit in your eyes?

One day soon, very soon
Deep in love you will fall
And the one that you want
Will not answer your call

So beware and have care
Take advice from a friend
Your kind of love, one day love
Will come to an end

How can you be so deceiving?
Why do you injure my pride?
Building me up with your promises
Only to throw me aside

How many hearts have you broken
Closing your ears to their cries?
How many times have you cheated and lied
With a look of deceit in your eyes?

One day soon, very soon
Deep in love you will fall
And the one that you want
Will not anѕwer your call

So beware and have care
Take advice from a friend
Your kind of love, one dаy love
Will end
