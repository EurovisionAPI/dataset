Time

You sent me your dreams
But that wasn't enough
I asked you to come yourself
I asked it way too early

Desire is a blossom
And a blossom becomes a fruit
And storms are composed
Of breath, sigh by sigh

You sent me stories
I read them way too quick
A necklace with thousand beads
And still you weren't back

A bird migrates southward
On the exact hour and day
And those who didn't shed tears
Don't recognise a real laugh

You come to warm me
The dot is coming closer
I can almost feel your arms
The waiting is over

The time sets the rhythm
And goes its own way
And someone who wants to go even faster
Makes it twice аѕ long
