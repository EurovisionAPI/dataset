Your boy is sad

I still think of the one who
Doesn't sleep beside me anymore
The night is long and dark like pain
The bed is empty, and so is the table

I don't know where she lives and whether she knows
That I still dream of her, somewhere without her
Because someone else is with her on a faraway journey
To the stars and beyond, without me

In some garden, you're still a rose
While I can't sleep, you know I'm feeling sad

Don't call me anymore, you know that
My journey is over without you

In another garden, you're still a rose
Your boy dreams of you, your boy is ѕаd
