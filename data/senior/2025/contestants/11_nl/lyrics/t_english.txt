That’s life

That's life
She sang to me
I remember
I was little
Oh I was just a little boy but I remember
The melody, the melody

It's like this, it's like that
It's up and it's down
It goes up, it goes down
And around and around
What will be, yes, will be
Here I am, here I go
Sing one, two, three

That's la-la-la-la life
That's la-la-la-la life
Yes, that's la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la life

That's life, and what a miracle
Sometimes in love, sometimes miserable
And I still hear my mama's voice inside of me
The melody, the melody

It's like this, it's like that
It's up and it's down
It goes up, it goes down
And around and around
What will be, yes, will be
Here I am, here I go
Sing one, two, three

That's la-la-la-la life
That's la-la-la-la life
Yes, that's la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la life

Yes, that's la-la-la-la life
Yes, that's la-la-la-la life
That's la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la life

Oh, that's life
Life in pink
Life in black
Oh, this rollercoaster
And I will sing until it's over
It goes la-la-la-la-la
(La-la-la-la-la)

It's like this, it's like that
It's up and it's down
It goes up, it goes down
And around and around
What will be, yes, will be
Listen to me, oh mama
Sing one, two, three
Thаt'ѕ life
