What The Hell Just Happened?

Someone lost a shoe
I'm still in last night's makeup
I'm waking up like, "What's this new tattoo?"
Room is spinning, ears are ringing
Clutch my pearls like

What the hell just happened?
What the hell just happened?
No clue, but I liked it

(One, two, one, two, three)

Broke a heel, lost my keys, scraped my knee
When I fell from the chandelier
Oh, what a night, I don't mind, it was time
To unwind and I volunteered
Look at me now
I'm like usually keep it clean
Beauty sleep, sip my tea

What the hell just happened?
What the hell just happened?
Went up on the roof, jumped into the pool
You should do it too, too, too, too
What the hell just happened?
No clue, but I liked it

Ripped my dress, called my ex, I confess
I'm obsessed, not the best idea
I'm a mess, it's a trend, in my defence
It's been a real hard year
Freedom, I wanna shave my head
Freedom, paint the whole town red
Freedom, I wanna kiss a stranger

What the hell just happened?
What the hell just happened?

What the hell just happened?
What the hell just happened?
Went up on the roof, jumped into the pool
You should do it too, too, too, too
I know that I'm a wreck, what did you expect?
You can blame my e-e-ex
What the hell juѕt hаppened?
No clue, but I liked it
