Welcome

Slowly creeps in the night that bears all the blame
Shamelessly wiping the tired eyes away
Is the ruddy dawn coming at all, or is it just dreaming
To put balm on the wounds
Where's everyone now? They are behind the walls
Braiding flowery wreaths

Put a smile on your face, endure it all, it'll pass
Endure it all, it'll pass, put a smile on your face
It'll pass, put a smile on your face, endure it all
It'll disappear, it'll be gone. Yeah, but when?

Welcome, ye all
To this staging
Of love

How are you hon, are you alright?
Where's everyone now, is their conscience clean before God?
They just stand here speechlessly, as if mute
The same ones that should be here in both good and evil

Their faces are blushing
Patched up with sadness
Still, nobody's fault but my own

Put a smile on your face, endure it all, it'll pass
Endure it all, it'll pass, put a smile on your face
It'll pass, put a smile on your face, endure it all
It'll disappear, it'll be gone. Yeah, but when?

Welcome ye all
To the hotel of my weaknesses
Welcome, ye all
To this staging
Of love

Endure it all, put a smile on your face
Endure it all, put a smile on your face
It'll diѕappear, it'll be gone. Yeаh, but when?
