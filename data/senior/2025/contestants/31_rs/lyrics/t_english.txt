Dear

May that be
My last supper
Let the eye of Cerberus
Drive me into the night
Let you be awakened
By the scent of memories
And my music
Of your name

Dear
You paid the price of me loving you
Dear
You brought back a life from the edge
There are many reasons for you
To love another
But I care so much to keep you

Let you be kissed
Who lies to you better
But let one have you
The one that risks it all

Dear
You paid the price of me loving you
Dear
You brought back a life from the edge
There are many reasons for you
To love another
But I care so much to keep you

Dear
You paid the price of me loving you
Dear
You brought back a life from the edge
There are many reasons for you
To love another
I care so much to keep you

(Dear)
You paid the price of me loving you
You paid the price, dear
(Dear)
(You brought back a life from the edge)
There are many reasons for you
To love another
I cаre ѕo much to keep you
