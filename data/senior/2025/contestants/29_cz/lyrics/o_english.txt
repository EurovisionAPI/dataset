Kiss Kiss Goodbye

Blow me a kiss goodbye
I don't want my tears to dry
One kiss of love, one kiss of desperation
In a moment two of us collide
There's no other place to hide
Only one survives, when the night arrives
Will you be my ride or die?

You
You seem so holy
It almost fooled me
Truly
When you said you loved me
It almost moved me

Kiss kiss goodbye (Kiss kiss goodbye)
Kiss kiss goodbye (Kiss kiss goodbye)
Now keep your half apologies
Drunk in apathy
Over and over again
Kiss kiss

Caught in the motion you're wearing me out
Tainted devotion, heart on the ground
Only one survives, when the night arrives
Will you be my ride or die?

Tell me why is that?
You
You seem so holy
It almost fooled me
Truly
When you said you loved me
It almost moved me

Kiss kiss goodbye (Kiss kiss goodbye)
Kiss kiss goodbye (Kiss kiss goodbye)
Now keep your half apologies
Drunk in apathy
Over and over again
(Kiss kiss)

Blow me a kiss goodbye
See how my tears run dry
One kiss of love, won't feel the same tonight

Uhh…
(Kiss kiss goodbye)
(Kiss kiss goodbye)
(Kiss kiss goodbye)
(Kiss kiss goodbye)
(Kiss kiss goodbye)

Now keep your half apologies
Drunk in apathy
Over and over agаin
Kiss kisѕ
