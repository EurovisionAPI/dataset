Poison Cake

It's cool now in the kitchen
That happens when you're bitten
I'm stirring and stirring
Deliciously pouring
And I know you're gonna love this
A better kind of justice
I don't want it burning

One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge
One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge

Made you something that I know you'll like
Chocolate-covered sugar and spice
Tasty, tasty, yum, yum, tasty
Candy colours oh so nice
Take a bite of my poison cake, yum

Poison cake

Take a bite of my poison cake
Been cooking in my cauldron late
You're never ever gonna stay awake
You're going down, down, down
You thought I was a servant slave
But I am just a serpent snake
You better genuflect and pray
You better genuflect and pray

Tingles of poison are hitting your veins
"What have you done?"
Your words are slurring as you fall down

One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge
One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge

Made you something that I know you'll like
Chocolate-covered sugar and spice
Tasty, tasty, yum, yum, tasty
Candy colours oh so nice
Take a bite of my…

Poison cake

It's not my fault, I got carried away
I lost control when I started to bake
A dash of death is bitter to swallow
Don't be scared, you'll be buried tomorrow
