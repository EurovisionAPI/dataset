Row

Rowing here, rowing there
Rowing through the waves
There is nothing that can stop me

Rowing here, rowing there
Rowing through the waves
There is nothing that can stop me

I place a plank on a plank
And call it a boat
If I sink today
It's no problem

With oars out of steel
That last for a year
With course towards the Faroe Islands
Yes, I am ready

I have a vest for a belt and waterproof shoes
Because the weather is rowdy and I've had enough

When the sea opens, the waves come
I'm alone on a boat looking for a better place
I haven't lost everything yet
But we hoist up the sails and set off again

Rowing here, rowing there
Rowing through the waves
There is nothing that can stop me

Rowing here, rowing there
Rowing through the waves
There is nothing that can stop me

I am still in a boat
Look at this, wow
Stopping in Greenland?
Yes, I am down

Steering at sea, I am a captain
Call me Gísli Marteinn
Many months since I last saw some sun
Want to spend the rest of my life out here at sea

When the sea opens, the waves come
I'm alone on a boat looking for a better place
I haven't lost everything yet
But we hoist up the sails and set off again

Rowing here, rowing there
Rowing through the waves
There is nothing that can stop me

Rowing here, rowing there
Rowing through the waves
There is nothing that can stop me

Rowing here, rowing there
Rowing through the waves
There is nothing that can stop me

Rowing here, rowing there
Rowing through the waves
There is nothing that can stop me
There is nothing that can stop me
There is nothing that can stop me

There is nothing that cаn ѕtop me
