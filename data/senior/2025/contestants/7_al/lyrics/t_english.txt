Fire

At this minute, at this moment, no more paranoia
After the rain the world seems like a rainbow
No ambulances, roaming the streets
No one arrogantly speaks
Forecast for today, true:
The skies still will be blue
Ending under the water
My mouth never dried up
Imagine a minute, try
Without soldiers
With no orphans crying
No bottles in the ocean
Diesel smelling like lilac
The freedom of speech
Taught in a school class

Carve in me a clean heart
I'll send the light, in my darkness, night
Aman, miserere
Aman, miserere

In my heart
In this heart of mine
This minute eternally lasts
Good people blast
Decent people
Dance in their soul
Hey, hop my soil
I'll never forget the cradle I was born
Oh, hey, my world
Continue to shine, shine, shine…

Fire
Fall upon our tribal wild dances
As avalanche echoes, on mountains, rolls down
Fire
The nameless and pure people
Fall and roll down the same
As seven knives the soul straightly pierce
Fire
Here the sea, the sand and the moon sleep
And the stars we do not see, trampled under the feet
Sleepwalking to be free
Fire
For flames and light starving
For you endlessly searching
In this shining darkness thirsting for brightness

Carve in me a clean heart
In the darkness, I'll send you the light
Aman, miserere
Aman, miserere

In my pulsating heart
In my beating heart
This minute will keep on keeping on
Decent beings
Good people
Dance around in their soul
Hey, hop my soil
I'll never forget the cradle I wаs born
Oh, hey, my beloved world
Continue to shine, shine, ѕhine…
