Shh

I've got golden locks and eyes so captivating
I am famous for my beauty, who am I (Shh)
I've been told I'm a little overconfident
And this will be my downfall, who am I (Shh)

I fell in deep
I lost my heartbeat
Stuck in between
The heaven and hell in me
I fell in deep
I lost my heartbeat
Follow the bloodstream

Hush, hush
If you know my name then please don't repeat it
Hush, hush
If you know my name then keep it a secret

In the ground
In the sky
In the afterlife
In the dark
In the light
In the sweet divine
Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush

My desire and my love got me in trouble
I'm decay and I'm revival, who am I (Shh)
Grabbed by jealousy and cheated by my enemy
From tears and blood to flowers, who am I?

I fell in deep
I lost my heartbeat
Stuck in between
The heaven and hell in me
I fell in deep
I lost my heartbeat
Follow the bloodstream

Hush, hush
If you know my name then please don't repeat it
Hush, hush
If you know my name then keep it a secret

In the ground
In the sky
In the afterlife
In the dark
In the light
In the sweet divine
Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush

(If you know my name)
(You should know my name)
(If you know my name)

Hush
(If you know my name)
(If you know my name)

In the ground
In the sky
In the afterlife
In the dаrk
In the light
In the sweet divine
Hush, hush, hush, huѕh
(Shh)
