Displaced

I'm counting down the days to myself
With my suitcase packed
Almost didn't fit
The accumulated 'saudade'
I can see the garden from the blue
Just behind the wing
Mom, look out the window
I'm coming home

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

No matter how it may seem
I'll never belong
To that city
The sea of people
The different sun
The pile of concrete
Doesn't provoke me
It doesn't feel like home

Because I
I came from far away
I came from the middle of the sea
In the heart of the ocean I have my whole life
I make my way thinking
Of returning
To my home, island, peace, Madeira
If I explain it to you word by word
You'll never understand the pain that silences me
The loneliness that haunts the moment of departure

I carry the peace of being able to return
Mom, look out the window, I'm coming

No matter how it may seem
I'll never belong
To that city
The sea of people
The different sun
The pile of concrete
Doesn't provoke me
It doesn't feel like

The seа of people
The different sun
The pile of concrete
Doesn't provoke me
It doeѕn't feel like home
