I'm Coming

(I'm coming)
Night falls, heart beats
You fall into a <span class="lyrics_mark" data-mark="yz6waw988w">trance</span>
Moon rises, earth arches
My gates open
(Hey)

I am Erika
Welcome
You're like a lovely
Trance god
Make yourself at home
Do what you want and
When you come
I'm coming with you

(I'm coming, I'm coming)
And before you come you scream
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
And I echo loudly: I'm coming
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
And we come together and we're like
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
This is what it's like to fall into a trance
(Wonderful)

I am Erika
Nice to meet you
And I'd even dance the wedding dance with you
But naked

I am Erika
You've got stamina
Hit on me again
Grab my buttock
And when you want some love again
Shout Encore
And baby I'm coming

(I'm coming, I'm coming)
And again when you come you scream
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
And I can't help but cry: I'm coming
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
And we come together and we're like
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
This is what it's like to fall into an otherwordly trance

Let go and let it happen
Baby give yourself and come with me
Stars in your eyes and me on top of you
Baby you deserve everything good here
Let go and let it happen
Baby you can still fall in love with yourself
Stars in your eyes and me on top of you
Baby you deserve everything good here

(I'm coming, I'm coming)
I'm coming
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
Falling in love
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
Hey baby
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
This is what it'ѕ like to fall into an otherwordly trаnce
