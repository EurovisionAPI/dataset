Milkshake Man

Come and take a sip from my special cup
I heard that you could use a little pick me up
What can get you high when you're oh so sad?
It's the milk from the milkshake man

(Ah-ah-ah)
Well I've got chocolate, vanilla, and lactose free
(Ah-ah-ah)
And a caramel banana, that you have got to see

You can call me the milkshake man
I wanna shake and make the whole world dance
They drink my milk all across the land
I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man

(Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)
I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man
(Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)
I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man

The shake is not a drink - it's a state of mind
Like a secret super power you were born to find
Drink it every day and before you know it
You'll be bigger… and stronger… with harder bones

(Ah-ah-ah)
Well I've got mango, mojito, a fruit ballet
(Ah-ah-ah)
And did you see the naughty special on my crème brûlée?

You can call me the milkshake man
I wanna shake up all the milk I can
They know my name all across the land
I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man

(Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)
I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man
(Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)
I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man

When I say sweet sweet, you say yum yum
Sweet, sweet (yum, yum)
Sweet, sweet (yum, yum)
When I say sweet sweet, you say yum yum
Sweet, sweet (yum, yum)
Sweet, sweet (yum, yum)

(Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)
I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man
(Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)
I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man
(Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)
I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man
