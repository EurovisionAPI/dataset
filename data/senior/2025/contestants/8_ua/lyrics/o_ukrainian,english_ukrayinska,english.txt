Bird of Pray

Zaide-zaidesh i do mene, moia ptashka
Krylamy pisnia zlitaie vazhka
Serden'ko, sertse kokhane, ne turbuisia
Dolia doviryla svit ostannim iz nas

Ya svitla shukaiu, hory zvernu
And I call you

Fly

I'm begging you
Begging you please just
Live
Share
My heart with someone who
Cares
Of
Me and my little bird of pray

Vertai-vertaisia dodomu, ridna stezhka
Spiv perelitnykh ptashok narodyt' vesnu
(I call you)

Where do you go
I'm begging you please just
