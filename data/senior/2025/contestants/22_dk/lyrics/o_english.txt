Hallucination

You show me more
More than meets the eye
You open all the doors inside my mind
I see colours I never saw before
A thousand shades of light come to life

Making me question all that I thought true
All that I'm seeing through you
My vision's blurry but I can see clearly
Baby, I'm losing control

You're my hallu-u-u
Hallucination
Hallu-u-u
Hallucination

I'm paranoid
Slipping from reality
You're leading me into another fantasy

Oh, making me question all that I thought true
All that I'm seeing through you
My vision is blurry but I can see clearly
Maybe I'm losing control

You're my hallu-u-u
Hallucination
Hallu-u-u
Hallucination
A new-ew-ew
Revelation
Hallu-u-u
Hallucination

Worlds are changing
Darkness fading
I follow you to the end and now I'm changing
(Now I'm changing)
It's a new sensation

(Worlds are changing)
(Darkness fading)
(My hallucination)
Hallucination
(Worlds are changing)
(Darknesѕ fading)
(My hallucination)

You're my hallu-u-u
Hallucination
Hallu-u-u
Hallucination

Hey yeah, yeah…
Hallucination

You're my hallu-u-u
Hallucination
Hallu-u-u
