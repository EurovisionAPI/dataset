Journey

My candid eyes discover the world
In a naive way that confounds
The demons of the night
Mmh, mmh
You throw words at me that choke me
No matter what
I'll lie next to you tonight
Mmh, mmh

One day you'll understand
That flowers are more beautiful
When you water them
You've cut me so many…

…times
If you want I'll go
With you on a journey
Go on a journey, journey
Go on a journey with you

Let me love you even if you don't
I'll drown in your tears
I'll share your melancholy
Mmh
You eat me up with your gaze
No matter what I'll never stop singing to you

You'll understand one day
That flowers are more beautiful
When you water them
You've cut me so many…

…timeѕ
If you want I'll go
With you on a journey
Go on a journey, journey
Go on a journey with you

Go on, go on a journey
Go on, go on a journey
Go on, go on a journey
With me

Go on, go on a journey
Go on, go on a journey
Go on, go on a journey
With me, with…

…me
If you want I'll go
With you on a journey
Go on a journey, journey
Go on а journey with you
