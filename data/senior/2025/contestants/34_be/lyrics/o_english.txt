Strobe Lights

Strobe lights, gettin' lost in your eyes
Cotton candy haze, we're floating up in space

Fallin' where up is down
Screamin', but won't make a sound
Alice, show me your hand
Take it to Wonderland

Step into the mirror to bright new dimensions
Where no words are needed to feel the connection
Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending
Come down through the looking glass

Strobe lights, gettin' lost in your eyes
Cotton candy haze, we're floating round in space
Skin tight, never felt so alive
Caught up in this maze
It's where I wanna stay

Flyin' deep underground
Silence never felt so loud

Step into the mirror to bright new dimensions
Where no words are needed to feel the connection
Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending
Come down through the looking glass

Strobe lights, gettin' lost in your eyes
Cotton candy haze, we're floating round in space
Skin tight, I feel so alive
Caught up in this maze
It's where I wanna stay

That's where I wanna stay
That's where I wanna ѕtаy
