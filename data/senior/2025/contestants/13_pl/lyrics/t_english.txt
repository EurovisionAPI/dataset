Gaia

(They call me Gaia)

You, who's been hurting me
And who has had my love for nothing
You marked me with your sins
And woke up the scream of loneliness within me

They call me Gaia
I'm the Goddess
I'm the strength
Love is my mother
The world is drowning in my tears
When I cry
Nestling in my arms the missing time

Gaia…
I'm gaia…
Time…
I'm gaia…

I'm the creator of your DNA
Your soul's destruction
And your salvation
The time is flowing in your bloodstream
The Holy Water is cleansing your fate

They call me Gaia
I'm the love
I'm the life of all imagined
The world drowns as it watches me cry
I'll be holding it close in my armѕ

They call me Gaia
Time
Time
