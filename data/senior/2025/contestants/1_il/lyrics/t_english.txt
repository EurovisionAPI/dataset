New Day Will Rise

And even if you say goodbye
You'll never go away
You are the rainbow of my sky
My colors in the grey
My only wish upon a star
Sunshine in the day
The only song that my piano ever plays

And even if you say goodbye
You'll always be around
To lift me up and take me high
Keep my feet close to the ground
Are you proud of me tonight
Dreams are coming true
I choose the light
Nothing to lose if I lose you

New day will rise
Life will go on
Everyone cries
Don't cry alone
Darkness will fade
All the pain will go by
But we will stay
Even if you say goodbye

And even if you say goodbye
You will never leave
You are the rainbow in my blue sky
My colours in the grey
And my only hope underneath a sky of art
A ray of sun in my day
The only song that my piano can play

New day will rise
Life will go on
Everyone cries
Don't cry alone
Darkness will fade
All the pain will go by
But we will stay
Even if you say

New day will rise
Life will go on
Everyone cries
Don't cry alone
Darkness will fade
All the pain will go by
But you will stay
The love of my life
