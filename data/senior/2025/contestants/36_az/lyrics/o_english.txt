Run With U

Rhythm pulls me out
Don't know where to start
You electrify
Never felt so high
Every glance you're giving
Every move, I'm feeling
I cannot resist
Pure in every twist

Shall we dim the lights
Leave our fears behind?
Play wrong till it's right
Give it all tonight
Heartbeat takes control
Moves my body and soul
Just one look at me
And I can't stand the heat

Shadows in the neon light
The night is young, the beat is tight
Something in the air that makes me fall for you
The way I do, aha
Way I do aha
Way I do aha
Way I do aha

No matter what you do tonight
I wanna run with U
I wanna run with U
No matter what you do tonight
I wanna run with U
I wanna run with U

(Running)
(With me)
(Running)
(Let's go)

Shooting to the stars
Can't get enough, so far
You make me feel brand new
Never felt this true
Every laugh you're giving
Every touch I'm living
And I can't pull away
Caught up in the play

Shall we dim the lights
Leave our fears behind?
Play wrong till it'ѕ right
Give it all tonight

Way I do aha
Way I do aha
Way I do aha
Way I do aha

No matter what you do tonight
I wanna run with U
I wanna run with U
No matter what you do tonight
I wanna run with U
I wannа run with U
