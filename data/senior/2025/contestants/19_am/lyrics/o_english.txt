Survivor

Survivor

I got my bad shades on
Jet-black am in ma zone
I'm sick of the news
I'm sick of the views
I'm sick of the lies they've told

Come on and shine the light
Come on and shine on me
Guess you can see
I don't believe
Anything they told me

Letting me down
Lifting me up
Keeping me slow
But I can't stop
It's tearing me apart
I'm alive
Tryna look up, atop of a rock
Climbing these heights, man
I can't stop at all
I'm standing tall

I'm a survivor
Stay aliver
Do or die in my prime
I'm a fighter
I'm a survivor
Won't be tied up
Break from the pain
Take your place, I'll remind ya

I'm a survivor

Break from the pain
Take your place, I'll remind ya

Kicking me, breaking me
But I won't stop
Pushing me, pulling me
I will get up
Hitting me, mocking me
Stabbing me, crushing me
Tearing me, burning me
I'll never stop

I could have lost my way
I could have made mistakes
I bled a lot, more than you thought
But I didn't fade away

Say you'll break me down
And bring me to my knees
You can do it
Can you prove it?
But you ain't got shit on me

I'm a survivor
Break from the pain
Take your place, I'll remind ya

Ոչ ոք մարել չի կարող</span>
Breathe in breathe out it's all done
Never forget who you are

I'm a survivor
Stay aliver
Do or die in my prime
I'm a fighter
I'm a survivor
Won't be tied up
Break from the pain
Take your place, I'll remind ya

I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor

Break from the pain
Take your place
Survivor
Break from the pain
Take your place
Survivor
Break from the pain
Take your place
