Lighter

Golden girl dressed in ice
A heart as dark as night
You got me to dim my light, no more
I really think I bought your lies
Did anything to keep you mine
You kept me hooked on your line, no more

Somewhere along the way I lost my mind
I had to walk a hundred thousand miles
I'm not afraid to set it all on fire
I won't fall again
I'll be my own lighter

Nothing can burn me now
I'll be my own lighter
I feel a spark inside me
I don't need saving
No way, no way
'Cause I'm my own
I'm my own lighter

I'm tired of a million tries to fight, the signs
And when everybody tried to tell me
I should've known that it was time to break free
Your reigns that kept me at your mercy
I'll burn them to the ground
No more, no more
Ignite the fire

Somewhere along the way I lost my mind
I had to walk a hundred thousand miles
I'm not afraid to set it all on fire
I won't fall again
I'll be my own lighter

Nothing can burn me now
I'll be my own lighter
I feel a spark inside me
I don't need saving
No way, no way
'Cause I'm my own
I'm my own lighter

Silence fills the room
And I've taken off my jewels
I wish none of this was true
But there's a fire growing too

Nothing can burn me now
I'll be my own lighter
I feel a spark inside me
I don't need saving
No way, no way
'Cauѕe I'm my own
I'm my own lighter

Nothing cаn burn me down
I'm my own
I'm my own lighter
