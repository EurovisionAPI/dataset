Freedom

(Sun, sky)

Freedom

(<span class="lyrics_mark" data-mark="2yd4n889k3">A and B, G and D</span>
Years are passing, time is flying
<span class="lyrics_mark" data-mark="2yd4n889k3">E and V, Z and T</span>
We will never give up this sky and mountains)

Like the scent of grass
The dew of the sky, the pure spring
The thirst for freedom
Carried in the heart by the homeland

And just like this heart in my chest
Freedom is also within me
And just like our life
The homeland is the one and only

This sun warms and shines today
On the mountains and fields of the homeland
With hope, we follow the roads
This sky, blue and cloudless sky
A peaceful and restless sea
I don't want any other wealth

Freedom is the heaven's gift we share
Freedom is the human wealth to care
Freedom is the mountain spring fresh air
People, let it be here and there, everywhere

I'm living my life with my smile
Kindness is sense of my style
Freedom's what makes life so mine
Home my sweet and marvelous home
Meadows and mountains to roam
This iѕ my wealth and my throne

Heaven, freedom, A аnd B
