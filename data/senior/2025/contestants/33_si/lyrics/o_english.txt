How Much Time Do We Have Left

Our baby boy
Was crawling in the living room
You read a diagnosis
It said that you'd be dying soon
It was a sunny day
Through the window
There were people going on their ways
Our little child had the biggest smile
While we couldn't do nothing but cry

How much time do we have left together
We never know
All I know is I don't want to be here
Without your love
How much time do we have left together
We never know
We never know
Wish we could take it slow

A man in white
With a room full of diplomas
Trying to get it right
Could put you under hypnosis
By saying to give up the fight
But you were always determined to try

How much time do we have left together
We never know
All I know is I don't want to be here
Without your love
How much time do we have left together
We never know
We never know
But we keep standing strong

I admire your power
I admire your will
You made me question the world
You made me question what's real
I admire your power
I admire your will
Your ability to heal

I admire your power
I admire your will
The way you never gave up
Until you grew wings
And you learned how to fly
Made a loop in the sky
You landed right into my arms

How much time do we have left together
We never know
All I know is I don't want to be here
(Without your love)
How much time do we have left together
We never know
We never know
Wish we could tаke it ѕlow
