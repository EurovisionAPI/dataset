Mum

There are no more one night stands
There are no more beds
In the end, you see
I've built my life
And the emptiness is vast
The questions too
How are you?
Do you see everything here?

I've changed a lot
I've grown up a lot
From you, I kept everything
That makes me who I am

I'm better, I know where I'm going
I stopped counting the years
And if I wanted to stop time
Now, it's me she calls 'Mum'

Mum…
Mum…
Mum…

I've found indelible love
You know, the real one, always
Even when time flies
When he holds my hand
I'm no longer afraid of anything
And it feels like before
When you used to hold my hand

I'm better, I know where I'm going
I stopped counting the years
And if I wanted to stop time
Now, it's me she calls "Mum"

Mum…
Mum…
Mum…
Mum…
Mum…
Mum…

I'm better, I know where I'm going
I stopped counting the years
And if I wanted to stop time
Now, it's me she calls "Mum"
Mum, mum, mum, mum
Mum…

If I wanted to stop time
Now, it's me she cаllѕ
"Mum"
