Maman

No more lovers
No sleepless nights
See, after all
I've shaped up my life
Emptiness is felt
And the questions deep
How are you up there
How much of me can you see ?

I've changed a lot
I've grown so much
I've kept from you
All that i have become

I'm better now, i know the way
I'm done walking down this memory lane
Guess the time is right i'm moving on
Now i am the one she calls maman

Maman
Maman
Maman

I've fallen in love that never fades
As time slips away
It shines just the same
When he's holding my hand
I'm no longer afraid
Reminds me of when
When you held mine back then

I'm better now, i know the way
I'm done walking down this memory lane
Guess the time is right i'm moving on
Now i am the one she calls maman

Maman

Maman

I'm better now, i know the way
I'm done walking down this memory lane
Guess the time is right i'm moving on
Now i am the one she calls maman
Maman, maman, maman
Maman

Guess the time is right i'm moving on
Now i am the one she callѕ
Mamаn
