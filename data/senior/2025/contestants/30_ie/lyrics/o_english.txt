Laika Party

(Ready for take off)

You have probably heard
About this brave little girl
All we know is that she saved the world
She got sent away
But she wasn't afraid
Though she was alone
In the dark big space

Left the cheering crowd
Went above the clouds
Rocket going high
Then they said good bye
She still wonders why
But she loves to fly

I hope Laika never died
And that she spins around us still
And that she has a party in the air and always will
I hope that she is dancing every night among the stars
I hope Laika is alive
Laika party in the sky
Laika party in the sky

Through the comets and the stones
She is howling for her bones
Singing along to the stars and sun
And if she didn't fly, nor would you and I
A forever hero for humankind

Left the cheering crowd
Went above the clouds
Rocket going high
Then they said good bye
She still wonders why
But she loves to fly

I hope Laika never died
And that she spins around us still
And that she has a party in the air and always will
I hope that she is dancing every night among the stars
I hope Laika is alive
Laika party in the sky
Laika party in the sky

Laika party in the sky
Laika party in the sky
Laika pаrty in the ѕky
