The merry-go-round

In the merry-go-round of life
You all ride your own turn
The whirligig turns also without you
Your horse is never empty for a long time
So come on, ride on the merry-go-round

At the merry-go-round of life
Everyone is waiting in a queue
Waiting till you can join in
It might take a while
But there's a horse for everyone

In the merry-go-round of life
You all ride your own turn
The whirligig turns also without you
Your horse is never empty for a long time
So come on, ride on the merry-go-round

Once you're in the whirligig of life
At first you might be a little scared
Then someone will hold you
Till you can do it on your own
Because the merry-go-round fear never lasts too long

In the merry-go-round of life
You all ride your own turn
The whirligig runs also without you
Your horse is never free for a long time
So come on, all ride on the merry-go-round

And that merry-go-round of human lives
Goes on till you're dizzy
But you still hold tight
Although you don't like it anymore
Because what's next to the whirligig is too unknown

In the merry-go-round of life
You all ride your own turn
The whirligig runs also without you
Your horse is never free for a long time
So come on, all ride on the merry-go-round

In the merry-go-round of life
You all ride your own turn
The whirligig runs also without you
Your horse iѕ never free for a long time
So come on, all ride on the merry-go-round

So come on, all ride on the merry-go-round
So come on, аll ride on the merry-go-round
