Swiss lady

She was rather slim, she was slim like a twig
And sometimes he took her out of his closet
There he played music and put his hand tenderly around her

He played rock 'n' roll, he played Dixieland
And was known as the One Main Mountain Band
He said: "the world is full of music all thanks to her"
"She gives me everything and doesn't forget me"

She's my Swiss lady
And I, a man from the mountains
And if you've ever heard her
You'll know exactly what I mean

Yes, she's my Swiss lady
And I, a man from the mountains
And if you've ever heard her
You'll know how beautiful an alphorn sounds

Yahoo-oo-ooh
Yahoo-oo-ooh

Aooh… Swiss lady
Aooh… Swiss lady
Aooh

When he came home, he took her by the arm
Where he lovingly took her apart
But before that, he played in Dixie style one more time

And in the deep of the night, the people woke up
And complained, then he just laughed
He said: "I'm inviting you and let's celebrate"
"Because my lady doesn't want to sleep yet"

She's my Swiss lady
And I, a man from the mountains
And if you've ever heard her
You'll know exactly what I mean

Yes, she's my Swiss lady
And I, a man from the mountains
And if you've ever heard her
You'll know how beautiful an alphorn sounds

Yahoo-oo-ooh
Yahoo-oo-ooh

Aooh… Swiss lady
Aooh… Swiss lady
Aooh

She's my Swiss lady
And I, a man from the mountains
And if you've ever heard her
You'll know exactly what I mean

Yes, she's my Swiss lady
And I, a man from the mountains
And if you've ever heard her
You'll know how beautiful an аlphorn soundѕ
