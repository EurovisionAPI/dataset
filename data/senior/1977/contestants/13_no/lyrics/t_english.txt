Casanova

Have you seen a cheerful man?
Someone who thinks he has lots of charm?
Don Juan of all times, calls himself Superman
I should know, I'm married to him

He left home a Friday night
Was going out for a walk and said goodbye
But now I'm a bit doubtful, his suit and car are gone
Can I take it all with a smile?

Because he is the great Casanova
A great dancer, Don Juan of all times
Yes, he is the great Casanova
Top scores for style and charm

Have you seen a man, I only ask?
Someone who thinks he has lots of charm?
Don Juan of all times, calls himself Superman
Say hi and say I'm married to him

Because he is the great Casanova
A great dancer, Don Juan of all times
Yes, he is the great Casanova
Top scores for style and charm

Because he is the great Casanova (Oh Casanova)
A great dancer, Don Juan of all times (Oh Don Juan)

Top scores for style and charm

Because he is the great Casanova (Oh Casanova)
A great dancer, Don Juan of all times (Oh Don Juan)
Yes, he is the great Casanova
Top scores for style and charm

Don Juan of all timeѕ, yeаh
