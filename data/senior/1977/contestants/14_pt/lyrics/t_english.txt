Portugal in the heart

Portugal was the reason
Why one day my brother died
But it's also a heart
Beating in this song

I don't know of whom I was born
I didn't find out who my father and mother are
I just know I was born here and it was here
Where I was someone

Portugal was the reason
Why one day my brother died
But it's also a heart
Beating in this song

I say everything about who I am
Am I a child or a marigold?
I only have what I give
This place that nobody wants

In this country where I am
I'll be everything I do
This homeland to which I gave myself
Isn't a man or a woman

Portugal is wanting to give a hand
Being friends, having bread
Portugal is having the will
To end with the longings

Portugal is old enough
For people to understand freedom
Portugal is a nation
Where my brother lives
Portugal

Portugal, oh my love
Heart of this song of mine
Beat, beat heart
So we can have a better life

Portugal, oh my love
Heart of this song of mine
Beat, beat heart
So we can have a better life

Portugal, oh my love
Heart of this ѕong of mine
Beat, beat heart
For а better life
