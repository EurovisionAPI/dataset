The Beatles

The Beatles gave us all their songs
"Yesterday's" a lovely one
Like all the others they have done
Yeah, yeah, yeah

The Beatles' songs we knew by heart
In music they could work it out
Ooh, we loved to hear them shout
Yeah, yeah, yeah

All the kids were humming on
"A Hard Day's Night" just all along
Grandma said, they're not bad
Go ahead – Beatles, Beatles

The world turned out to be a stage
Their songs were loved by any age
In music did they turn the page
Yeah, yeah, yeah

The Beatles gave us all their songs
At sixty-four they'll sing along
Thanks for all the things you are
We'll remember Ringo Starr
And George and Paul and John
