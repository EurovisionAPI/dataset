Beatles

The Beatles gave us their music
'Yesterday', how nice it was
Everybody loved the melody
Yeah yeah yeah…

When records were released there was a commotion
The gramophone played non-stop
Everybody fell for the charm of the Beatles
Yeah yeah yeah…

A lot of people went around humming
"A Hard Day's Night", although they were small
Your great grandfather can tell you who they were
The Beatles, The Beatles

The world was a big stage
And there we stood in rows
Enjoying every nice ballad
Yeah yeah yeah…

The Beatles gave us their music
Girls were screaming and shouting
We still have all the records
We shall remember Ringo Starr
And George and Paul and John
