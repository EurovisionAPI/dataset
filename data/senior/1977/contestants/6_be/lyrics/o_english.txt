A Million in One, Two, Three

Need a million in one, two, three
Can't you do a little work for me?
Mister President, can't you see?
I'm never gonna get higher

Need a million in one, two, three
I'm not too clumsy, as you can see
I've got the feeling inside of me
Feel my need and desire now

I've got the look, but never got the money
Just a ten quid flat on the second floor
Too doo doo too too too doo…
Had a dream: holiday in Cannes
A yacht in Monte Carlo next to his
Too doo doo too too too doo…

Joining your big company
Could bring me wealth and sympathy
Think you've got some extra needs?
Hey, hey, hey…

Need a million in one, two, three

Need a million in one, two, three
I'm not too clumsy, as you can see
I've got the feeling inside of me
Feel my need and desire now

My bedroom wall's covered with glamour
The Lido in December would not be bad
Too doo doo too too too doo…
Ships and sails, Formula races
Super-long drinks down at the Playboy club
Too doo doo too too too doo…
