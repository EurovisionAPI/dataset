Love is a song for two

Yes, yes, it's playing again
An old refrain
The was rewritten especially for you
I shall sing it to you

And violins reply again
Even I am like a string
That was meant for one tune
Your tune

The heavens will sing
Love is a song for two
The whole world laughs with me and sings
How nice it is, how nice it is

The heavens will sing
Love is a song for two
For my song is your song

Yes, yes, it's playing again
An old refrain
That we will sing today in a duet
We will sing in a duet

For the song is not over
It will always be sung
Always

(The heavens will sing)
(Love is a song for two)
The whole world laughs with me and sings
How nice it is, how nice it is

(The heavens will sing)
It is rising and thumping
Like drums in the heart
(Love is a song for two)
With this tune

The whole world laughs with me and sings
How nice it is, how nice it is

The heavens will sing
Love is а song for two
For your song is my ѕong
