Free

Free to talk, free to seak
To do and to undo, just to be myself

Free to understand, free to feel
To reach a goal, and to make a mistake myself

I know well what I want, what I don't want
I have my pride, you don't even come into it

Find myself in love, but not bound to you
A woman who is used to walk on her own

(Free to think, free to show)
To think… free to show
(To give and not to give)
What you like

Free to try, free to be mother
To sin or not to sin and to pay for it myself

Free as the sun, free as the sea
Us, as two individuals, free, you and me

(Free as the sun, free as the sea)
As the sun…
(Us, as two individuals, free, you and me)
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na …

(Free as the sun, free as the sea)
As the sea…
(Us, as two individuals)
Free, you and me

(Free as the sun, free as the sea)
Like the sea
(Us, as two individuals)
Free, you and me

(Free as the sun, free as the sea)
Na na na na na na na… na na na… as the sea…
(Us, as two individualѕ, free, you and me)
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na…

Free, you аnd me
