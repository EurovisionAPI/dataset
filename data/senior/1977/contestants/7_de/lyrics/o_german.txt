Since you're gone I'm all alone – Stop
Just can't make it on my own – Stop
Operator, did you get the line?
Rush a cable, for I've got no time

Gotta send a telegram, telegram to my baby
Yes, I'm gonna send a telegram, telegram, and then maybe
He won't keep me yearnin'
Tonight he'll be on his way, tomorrow he'll be here to stay
Help me, ma'am, I can't wait another day

Please forgive the things I said – Stop
Didn't mean to make you sad – Stop
Operator, I'll pay any rate
If my message will not be too late

Gotta send a telegram, telegram to my baby
Yes, I'm gonna send a telegram, telegram, and then maybe
He won't keep me yearnin'
Tonight he'll be on his way, tomorrow he'll be here to stay
Help me, ma'am, I can't wait another day

I was such a fool to let him go
Too proud to show that I love him so

Gotta send a telegram, telegram to my baby
Yes, I'm gonna send a telegram, telegram, and then maybe
He won't keep me yearnin'
Tonight he'll be on his way, tomorrow he'll be here to stay
Help me, ma'am, gotta ѕend a telegrаm
