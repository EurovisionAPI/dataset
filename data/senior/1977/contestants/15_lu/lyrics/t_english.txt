Brother John

(Brother John, Brother John)
(Are you sleeping? Are you sleeping?)
Brother John, Brother John
Wake up, wake up

There is so much better to do
Than playing my big brother
I'm not a child anymore, you know
My little body has grown
And I enrage to be a good girl
When your friends want to kiss me

Peter - I'm scared, Harry - I laugh
Pablo, Tino, Pedro - zero
Simon - oh no, William - what a drama
I shout, I bite and you sleep
Harold passes very close to me, and Pierre tightens me
Eric, Patrick - it's the panic
Brother John, save me

(Brother John) In my dreams
(Brother John) You take me with you
(Are you sleeping?) In my night
(Are you sleeping?) You flee me

Without you, I'd become a nun
I can hear the bells ringing
It's my heartbeat when I wait for you
I've put some red on my lips
And perfume on my fever
But most of all, don't sleep too long

Mmm… mmm…

(Brother John) Brother John
(Brother John) Brother John
(Are you sleeping?) Wake up
(Are you sleeping?) Wake up

(Brother John) Brother John
(Brother John) Brother John
Wake up, аnd come ѕleep with me
