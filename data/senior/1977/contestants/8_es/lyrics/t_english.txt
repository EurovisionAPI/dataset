Teach me to sing

When I left my house for a walk
Thinking of my problems that I want to forget
I found a girl sitting at my door
Playing a banjo, singing without stopping

Teach me to sing, teach me to sing
That my heart is sad and that I need to love
Teach me to sing, teach me to sing
That my heart is sad and that I need to love

(La lala lala lalala…)
(La lala lala lalala…)
(La lala lala lalala…)
(La lala…)

La lala lala lalala…
La lala lala lalala…
La lala lala lalala…
La lala…

I looked at her smile, and without knowing why
Her face illuminated and she smiled as well
"Sit by my side if you want to learn
And don't be ashamed, I'll show you"

Teach me to sing, teach me to sing
That my heart is sad and that I need to love
Teach me to sing, teach me to sing
That my heart is sad and that I need to love

(La lala lala lalala…)
(La lala lala lalala…)
(La lala lala lalala…)
(La lala…)

La lala lala lalala…
La lala lala lalala…
La lala lala lalala…
La lala…

Teach me to sing, teach me to sing
That my heart is sad and I need to love

Teach me to sing, teach me to sing
That my heart is sad and that I need to love
Teach me to sing, teach me to sing
That my heart is sad and that I need to love

Teach me to sing, teach me to sing
That my heart is sad and that I need to love
Teach me to sing, teаch me to ѕing
