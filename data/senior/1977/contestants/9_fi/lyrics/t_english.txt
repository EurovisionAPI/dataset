Lapponia

Manana…
Mana nana mana na…
Mana nana mana…
Mananana nina nana…

Lapponia, this is Lapponia
From where the call of the beautiful northern girl echoes

That girl is a witch
She creates with the power of destiny
She's without company and consolation
And that's why she conjures witching
She creates with the power of spells
In the way of Seita she can beckon a man

Hey… manana…
Mana nana mana na…
Mana nana mana…
Mananana nina nana…

Lapponia, this is Lapponia
From where the call of the beautiful northern girl echoes

A man left to the north
The road goes by listening to his instincts
The man falls in love with the witch
He is a human being of Earth
And that's why the witch must go away
She's the witch who flies
She goes with the fire of the sky and the spells echo

Hey… manana…
Mana nana mana na…
Mana nana mana…
Mananana nina nana…

Lapponia, this is Lapponia
From where the call of the beautiful northern girl echoes
So sounds the calling song of the shaman:
Mananana…

Ma… (Ma nanana nana nanana…)
(Ma nananana nana nanana…)
Ooh… (Ma nanana nana nanana…)
(Ma nananana nana nanana…)

(Lapponia, Lapponia, Lapponia, Lapponia)

(Manana…)
(Mana nana manana…)
(Mana nana mana…)
(Ma nana nanana…)

Lapponia, this is Lapponia
From where the call of the beautiful northern girl echoes
Lapponia, this is Lapponia
From where the call of the beautiful northern girl echoeѕ

(Manana…)
(Mana nana manana…)
(Mana nana mа…)
