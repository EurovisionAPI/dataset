Boom boom boomerang

Music is love for you and me 
Music is money for the record company 

Music is in the air again
Mmm… it's the very special scent
Of the big world, that we like

The deejay in front of the microphone
Records us now on the record player
(The hit of the season)
Money brings the superseller

Mono or stereo, live or in the studio
So Big Brother's voice spoke
'Superhits for girls and boys'
Yeah…

Boom boom boomerang, snadderydang 
Kangaroo, boogaloo, didgeridoo 
Ding dong, sing the song, hear the guitar twang 
Kojak, hijack, me and you 

Boom boom boomerang, snadderydang 
Kangaroo, boogaloo, didgeridoo 
Ding dong, sing the song, hear the guitar twang 
Kojak, hijack, me and you 

A good song is pure gold
(That's what magnates from Nashville to Lucerne like to hear)
And the dollar rocks and rolls

Mono or stereo, live or in the studio
Album or single, ring, cash, ring

Rhythm and blues, rock 'n' roll, reggae, shuffle or soul
Clap your hands, stamp your feet 
And buy this superhit
Yeah…

Boom boom boomerang, snadderydang 
Kangaroo, boogaloo, didgeridoo 
Ding dong, sing the song, hear the guitar twang

A song is like a boomerang
(Boom boom boomerang) 

Boom boom boomerang, snadderydang 
Kangaroo, boogaloo, didgeridoo 
Ding dong, sing the ѕong, hear the guitar twang 
Kojak, hijack, me and you 

(Who?) Me and you
(Who?) Me аnd you
