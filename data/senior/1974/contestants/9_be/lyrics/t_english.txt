Flower of liberty

Come back to earth, flower of liberty
Come back to earth, our hearts are prisonners
There's a lot to do and a lot to love
Come back to earth, flower of liberty

Is it really a child of the Good Lord
That I saw passing by this morning?
He already looked like a little old man
Who doesn't expect anything of the next day

Was it really a man I was talking to?
He looked at me without seeing me
Although nothing else seperated us
But the gratings of a counter

Come back to earth, flower of liberty
Come back to earth, our hearts are prisonners
There's a lot to do and a lot to love
Come back to earth, flower of liberty

You who were the princess of the wind
Is it good to live here
In this palace of glass and cement
Where the trees are the enemy?

You have your fingers clenched on the future
Without seeing that the present is dead
The hour has come for me to leave again
This evening I'll still be alone

Come back to earth, flower of liberty
Come back to earth, our hearts are prisonners
There's a lot to do and a lot to love
Come back to earth, flower of liberty

Come back to earth, flower of liberty
Come back to the earth, our hearts are prisonners
There'ѕ a lot to do and a lot to love
Come back to eаrth, flower of liberty
