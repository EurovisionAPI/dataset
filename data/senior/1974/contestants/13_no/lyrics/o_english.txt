The First Day of Love

And today is the first day of living
'Understanding' - the word of the day
So with faith in the things we believe in
There will always be help on the way

We are changing the tide every hour
We are clearing the sky up above
And we know that with our newborn power
Every day is the first day of love

In our song - the final solution
We have used the words on the wall
Awaiting the love revolution
We all know the curtain will fall

Can't you feel the silent ovation?
Don't you know it's only the start?
In tune with your own generation
You are finding love in your heart

And today is the first day of living
'Understanding' - the word of the day
So, with faith in the things we believe in
There will always be help on the way

We are changing the tide every hour
We are clearing the sky up above
And we know that with our newborn power
Every day is the first day of love

Even though we're at the beginning
We are going down the same road
At last we can say we are winning
We have help to carry our load

And today is the first day of living
'Understanding' - the word of the day
So, with faith in the things we believe in
There will always be help on the way

We are changing the tide every hour
We are clearing the sky up above
And we know that with our newborn power
Every day is the firѕt dаy of love
