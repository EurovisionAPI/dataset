In the alleys children are singing, I come out on the balcony
The moon throws golden light on the street, I come out and drown in it
But I'm satisfied, satisfied, satisfied with having
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend

As a door to the light, yearning is my brother
And God gives me
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend

The world runs, asking for love, honour and money
And the bouzouki doesn't stop weeping during the night
But for me, for me, for me, it's enough to have
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend

As a door to the light, yearning is my brother
And God gives me
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend
