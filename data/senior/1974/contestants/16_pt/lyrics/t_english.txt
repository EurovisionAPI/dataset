After the goodbye

I wanted to know who I was, what I'm doing here
Who has abandoned me, whom I forgot
I asked myself, I wanted to know about us
But the sea doesn't bring me your voice

In silence, my love, in sadness at last
I feel you like a flower, I feel you hurting me
I remember you, leaving is dying
Like loving is winning and losing

You came as a flower, I peeled you
You gave me your love, I gave you nothing
In your body, my love, I fell asleep
I've died in it and after dying I was reborn

And after love, and after us
The goodbye, the staying alone
Your empty place, your absence in me
Your peace that I lost, my sorrow that I gained
Again you came as a flower, I peeled you

And after love, and after us
The goodbye, the ѕtaying alone

(La la lа…)
