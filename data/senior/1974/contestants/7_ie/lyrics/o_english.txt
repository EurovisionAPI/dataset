Cross Your Heart

La lala lala… la lala lala… la lala lala la…

Cross your heart, say: "I love you"
Cross your heart and hope to die
For a very simple reason
And here's the reason why:
For so many hearts are broken by one little lie
Cross your heart and hope to die

Sticks and stones wouldn't break my bones
Though it happened again and again
But I came smilling through, don't ask me how
Playing at games and calling me names
Never worried me then
But it's a different game we're playing now

Cross your heart, say: "I love you"
Cross your heart and hope to die
For a very simple reason
And here's the reason why:
For so many hearts are broken by one little lie
Cross your heart and hope to die

It wasn't easy to get up, believe me
To get up again and again
Each time they knocked me down, it hurt a lot
Love's got to show now
There's nowhere to go now
This is the end of the line
Because I'm giving this all I've got

Cross your heart, say: "I love you"
Cross your heart and hope to die
For a very simple reason
And here's the reason why:
For so many hearts are broken by one little lie
Cross your heart and hope to die

Lalala la lalala… lalala la lala…
Lalala la lalala…
And here's the reason why:
For so many hearts are broken by one little lie
Crosѕ your heart and hope to die

La lala lala… la lala lala… la lala lala lala…
Lalala la lala lala… la lala lala… la lala lala lala…
Lalala la lala lala… la lala lala… la lala lala lа…
