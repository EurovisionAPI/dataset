The one who stays and the one who leaves

At the end of a love affair, the one who stays is the loser
The one who leaves already knows somebody is waiting
At the end of a love affair, at the moment of the last glance
There's always, always on earth somewhere

The one who stays and the one who leaves
The one who talks and the one who doesn't dare
The one who cries, the one who lowers his eyes
There's always, always a moment of farewell

The one who stays and the one who leaves
The one who cheats and the one who doesn't know it
The one who very soon is to be forgotten
And the other who will stay alone all his life
All his life

Of course I understand you, things had to happen this way
You have the power to leave, I don't have it
Of course I understand, of course I'm not mad at you
But lo and behold, 'we' already became 'you and me'

The one who stays and the one who leaves
The one who talks and the one who doesn't dare
The one who cries, the one who lowers his eyes
There's always, always a moment of farewell

The one who stays and the one who leaves
The one who cheats and the one who doesn't know it
The one who very soon is to be forgotten
And the other who will stay alone all his life
