Älä mene pois (Keep Me Warm)

Oh my friend, stay a little while
Something's happening to our lives
By the time it's summer
Frightened minds are winter

I will free from their icy spell
Bring you fragrance from nature's well
I'll soothe away your worries
Show you how my love is
Say you'll stay and keep me warm

I need you - it's simple to say
I need you, I must be certain
If you go away, you know there's nothing for me

Oh my friend, stay and sit with me
The nights ahead could be warm and free
The morning winds I give you
I won't disappoint you
Say you'll stay and keep me warm

I need you - it's simple to say
I need you, I must be certain
If you go away, you know there's nothing for me

Oh my friend, when the summer comes
We'll be younger, we'll have our fun
I'll soothe away your worries
Show you how my love is
Say you'll stay and keep me warm

Say you'll ѕtay and keep me warm
Stay and keep me warm
Stay and keep me wаrm
