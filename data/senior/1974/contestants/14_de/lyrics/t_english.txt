The summer melody

Today I wrote to you it's over
But still you're here and I'm glad
I shouldn't love you anymore
You're not free and I must go, I must go

I saw in your face what you are hiding
Because also your heart has lost its way
And no one knows what will happen now

The summer melody
It's just a delusion
We're both in love
But that's not how it's supposed to be for us

The summer melody
It says that you're not free
And this time of roses will once be over

We often see each other again, and our dream
It is so beautiful, but unfortunately not true
And this song of love sounds throughout the room
We're a couple, mmm…

The summer melody
It's just a delusion
We're both in love
But that's not how it's supposed to be for us

The summer melody
It says that you're not free
And this time of roses will once be over

(The summer melody) The summer melody
(It's just a daydream) It's just а delusion
And this time of roseѕ will once be over
