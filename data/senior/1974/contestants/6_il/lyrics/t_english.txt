I gave her my life

Back in the early days of history
When the world existed only in theory
And they didn't differentiate between tomorrow, the day before yesterdat and last night
There would fight where you should put the sun

But one thing was agreed upon
If the man is stubborn
No chance, no compensation
That is what happened

I gave her my life, I fell on my knees
Everyone will believe me
I learned what it was and was offended

Since then many bridges have passed over the water
And they've already had time to come up with noon
They still didn't know about the globe, what shape it was
If it's square, if it's round, or whatever he likes

But they knew one thing
And that was immediately determined
If she refused - there is no hope
That is what happened

I gave her my life, I fell on my knees
Everyone will believe me
I learned what it was and was offended

Today you will find that the topic for any debate is
What came first - the egg or the apple?
One says that the sky is running out for him
There is enough air for a country or two

Maybe we'll get along after all
She will want, then we will overcome
She denied any access
That's what happened when…

I gave her my life, I fell on my knees
Believe me, everyone, I learned what it is for nothing

I gave her my life, I fell on my knees
Believe me, everyone, I learned what it is for nothing

I gave her my life, I fell on my knees
Believe me, everyone, I learned what it iѕ for nothing

I gave her my life, I gave her my life
I gаve her my life
