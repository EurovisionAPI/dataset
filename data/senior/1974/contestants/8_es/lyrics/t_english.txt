Sing and be happy

Joy, if you want to have, sing the joy of living
To enjoy, sing, sing and be happy

If the song I sing doesn't fill you with joy
The more I tell you something (It's useless)
If you don't have someone who loves you
Or someone to say "I love you"
To search for love with money (It's useless)

If you're so intelligent that no one understands you
To get mad at people (It's useless)
If you can't lie in the sun and take a drink in peace
To say you're in Europe (It's useless)
It's useless, it's useless, it's useless

Sing to life if you want to have, sing
The joy of living
To enjoy, sing, sing and be happy
Sing with me to have, sing
The joy of living
To enjoy, sing, sing and be happy

If you have to drink wine to forget your sorrows
Don't do it my good friend (It's useless)
If you stop for a blond girl when you're on the motorway
But it appears to be a hitch-hiker (It's useless)
It's useless, it's useless, it's useless

Sing to life if you want to have, sing
The joy of living
To enjoy, sing, sing and be happy
Sing with me to have, sing
The joy of living
To enjoy, sing, sing and be happy

(Sing) Ay, if you want to have
(Sing) Joy, yes
(Sing) To enjoy
(Sing) Sing and be happy

Sing with me to have, sing
The joy of living
To enjoy, sing, sing and be happy

(Sing) If you want to have
(Sing) The joy of living
To enjoy, sing, sing and be happy

Sing and be happy, sing and be happy, sing аnd ѕing
