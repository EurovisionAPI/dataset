My call for you

Desire to the past
And the memory to our luck
Play a wild game with me
And every moment in time
I take them back from oblivion

My call for you
Will be a cry of love
That's why the wind sings the song of desire

My call for you
Will be like a sunbeam
That makes our love bloom again

Questions if my life's worthy
If it goes on without you
Days that are nothing but dreams
My life is an empty space
The reality is just a silhouette for me

My call for you
Will be a cry of love
That's why the wind sings the song of desire

My call for you
Will be like a sunbeam
That makes our love bloom again

Oh, my call for you
Will be a cry of love
That's why the wind sings the song of desire

My call for you
Will be like a sunbeam
That makes our love bloom again

That makeѕ our love bloom agаin
