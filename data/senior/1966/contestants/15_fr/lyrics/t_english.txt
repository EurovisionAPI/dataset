Where we live

Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live
Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live

It's a real luck that we've got to know each other
Since the last holidays that you came to us
Crossing the Atlantic Ocean, you classically had
Romantic ideas about our people

Because for a long time already, in the eyes of foreigners
Our old continent hasn't changed much
It's with the eternal manners
That in Europe boys pay court to girls

The fact remains that we love each other
And that we're even able
To get married without problem
The way it is done here

You wanted to take me there
In your city of birth
Where everything is big, too big, believe me
Where the walls never end

I really want to follow you, but I've read in books
That it's still better to live here

Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live
Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live

I prefer to big cities
The gentleness of a small village
In the public square during the summer evenings
We can have fun and dance

All those differences in both our lives
Have no importance for being happy here
In the street where I live, everybody invites you
To become very quickly aѕ а child of our own

Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live
Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live
