Don't you see?

Don't you see that nowadays I'm not a child anymore?
Don't you see that the years have passed?
Since then, my heart has also grown
And I love you more than a friend

Don't you see – each time you take my arm
Don't you see that I lean on you?
When you embrace me, I'm afraid one would say
That we are, you and me, brother and sister

People say that love is blind
But I think it's deaf like you
It's true that I'm all alone when I tell you that

Don't you see that I'm not a child anymore nowadays?
Don't you see that the years have passed?
Deep in me, love has grown too
And I love you much more than a friend

Don't you see – now that I have taken your arm
Don't you see that you lean on me?
The first step, I had to take it before you
And you love me since that day
And we love each other ѕince that dаy
