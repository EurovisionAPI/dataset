Much stronger

Much stronger than the wind
And bigger than the earth
Is your love for me
Is my love for you
Today and tomorrow and always

Much redder than blood
And harder than stone
Is your love for me
Is my love for you
Today and tomorrow, my love

So open your arms
Take me far from here
I want to live with you
And laugh with your mouth
And cry with your eyes
And sing and dance and know you happy

Fierier than the fire
And sweeter than the rain
Is your love for me
Is my love for you
Today and tomorrow and always

Much further than life
And beyond death
Is your love for me
Iѕ my love for you
Today аnd tomorrow, my love
My love, my love
