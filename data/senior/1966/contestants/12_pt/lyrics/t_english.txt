He and she

I know him
He's a good guy, a little bit shy
Spends his life dreaming about love
Because his heart asks for a little more heat

She came by
And her beauty caught him right away
They love each other, and now he says
He found life's greatest gift, happiness

He thinks of her all the time
Dreams of her all night long
Cries for her if she doesn't come

He keeps talking about her
She's all he can think of
He can't live without her

I know him
He's a good guy, a little bit shy
Spends his life dreaming about love

And her beauty caught him right away
They love each other, and now he says
He found life's greatest gift, happiness

He thinks of her all the time
Dreams of her all night long
Cries for her if she doesn't come

He keeps talking about her
She'ѕ all he can think of
He can't live without her
He can't live without her
He can't live without her, can't live, cаn't live
