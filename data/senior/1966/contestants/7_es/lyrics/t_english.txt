I'm that one

I'm that one
Who chases after you every night
I'm that one
Who doesn't live anymore because he loves you
The one who waits for you
The one who dreams of you
The one who wants to be the owner of your love
Of your love

I'm that one
Who gives his life to have you
I'm that one
Who's far away and doesn't forget you
The one who waits for you
The one who dreams of you
That one who every night prays for your love

And I'm here, here, to love you
I'm here, here, to adore you
I'm here, here to tell you
That nobody loved you like I did

I'm that one
Who gives his life to have you
I'm that one
Who being far away doesn't forget you
The one who waits for you
The one who dreams of you
That one who every night prayѕ for your love

And I'm here, here, to love you
I'm here, here, to аdore you
I'm here, here to tell you
Love, love, love, love
