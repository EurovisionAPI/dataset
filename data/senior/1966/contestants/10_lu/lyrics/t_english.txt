I waited for you tonight

The wind could be shaking the branches
On the street the shutters are shut
On a white table-cloth a few roses are leaning
On a cutlery set for two

The melody that you prefer
Put onto the piano board
Everything is ready, I hope, I have nothing more to do
But to open the door, 'cause I hear your steps
But there you are, but don't act as if you're surprised

'Cause I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight
I was so sure that you would come
Yes, I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight
I was right to expect you

We hurt each other a lot
We broke up for a few words
It's the old story, I know very well that you love me
That's why I was looking forward to your steps
And here I am, right in front of you, spreading out my arms

'Cause I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight
I was so sure that you would come
Yes, I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight
I was right to expect you

Yes, I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight
To keep you for evermore
Yeѕ, I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight
I wаited for you tonight
