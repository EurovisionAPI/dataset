Stop, while the going is good

When a girl's going home from her first dance
It happens that her friend, goes just a bit too far
Yes, that happens so often, but she answers back:

Stop, yes stop, yes stop, while the going is good
For I can feel, that you'll forget
That I should be home by two o'clock
What if, yes what if, yes what if the dreams would burst
For I think you can see
Time stops completely, when you hold so tight

Let's just aimlessly wander on
Enjoy the tranquillity of the starry sky, it was made for us

Come, yes come, yes come, perhaps I'll say yes
When the time has come for the puzzle of love
It will be without a 'stop'

Let's just aimlessly wander on
Enjoy the tranquillity of the starry sky, it was made for us

Come, yes come, yes come, perhaps I'll say yes
When the time has come for the puzzle of love
It will be without а 'ѕtop'
