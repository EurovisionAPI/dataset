My God, I love you so much

In the sky the clouds pass by
They're going towards the sea
Looking like white handkerchiefs
That greet our love

My God, I love you so much
It's not possible
To have so much happiness between your arms
Kissing your lips that smell like the wind
We're two lovers, like nobody in the world

My God, I love you so much
I feel like crying
In my whole life, I've never felt

Such a valuable happiness, such a true happiness
Who can stop the river that flows towards the sea?
The swallows in the sky that go towards the sun?
Who can change my love, my love for you?

My God, I love you so much

Such a valuable happiness, such a true happiness
Who can stop the river that flows towards the sea?
The swallows in the sky that go towards the sun?
Who can chаnge my love, my love for you?

My God, I love you so much
My God, I love you ѕo much
