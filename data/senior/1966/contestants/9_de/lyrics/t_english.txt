The hands of the clock

Sometimes you still read the old letters he wrote you
In which every line read: "I love you"
You close your eyes and dream of him
And of the lost happiness

Yet the hands of the clock only turn
Forwards, forwards and never backwards

You still have a lot of nice pictures from that time
You feel sorrow about those wonderful years
You close your eyes, dream of him
And of the lost happiness

Yet the hands of the clock only turn
Forwards, forwards and never backwards

You feel lonely and dream of yesterday
But you're living today
Someone will come along to free you from your dreams
You'll close your eyes
And then a new happiness will begin for you

Then the hands of the clock only turn
Forwards, forwards and never backwards

The hands of the clock only turn
Forwards, forwards and never backwаrdѕ
