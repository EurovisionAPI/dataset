Fernando & Philippo

Tong-ki tong ti-ki kong-kong-kong
Ri-ki kong-kong-kong ti-ki kong-kong
Ri kong-kong ti-ki kong-kong-kong
Ti-ki kong-kong-kong

Fernando, Fernando
Guitarist from Santiago
Plays the whole evening solo
And then still drives to San Antonio

Philippo, Philippo
Is totally different from Fernando
Really, he doesn't get into his car
And then still drives to San Antonio

But Fernando is longing so much for her
Even though he's tired, he takes his guitar
Gives his songs and his love as a present to her
In San Antonio

Fernando, Fernando
Guitarist from Santiago
Plays the whole evening solo
And then still drives to San Antonio

Tong-ki tong ti-ki tong-tong-tong
Ri-ki tong-tong-tong ti-ki kong-kong
Ri kong-tong ti-ki tong-tong-rong
Ti-ki tong-tong-tong

Fernando, Fernando
Guitarist from Santiago
Plays the whole evening solo
And then still drives to San Antonio

But once the dice were loaded against him
One night he couldn't find his girl anymore
She went to Philippo in the evening
Disappeared alone from San Antonio

Philippo, Philippo
Now says to Fernando in the evening:
"Just wait a while, because she'll be here soon"
"She'ѕ coming for me from Sаn Antonio"

Tong-ki tong ri-ki kong-kong-tong
Ti-ki kong-kong-kong ti-ki kong-kong
Ri kong-kong ti-ki kong-kong-kong
Ti-ki kong-kong-kong
