A Man Without Love

A man without love is only half a man
And half a man is nothing
A man without love cannot begin to dream
For all his dreams lead nowhere

That was me
The man I used to be
A lonely cloud who'd never found his destiny
Then you came
You touched my heart and told the pain to go
And now I know

A man who is loved has everything in life
And all his life is roses and rainbows and songbirds
That he knows never sang
For a man without love

That was me
The man I used to be
A lonely cloud who'd never found his destiny
Then you came
You touched my heart and told the pain to go
And now I know

A man who is loved has everything in life
And all his life is roses and rainbows and songbirds
That he knows never ѕang
For a mаn without love
