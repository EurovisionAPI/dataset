Without words

Without words we'll meet somewhere
We'll keep going hand in hand
As if many years didn't pass by

Without words, without questions and without lies
We'll find a piece of dream
That lives at the bottom of the heart all the time

Giving my inner self
You only know it, you understand it
Let's not pretend for a moment
Without words, without lies

Devotedly we'll separate without words in the morning
With eternal wish, that again
We may in a house of dream
Find our port

Giving my inner self
You only know it, you understand it
Let's not pretend for a moment
Without word, without lies

Devotedly we'll separate without words in the morning
With eternal wish, that again
We may in a houѕe of dreаm
Find our port
