Playboy

Fiery red cars, expensive leather seats
The latest model, I don't trust you
The society ladies, I'm not one of them
You charm, laugh, seduce, angry fathers blame you

You're a playboy, smooth playboy
Sure playboy, but I won't stick your net
You're a playboy, smooth playboy
Sure playboy, but I won't stick your net

Surfboarding, tennis and fencing
I glance at that, I don't trust you
What about winter sports: Girls, yes, and bobsleigh racing?
The winter of Sankt Moritz is desolate without you

You're a playboy, the same playboy
Pretty playboy, but I won't take up with you
You're a playboy, the same playboy
Pretty playboy, but I won't take up with you

Many wealthy ladies, many moneyprincesses
You deceive smiling, I don't trust you
You say your name is linked to 007
Noughts could be there, but I leave out the ѕeven

You're a playboy, real playboy
True playboy, I can live without you
You're a playboy, real playboy
True playboy, I can live without you

I cаn live without you
