Hope Never Dies

Wait for me, don't cross the sea of pain
Wait for me, I'm lost, I've gone astray
Ravens calling my name, their wings so dark
Soon they'll take me away, I have their mark
They never miss their prey

There is no light to pray for
Cold and dim are the skies
Wounded, lying, running out of life
Out of life

In your eyes I could see
Our hopes and our future
Now we must let go

Find me where the night turns into day
Turns into day, your love as a torch shows us the way
The way how to be whole again

There is no light to pray for
Cold and dim are the skies
Wounded, lying, running out of life
Out of life

In your eyes I could see
Our hopes and our future
Now we must let go

Must let go
Must let fade away
Or we can rise and fight

For a light to live for
Fire in our hearts
Through our pain
Through all the, all the lies

We will walk, wаlk reborn
Hope never dieѕ
Never let me go

Never let me go
