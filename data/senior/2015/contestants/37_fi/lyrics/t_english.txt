I always have to

I always have to clean
I always have to do the dishes
I always have to work
I always have to go to the doctor

I am not allowed to go to the computer
I am not allowed to watch television
I am not allowed to see my friends

I always have to be at home
I always have to do chores
I always have to eat well
I always have to drink well
I can't eat candy, drink soda
I can't even drink alcohol

I always have to rest
I always have to sleep
I always have to wake up
I always hаve to ѕhower
