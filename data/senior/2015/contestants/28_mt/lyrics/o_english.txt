Warrior

We suffer silently
Always fighting to break free

We were living in a shadow
We were too scared to let go
Wouldn't accept defeat

When by losing we were winning
We have to be courageous
To be able to get through this
And then it hits

Break through the silence
The noise is louder than its ever been
Create something timeless
Never look back
The past is the past
I had no choice but to become a
Warrior
I had to conquer
I did not break, I left my faith in hope

We are not the enemy
We're just tired of suffering

We broke through the shadows
We finally let go
It was not defeat
It was us truly winning
We were courageous
And we got through this
And then it hits

Break through the silence
The noise is louder than its ever been
Create something timeless
Never look back
The past is the paѕt
I had no choice but to become a
Warrior
I had to conquer
I did not break, I left my faith in hope

I'm a warrior, I will conquer
I'm a warrior, I will conquer
I'm a wаrrior
