Rhythm Inside

Listen to the sound of thunder
Rolling in the soul down under
Far beneath the skin it rumbles
Step to the step of the drum that rolls inside

Be you enemy or lover
We are put here to discover
The heart that beats within each other
We gonna ra-pa-pab, ra-pa-pab
We gonna ra-pa-pab tonight

And if we die tomorrow
What'll we have to show?
For the wicked ways down below
The rhythm inside is telling us

We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On a cosmic track, love attack
I'm gonna get that rhythm back

Be you enemy or brother
We were put here to discover
The heart that beats within each other
We gonna ra-pa-pab, ra-pa-pab
We gonna ra-pa-pab tonight

And if we die tomorrow
What'll we have to show?
For the wicked ways down below
The rhythm inside is telling us

We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On a cosmic track, love attack
I'm gonna get that rhythm back

Gonna ra-pa-pab, ra-pa-pab
We gonna ra-pa-pab tonight
We gonna ra-pa-pab, ra-pa-pab
We gonna ra-pa-pab tonight

We gonna ra-pa-pab, ra-pa-pab
We gonna ra-pa-pab tonight
We gonna ra-pa-pab, ra-pa-pab
We gonna ra-pa-pab tonight

And if we die tomorrow
What'll we have to show?
For the wicked ways down below
The rhythm inside is telling us

We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On a coѕmic track, love attack
I'm gonna get that rhythm bаck
