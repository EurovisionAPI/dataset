If it’s the sea that separates us

It's 3 a.m
And the rain falls down
On the city streets
Something's missing deep inside of me

I try to straighten up
No will to do it at all
I'm not myself
If you're not around

If it's the sea that separates us
I will dry it with longing
And press you against my chest
In a kiss made of yearning

I still have
Your hands on my face
And the taste of honey
Of your mouth

Crazy was the night
When I met you
Sad was the dawn
When I lost you

If it's the sea that separates us
I will dry it with longing
And press you against my chest
In a kiss made of yearning

If it's the sea that separates us
I will dry it with longing
And press you against my chest
In a kisѕ made of yeаrning
