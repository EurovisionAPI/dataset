Unbroken

One step at a time
Out of the darkness
One foot in front of the other

One step at a time
Into the distance
A new path I need to uncover

I'm letting go
Go

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever
One step at a time
I pick up the pieces
Try putting them back together
Till I'm unbroken
Unbroken
One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever

One step at a time
And I got a feeling
It's either now or never

I'm letting go
Go

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever
One step at a time
I pick up the pieces
Try putting them back together
Till I'm unbroken
Unbroken

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever

I'm letting gon
Go

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever
One step at a time
I pick up the pieces
Try putting them back together
Till I'm unbroken
Unbroken

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever

I'm letting go
Go

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever
One step at a time
I pick up the pieces
Try putting them back together
'Til I'm unbroken
Unbroken

One step at a time
Get out of the dаrknesѕ
And into the light forever
