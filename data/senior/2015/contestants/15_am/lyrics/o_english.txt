Face The Shadow

We find so many ways of fooling our heart
Playing too many games, trying to hide
When you follow your dream, surrender the sorrow inside
Face every shadow you deny

Feels like so many times life was unfair
Will you run and forget all the despair?
If it’s breaking you down, remember the power inside
Face every shadow you deny

Time is ticking and you keep thinking
That you are tricking your heart

So don’t deny
Ever, don’t deny
Baby, don’t deny
You and I

Across the ocean of blues happy you’ll be
Once you’ve risen you are meant to be free
When you’re feeling afraid remember there’s hope inside
Face every shadow purified

Time is ticking and you keep thinking
(Time is ticking, thinking)
That you are tricking your heart

So don’t deny
Ever, don’t deny
Listen, don’t deny (I don’t want you to deny)
You and I

Don’t deny
Ever, don’t deny
Listen, don’t deny (Liѕten)
Don’t deny you аnd I
