Wars For Nothing

Do you know our Earth is a mess?
All the wars for nothing, it never ends
Everybody deserves a chance
All the souls, all the souls
Can you hear them cry?

That you live in peace does not mean
It's okay to ignore all the pain
I see children joining the stars
Soldiers walk towards the dark
Let me ask

Can you justify all the eyes
That will never see daylight?
Give me one good reason to hurt
A helpless soul, break a heart
Kill a mind

Do you know how many innocents
Are hiding from punishment
For crimes they'd never commit?
All alone, all alone
Do they deserve

To die for believing something else?
For having a face someone can't stand
Do you know our Earth is a mess?
All the wars for nothing
It never ends

All the souls, all alone
Hold them tight
All the souls deѕerve a chаnce
At life
