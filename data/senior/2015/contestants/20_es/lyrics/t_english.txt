Dawn

He left without knowing
That I really love him
He left without believing in me

I lost my mind
I bled so much love
Still, today I feel the empty
It takes me along

I-ehh i-ehh ohh
I-ehh i-ehh ohh
my heart
whispered
Don't come back to me without his love

Road to Yesterday
Wherever you are
Today I challenge the oblivion

He left without knowing
that I'm not giving up

I-ehh i-ehh ohh
I-ehh i-ehh ohh
my heart
He whispered
Not me again without your love

I-ehh i-ehh ohh
I-ehh i-ehh ohh
Bring it me back
The soul stands
Restore to me dawn

You come back to me

I-ehh i-ehh ohh
I-ehh i-ehh ohh
my heart
He whispered
Not me again without your love

I-ehh i-ehh ohh
I-ehh i-ehh ohh
Bring it me back
The soul stands
Reѕtore to me dаwn

I-ehh i-ehh ohh
