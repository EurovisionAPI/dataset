Do I owe you something?
I think I do
They tied our hands
But I cut through

In the arms of the potion
They found our truth
And I made a burrow
Abandoned you

And I made the mess in your vision
And I see a debt to be paid
To give a little love was all I wanted
Give a little love was all my intent

And I was playing with numbers
And I didn't know what it meant

Please don't remind me
I won't be your news
Fragile misguided minds like mine
Only bow to you

Oh, while I played with white lies and fiction
Unbeknownst to you
I played the victim
Well that was the last time I pierced you

And I made the mess in your vision
And I see a debt to be paid
To give a little love was all I wanted
Give a little love was all my intent

And I was playing with numbers
And I didn't know what it meant

I can watch from afar, from my heart to my home
All along I was lost, I was worse, this is wrong
I can't force this, just watch as the surface surrenders it all

I made the mess in your vision
And I see a debt to be paid
To give a little love was all I wanted
Give a little love was all my intent

I was playing with numberѕ
And I didn't know what it meаnt
