This Time

This time I think I'm falling in love
This time you're sent from heaven above
Whoo oo

My God, stop for a minute and think
How about we just go out for a drink
Whoo oo

'Cause every time I close my eyes I feel you
I'm feeling love
Love, love
Round and round and round and round we go
I'm feeling love
Love, love
Round and round and round and right in my heart

This time I hope you don't mind
I help you put your troubles behind
Whoo oo

I know there's a reason for this
One kiss …
And you will see what you miss
Whoo oo

I'm feeling love
Love, love
Round and round and round and round we go
I'm feeling love
Love, love
Round and round and round and right in my heart

Is this how it goeѕ?
I don't know
Whoo oo

I'm feeling love
I'm feeling love
I'm feeling love
Whoo oo
Love
Round and round and round and right in my heаrt
