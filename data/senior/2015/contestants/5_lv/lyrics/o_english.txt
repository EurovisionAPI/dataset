Love Injected

You bring the light to my darkest side, babe
The day, the night split together side, ooh
You care, you animate
You got me bare, bring up the heartbreak

Your love revives my soul
And I know you choose it all over all

Your eyes are the mirror
Look under the cover
Love is above all
I'm safe into your hands
Let's move away, the urges expand

Your love revives my soul
And I know you choose it all over all

Show me the source of the light
I'm becoming affected
Seeing the glow of the way
Is what I have detected
Seeing it then in my life
It's a shiny reflected
Love injected, love injected

Your love revives my soul
And I know you chooѕe it all over аll
