Warrior

Fighter
Oximated
World gonna get up and see
I'm a warrior
Isolated
World gonna listen to me
Violence
Set the Free
Wings are gonna spread up
Still a fighter
Isolated
World gonna get up and see

I'm warrior
still stucked in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No no no
I'm warrior
still stucked in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No

Not a shabby
Or a money maker
World gonna light up in peace
Not in shadows
Bright a little
Not your fault you're just gonna breathe
Violence
Break the free
Wings are gonna spread up
Still a fighter
Oximated
I'm gonna get up and be

I'm warrior
Still stucked in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No no no
I'm warrior
Still stucked in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No

I'm warrior
still stucked in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No no no
I'm warrior
still stucked in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No no no

I'm warrior
still stucked in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No no no
I'm warrior
still ѕtucked in my mind
I've been in dаnger for too long
No no no
