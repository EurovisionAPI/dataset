Goodbye to Yesterday

I woke up at six AM
My eyes were closed but my mind was awake
Pretended I was breathing in a deep sleep pace

Got dressed so quietly
I was frozen by the jingle of my keys at the door
As I got outside I smiled to the dog

I didn't wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So I took my things and got out of the way now, girl

Why didn't you wake me up?
I'm pretty sure I would have told you to stop
Let's try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday

Why would you think like that
Yeah, we fight a lot, but in the end
You and I, we're a perfect match

I wouldn't want it any other way
But now you're gone and I'm all alone
Lying here naked and staring at the phone

I didn't wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So I took my things and got out of the way now, girl

Why didn't you wake me up?
I'm pretty sure I would have told you to stop
Let's try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday

I didn't wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So I took my things and got out of the way now, girl

Why didn't you wake me up?
I'm pretty sure I would have told you to stop
Let's try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday

Goodbye to yesterday
Ooh, goodbye to yeѕterdаy
