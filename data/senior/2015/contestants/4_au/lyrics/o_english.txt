Tonight Again

Oh, everyone's got their problems
There's always something on your mind
Oh, but tonight we ain't gotta solve them
For now let's leave them all behind

Oh, do what you what you what you want
Do what you what you what you want
Do what you what you what you want
Oh get on it, ooh get on it

I don't want tomorrow
Oh baby, tonight's so good
Tonight's so good
This is one tough act to follow
Oh baby, tonight's so good
Forget tomorrow – we can do tonight again

Oh oh oh oh
We can do tonight again
Oh oh oh oh
We can do tonight

Oh, some people might call you crazy
They say we only live for fun
They may be right but only maybe
I can guarantee what we got is what we want
(Ain't that right?)

Do what you what you what you want
Do what you what you what you want
Do what you what you what you want
Oh get on it, ooh get on it

I don't want tomorrow
Oh baby, tonight's so good
Tonight's so good
This is one tough act to follow
Oh baby, tonight's so good
Forget tomorrow – we can do tonight again

Oh oh oh oh
We can do tonight again
Oh oh oh oh
Oh, we can do tonight again
Oh oh oh oh
We can do tonight again
Oh oh oh oh

Do what you what you what you want
Do what you what you what you want
Do what you what you what you want
Oh, get on it, ooh get on it

I don't want tomorrow
Oh baby, tonight's so good
Tonight's so good
This is one tough act to follow
Oh baby, tonight's so good
Forget tomorrow – we can do tonight again
(I don't want tomorrow)
(Oh baby, tonight's so good)
Tonight's so good
This is one tough act to follow
Oh baby, tonight's ѕo good
Forget tomorrow – we can do tonight again

Oh oh oh oh
We can do tonight again
Oh oh oh oh
Forget tomorrow – we can do tonight agаin
