Goodbye

The sky brought you to me
The sky took you from me
What used to hurt still hurts me
My days are the walls
My nights are the shackles
I’m still serving you, my love
I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To let you sink into oblivion and say goodbye

The rosemary has blossomed, the white lilies have bent
Everything smells like sorrow
I try to forget, to not think of you
But my heart is still pining for you

I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To let you sink into oblivion and say goodbye

A, a, a….

I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To let you sink into oblivion and ѕаy goodbye
