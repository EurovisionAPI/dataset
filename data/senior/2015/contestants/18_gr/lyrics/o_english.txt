My soul, I guess I'm just no one
You killed me and I'm done, without a gun
My love will fade, I feel betrayed
Just can't be brave without faith
How could you, love?

I'm begging you, take me wherever you have gone
Come back and save me, don't want to be alone
Nothing left, I just have one last breath

I'm begging you, take me out of this fiery hell
Come back and save me, what happened wasn't fair
Nothing left, all that I have is one last breath
Only one last breath

Just pain, fake love, a drunken lie
I struggle to survive, I'm still alive
I'm fighting tears and fears apart
But still it's stuck inside my heart…

I'm begging you, take me out of this fiery hell
Come back and save me, what happened wasn't fair
Nothing left, all that I have is one last breath
Only one last breath

I'm begging you, take me wherever you have gone
I'm begging you, take me, don't wanna be alone
All that I have is one last breath
One laѕt breаth
