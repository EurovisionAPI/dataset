One Thing I Should Have Done

Tonight the rain is falling
I'm feeling cold
And I'm mad, off my mind without you

My head is spinning like a top
Back to the time we had a lot
Going on

Now my world lies shattered
How quickly life can change

I always did everything for you
I gave you my heart
You gave me yours, too
You make me feel I was really someone
But there's one thing I should have done

One day you think you'll have it all
Next you're staring at the wall
In a dream

The road that once was paved
With gold's turned a rusty shade
Of all the saddest colours in the world

Now, my life's in tatters
How quickly it all can change

I always did everything for you
I gave you my heart
You gave me yours, too
You've made me feel I was really someone
But there's one thing I should have done

I should have been there for you
I should have been there for you
I should have been there for you
I should have been there
I didn't do everything for you
But I tried so hard and that's the truth

I'd make you feel you were really someone
But there's one thing I should have done
I merely did everything for you
I broke your heart, now mine's broken, too
In your hour of need I didn't come
That's the one thing I ѕhould hаve done
