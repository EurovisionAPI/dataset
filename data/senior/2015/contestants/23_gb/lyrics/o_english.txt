Still in Love with You

Well, don't get on the wrong train
Don't fly on an old plane
Don't go out in the pouring rain
You might get wet, I'd be upset

You're bound to get sneezes
Or nasty diseases
Take good care when I'm not there
I'm still in love with you

While I'm on vacation
You be a good patient
Take your medication
I worry so each time I go

Try to keep warm, dear
In case there's a storm, dear
Take good care when I'm not there
I'm still in love with you

Some younger guys with roving eyes
May tantalise you with their lies
You must be wise and realise
Leave well alone till you get home, dear

Won't steal the fellas
Don't wanna make you jealous
No need to fear when you're not here
I'm still in love with you

(Let's dance, dance)
(Dance)

Don't walk on the red light
Don't stay out at midnight
Don't get in a fist fight
That pretty face can't be replaced

Don't get out at night, hun
It wouldn't be right, hun
No need to fear when you're not here
I'm still in love with you

Oh yes?
(Everybody dance, everybody dance)
(Everybody dance)
(Everybody dance, everybody dance)

Sounding good
You take care now, honey

Don't make a fuss, you need to trust me
This is how it always must be
When I start to think of us
I can assure you, I adore you

Because you're so gorgeous
You need to be cautious
Take good care when I'm not there
I'm still in love with you

(Da-da-da-dance)
You have a fun time (Dance)
You soak up that sunshine (Let's dance)
But don't drink too much wine
Just one or two will have to do (Everybody dance)

I know what you're thinking (Everybody dance)
So I might be drinking
No need to feаr when you're not here
I'm still in love with you

I'm still in love with you
I'm ѕtill in love with you
