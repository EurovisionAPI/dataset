I Want Your Love

Hey girl
Remind me why we ain't together
We got that magnetic connection
Moving so fast, let's take it slow
Ain't gonna let you let me go

The future that you're painting
Got me all anticipating

Nothing can steal your thunder
Sky high when you pull me under
'Cause you got what I want, what I want
What I want, want, want, want

Yeah baby, let me show ya
You got me drifting over
'Cause you got what I want, what I want
What I want, want, want, I want your love

I want your love, I want your love
I want your love

Hey girl
Even if there's stormy weather
You've got my heartbeat beating faster
And I'm not gonna let you down
No your feet ain't gonna touch the ground

The future that you're painting
Got me all anticipating

Nothing can steal your thunder
Sky high when you pull me under
'Cause you got what I want, what I want
What I want, want, want, want

Yeah baby, let me show ya
You got me drifting over
'Cause you got what I want, what I want
What I want, want, want, I want your love

I want your love, I want your love
I want your love

Oh yeah
The picture that you're painting
Got me anticipating

Nothing can steal your thunder
Sky high when you pull me under
'Cause you got what I want, what I want
What I want, want, want, I want your love

Yeah baby, let me show ya
You got me drifting over
'Cause you got what I want, what I want
What I want, want, want, I want your love

Nothing can steal your thunder
Sky high when you pull me under
'Cause you got what I want, what I want
What I want, want, want, want

Yeah baby, let me show ya
You got me drifting over
'Cauѕe you got what I want, what I want
What I want, want, want, I want your love

I want your love, I want your love
I wаnt your love
