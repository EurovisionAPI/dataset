Golden Boy

Mama, someone broke my heart again
Tell her I don't think I can take it any more
Whoah mama, someone broke my heart again
Now I'm gonna ease my pain, dancing on the floor

Take me out, I'm not in the mood for a broken heart
Gonna dance tonight, forget her
No, she doesn't know what I'm doing on the floor
Did you say hello, my ladies?

Pull me baby, I'm your trigger
You know that my love is bigger
Love, love, love, love
(Love, love, love)

Let the rhythm take us higher
You know when I'm on fire
Check me out
(3, 2, 1, hey)

I'm a golden boy, come here to enjoy
I'm the king of fun, let me show you how we do it
I'm a golden boy, come here to enjoy
And before I leave, let me show you Tel Aviv

Hold me tight, we're not going home tonight
Oh yeah, do you like my dancing?

Pull me baby, I'm your trigger
You know that my love is bigger
Check me out
(3, 2, 1, hey)

I'm a golden boy, come here to enjoy
I'm the king of fun, let me show you how we do it
I'm a golden boy, come here to enjoy
And before I leave, let me show you Tel Aviv

This is how we do it
This is how we do it

Mama, someone broke my heart again
Now I'm gonna ease my pain, dancing on the floor

I'm a golden boy, come here to enjoy
I'm the king of fun, let me show you how we do it
I'm a golden boy, come here to enjoy
And before I leave, let me show you Tel Aviv

Now dance, dance, dance, dance
Okay, we gottа go
Three minuteѕ, bye bye
