Chain Of Lights

No

I don't wanna dream forever
Of a time when peace was more than just a simple word
I wanna find a better way of living
And connect my tears and fears with friends 
Understanding and forgiving
Must give this world a final chance

I can feel life is changin'
Times are rearrangin'
In so many many ways
Let us try to make the world
A better place

So light up the candles
Let's illuminate the night
Just light up the candles
Let Them shine on deep inside
Build a chain of light for you 
And a chain of light for me
And believe that we can change reality

We've only got one life
So let's try to make our dreams survive
Maybe we'll find out that many people feel the same – oh yeah
One's a lonely number – but together
We can make a million candles 
Shine forever
Let us build a chain of hearts
In a world that's blue and dark

So light up the candles
Let's illuminate the night
An' together hand in hand
We will feel the love inside
Build a chain of love for you
(chain of love for you)
And a chain of love for me
(chain of love for me)
We will let our vision change reality

If we all light a candle
We could build a chain of light
If we all walk together
We will feel the love inside
It's a chain of hearts for you
Chain of hearts for you
And a chain of hearts for me
Chain of hearts for me
Let's create a world that's human, fair and bright

If we all light a candle
(If we all light a candle)
We'd illuminate the night
(We'd illuminate the night)
If we all walk together
(Yes we should)
We will feel the love inside
It's a chain of light for you 
Chain of light for you
And a chain of light for me
Chain of light for me
We can build a peaceful world – 
Let's do it right
Standing side by side
It's a chain of love for you
Chain of love for you
And a chain of love for me
Chain of love for me
Let's create a world that'ѕ human, fair аnd bright
