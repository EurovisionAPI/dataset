Don’t forget

Only tears remain for me
These few notes from the past
And the melody of our prayers
Our hearts, that are hoping
And the emptiness beneath my steps

Only ashes remain for me
My village plunges into silence
I am only a wound
A heart without armor
How to survive after that?

But I am there
I don't forget
In my village
Swept away by history
And I live there
Don't forget
Erased from the maps and memories

I remember the children laughing
The voices of the men leaving for the fields
Harvest celebrations
The smell inside houses
Bursts of love and joy

But I am there
Don't forget
Erased from the maps and memories

When they arrived
Hidden behind their weapons
They were thousands
They laughed at our tears
They wanted to destroy
My beliefs under their fire
With the words of hatred
Which were unknown to us

I am here tonight
In the middle of these ruins
In order to talk about hope
And to sing about life
And I make the promiѕe
That when the blood will dry
I will rebuild my village
Even more beautiful thаn before
But don't forget
