Autumn Leaves

Met in the dark of night you were my lucky strike crazy kids with out a clue
Hanging from our knees up in the willow trees easy like the month of June
A fairytale gone right with no ending in sight had me tangled up in blue
You said we'd never change but maybe we do

Baby this is all we ever used to know 
But I can see your colours change to red and gold

Every moment will hurt
From the last to the ﬁrst
And I'm trying ﬁnd a way to breathe
Close the book and the chapter forever and after 
I'm falling like the autumn leaves
My heart is beating like a million drums
Cuz you're the ground under my feet
I'm trying to hold on but baby I'm falling free
Like the autumn leaves 

Baby this is all we ever used to know 
But I can see your colours change to red and gold

Every moment will hurt
From the last to the ﬁrst
And I'm trying ﬁnd a way to breathe 
Close the book and the chapter forever and after 
I'm falling like the autumn leaves 
My heart is beating like a million drums
Cuz you're the ground under my feet 
I'm trying to hold on but baby I'm falling free 
Like the autumn leаveѕ
