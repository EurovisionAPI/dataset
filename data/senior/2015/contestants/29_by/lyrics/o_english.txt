Time

Tell me where I belong
I've been trying for so long
Breaking out through the night
Made me see the bright light
Now I'm willing to fight
And I know that time is on my side

Time is like thunder ah-ah
Hear it like thunder ah-ah
All we've got are some days
And I try not to waste

Time is like thunder ah-ah
Beating like thunder in our heads
Time is like thunder ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah

I don't wanna wait any longer
I don't wanna wait any longer
I don't wanna wait any longer
I don't wanna wait any longer

At the end of your rope
Keep on hoping against the hope
Oh-oh
Time is fading away
So don't you lose a day
We can do what we say

Time is like thunder
No more
Time is like thunder
I know, you know
Time is like thunder
I don't want to wait

Ooh, like thunder, like thunder
You know, I know
Don't you lose a day

Time is like thunder ah-ah
Hear it like thunder ah-ah
All we've got are some days
And I try not to waste

Time is like thunder ah-ah
Beating like thunder
Time iѕ like thunder ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah

I don't wanna wait аny longer
