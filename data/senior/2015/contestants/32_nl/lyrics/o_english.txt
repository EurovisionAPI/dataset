I open up my heart to you
I cry for your attention
Still you haven't seen it yet
You only see me as a friend
But I wish you were waiting
With roses at sunset
Why? why-y-y, why-y-y-y?
Won't you walk along, walk along
Baby
Why? why-y-y, why-y-y-y?
Won't you walk along, walk along
Baby

Gentle smile passing your way
It's not that I don't try
But you don't even notice me here
In another time and place,
Another lifetime maybe
If only for a little while
Why? why-y-y, why-y-y-y?
Won't you walk along, walk along
Baby
Why? why-y-y, why-y-y-y?
Won't you walk along, walk along
Baby

I don't seem to get you
To look at me one time
Won't you walk along, walk along
Baby, this is not a little cruѕh
Don't wanna wait in line
Won't you walk along, walk along
Baby!

Uuh uuh
Uuh uuh
I love you, I love you baby
Uuh uuh
Uuh uuh
If only for a little while

Why? why-y-y, why-y-y-y?
Won't you walk along, walk along
Baby
Why? why-y-y, why-y-y-y?
Won't you walk along, walk along
Baby
Why? Why-y-y, why-y-y-y?
I love you, I love you baby
Why? Why-y-y, why-y-y-y?
Won't you walk along, walk along bаby
