I'm Alive

I was too afraid right from the start
To even let you welcome in my heart
You cut it deep and left it bleeding
How will I ever heal these painful scars?

I just can't help it
I'm out of breath, I'm trying to find the words to say
Time passed by
Now it's brought the light

I know you'll come, with the speed of light
You're my everything, all that I need
You shut down my dreams, but I'm not gonna cry
You live within me, 'cause I am alive

I am alive, 'cause you are my life
You are my sun
I am alive, 'cause you are my life

You name is printed crystal clear on the lights
From all the sighs coming on my breath
I'm blinded by this love, can't stop screaming out your name so loud
Where are you? Where? Baby, won't you come back?

(Baby, please come back)
(Baby, please come back)
(Baby, please come back)

I know you'll come, with the speed of light
You're my everything, all that I need
You shut down my dreams, but I'm not gonna cry
You live within me, that's why I'm alive

I am alive, 'cause you are my life
You are my sun
I am alive, 'cause you are my life
Yeah…

(I know you'll come, with the speed of light)
You're my everything, you're all that I need
You shut down my dreams, but I'm not gonna cry
You live within me, that's why I'm alive

I am alive, 'cause you are my life
You are my sun
I am alive, 'cauѕe you аre my life
