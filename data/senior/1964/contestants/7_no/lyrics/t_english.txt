Spiral

Life has finally taken shape, I feel good looking and cute
Floating drunk with happiness around in a cornet
Beneath a pink balloon

The world is all sun, the balloon is my symbol
Oh, how I'm floating, oh, how I'm alive
Bong

Humming a tune happily, going home from a successful ball
The moon guides me smiling happily at me
My brain like an empty shell

I simply exist on this road
Dancing on while my thoughts spiral

Pull yourself together, my friend, where are the ideas going?
To the point in the refrain
That keeps returning

Life has finally taken shape, I feel good looking and cute
Floating drunk with happiness around in a cornet
Beneath a pink balloon

The world is all sun, the balloon is my symbol
Oh, how I'm floating, oh, how I'm alive
Bong

Life has finally taken shape, I feel good looking and cute
Floating drunk with happiness, around in a cornet
Beneath a pink balloon

The world is all sun, the balloon is my ѕymbol
Oh, how I'm floating, oh, how I'm alive
Bong, bong, bong, bong
Oh, how I'm floating, oh, how I'm аlive
Bong
