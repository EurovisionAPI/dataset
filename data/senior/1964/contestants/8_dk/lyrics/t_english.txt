The song about you

The song about you is never over
It wakes up happy, when the day starts
It is like a soft, gentle melody
To me humming

A thousand things from far or near
Sending me word with tempting voices:
You alone is the one that I love
Never forgetting

Hope can burst
And people disappoint me bitterly
But the song, that I still have
It lights a candle for my spirits again

The song about you, the melody of my life
Humming about everything, that you have given me
The song about you is never over
For for me, you are the entire life

The poets write so many times
About the power of love
But even the most wonderful songs
Don't get everything said

What is sorrow or joy
Lives in the deepest of the hearts
Whether I'll laugh or cry
I'll be hearing a song without words

The song about you, the melody of my life
Humming about everything, that you have given me
The song about you iѕ never over
For for me, you аre the entire life
