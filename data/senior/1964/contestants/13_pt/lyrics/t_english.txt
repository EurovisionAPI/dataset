Prayer

God, at Your feet I confess
God, I hurted my love
God, I ask for Your forgiveness, but I don't deserve it
God, I despised my love and sinned

Pardon me, I beg You
God, You are redemption
I know I lost her, but I love her, so I cry
God, asking for her forgiveness

God, I confess the perjury of so many promesses
God, I made some mistakes, but in life I found a lesson
God, I beg You, God
Oh my God, don't forget my prayer
God, oh endless kindness, give me Your forgiveness

Love, I had never found love in life
It's late, I walk through life, lost in pain
God, this love is more precious
Than the rarest jewells, the most precious one of loves
God, if love is а puniѕhment, forgive me, my God
