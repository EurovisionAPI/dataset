How quickly we get used to nice things

A strange man came from somewhere
And gave me love and happiness
I gave him my heart, a love began
I saw only him and never looked back

How quickly we get used to nice things
And then you can't get away from it anymore
How quickly we get used to nice things
And when it's over, the disappointment is great

Love, love, what a lovely game
It never, never becomes too much for you

How quickly we get used to nice things
And then you can't get away from it anymore
How quickly we get used to nice things
And when it's over, the disappointment is great

Faithfulness, faithfulness, what a big word
Tears, tears, he left me alone

How quickly we get used to nice things
And then you can't get away from it anymore
How quickly we get used to nice things
And when it's over, the disappointment is great

Love, love, what a lovely game
It never, never becomes too much for you

How quickly we get used to nice things
And then you can't get away from it anymore
How quickly we get used to nice things
And when it's over, the disappointment iѕ greаt
