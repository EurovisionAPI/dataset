My thoughts

I've always been looking in the time
To give you better thoughts
Looking in the sky, I was searching
And up there, I've seen how to do it
Therefore… therefore…

I confide my thoughts to a cloud
That will bring them to you far away
The wind will slowly push them
Up above in the sky, into the endlessness

Perhaps star words are able to unite
They'll be golden letters written in the sky for you
The sun will certainly make them shine
So you will see them up there with me

I confide my thoughts to a cloud
It will slowly, slowly arrive without making noise
My love will reach you

I confide my thoughts to a cloud
It will slowly, slowly arrive without making noise
My love will reach you

The whole world will know what I'm thinking of you
Those golden flockѕ аre for you
