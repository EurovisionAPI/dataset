Conch

The voice of the sea prisoner
Is kept in the conch
So your voice didn't flee
My heart enclosed it
I love you, how much I love you
The echo repeated me

Why, between sky and sea
Between shadow and light, did I see your eyes?
Why did I suddenly feel
That day sinking in my heart?

Why did you save me
And did the sea give it to you when the wave came?
Why did your love invade
My beach which yesterday was so lonely?

That's how your voice changed
My heart into your conch

Why did you save me
And did the sea give it to you when the wave came?
Why did your love invade
My beach which yesterday was so lonely?

That'ѕ how your voice changed
My heаrt into your conch
Of love, of love
