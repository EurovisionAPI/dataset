You're my life

I know that you're lying
And that you're cheating on me
But I accept it
Because you're my life

All the things you said
Will come to nothing
That has many times
Chased away confidence

But I'm staying next to you
Wherever you might go
Nothing can separate us

I know that you're lying
And that you're cheating on me
But I accept it
Because you're my life

You, you could fantasize
That you almost believe it yourself
You, you did every time
Promise me heaven on earth

I know that you're lying
And that you're cheating on me
But I accept it
Because you're my life

All the things you said
Will come to nothing
That has many times
Chased away confidence

But I stay next to you
Wherever you might go
Nothing can separate us

I know that you're lying
And that you're cheating on me
But I accept it
Because you're my life

I know that you're lying
And that you're cheating on me
But I accept it
Because you're my life
Because you're my life
Becаuѕe you're my life
