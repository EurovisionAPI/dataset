I'm not old enough

I'm not old enough
I'm not old enough to love you
I'm not old enough to go out alone with you

And I wouldn't have
I wouldn't have anything to say
Because you know many more thingѕ than me

Let me live a romantic love
While I'm waiting for that day to come
But not now

I'm not old enough
I'm not old enough to love you
I'm not old enough to go out alone with you

If you want
If you want to wait for me
Some day all my love will be for you

Let me live a romantic love
While I'm waiting for that day to come
But not now

I'm not old enough
I'm not old enough to love you
I'm not old enough to go out alone with you

If you want
If you want to wait for me
Some day аll my love will be for you
