Only why, why?

Only why, why everything has to pass by?
Oh… only why, why nothing stays forever?
You leave me, you don't turn your head back
Give me the answer - only why, why?

Only why, why the flowers bloom so beautiful
Oh… when will they fade and die?
A dream escapes, the time is up
Please, give me the answer - only why, why?

Often I hear your words: I will be yours in eternity
I believed you, but it just was a pretence

Mmm… only why, why should everything be like this?
Oh… only why, why am I so alone now?
Before you leave me, turn your head back
And then give me the аnѕwer - only why, why?
Why? Why?
