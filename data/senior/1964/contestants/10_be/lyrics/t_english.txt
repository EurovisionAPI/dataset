Nearby my river

Nearby my river, with silver reflections
Between heaven and earth, we loved each other much
In the light grass we forgot our oath
Nearby my river, with silver fishes

There, the world was so far away
There, there was nothing left
Nothing but my eyes in your eyes
Nothing, nothing but the both of us

Nearby my river, with silver reflections
Between heaven and earth, we loved each other much

The river is flowing and the time is flowing away
Sad and ѕolitary, I'm coming now

Nearby my river, where we loved each other much
Nearby my river, where we loved eаch other much
