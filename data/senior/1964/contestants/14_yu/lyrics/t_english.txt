Life has come full circle

There is no escape anymore
The world has closed the circle
So may the plant and the bird
Be like a human, like a friend

And if I became a branch
My leaves would ponder
Oh, and the red gold would not
Teem only in the autumn

If I turned into stone
I would not be forgotten
I would be the only one on the shore
A thinking, blue stone

There is no escape anymore
Life has come full circle
So may the hill and the dusk
Be like a human, like a friend

If I turned into stone
I would not be forgotten
I would be the only one on the shore
A thinking, blue stone

There is no escape anymore
Life has come full circle
So may the hill and the duѕk
Be like a human, like а friend
