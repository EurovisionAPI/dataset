Lovely summer's day

The morning sun glitters in the bay
The day dawns, and for the last time the Hanö lighthouse flashes
Can you see our sailing boat, can you hear the music
As we steer towards a new adventure

Hum a song, sing a melody
Hum a tune that reminds you of summer
Feel the scent of the salty seas
As we're humming a song, singing a melody
Humming a tune that reminds you of summer
Sing about a lovely summer's day

Wind from the east, steaming waves and whitecaps
Filling sails that flap as we go towards our island

In a bay we cast anchor
Have a dip, have a good time on a flat rock, warmed by the sun
Before we walk home at an easy pace
On the island on a nice summer's night

Hum a song, sing a melody
Hum a tune that reminds you of summer
Feel the scent of the salty seas
As we're humming a song, singing a melody
Humming a tune that reminds you of summer
Sing about a lovely summer, summer

La la la la la la la la… la la la la la la la la la la…
La la la la la la la la la la…
La la la la la la la la la la… la la la la la la la la la la…

Sing about a lovely summer
Lovely day, lovely summer'ѕ dаy
