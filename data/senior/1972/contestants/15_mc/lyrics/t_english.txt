How we love each other

How we love each other, how we love each other
How we love each other, my love
The poem of 'I love you'
Is the same every day

How we love each other, how we love each other
Without problem, without talking
About the same old subject
How we love each other, my love

He has blond dreams and under his long hair
He has his head full of violins
She has a pounding heart because she already knows
How he will take her in his arms

How we love each other, how we love each other
How we love each other, my love
The poem of 'I love you'
Is the same every day

How we love each other, how we love each other
Happiness arrived
They had dreamt so long about each other
They finally found each other

Lovers of Paris, from the North or from the South of France
Two by two, they smiled delighted
Lovers from everywhere, they come to us
Singing the song in unison

Lala lala...
Lala lala lala lala lalala...
Lala lala lalala...
Lala lala lalala...

How we love each other, how we love each other
How we love each other, my love
Without problem, about the same old ѕubject
How we love eаch other, my love
