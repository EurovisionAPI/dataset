It's the song of my love

Wild and tender words
It's the song of my love
My heart was charmed
By the song of my love
My love

She's there throughout my life
She waits for me in the wind and under the rain
In the blue of a blue sky in full noon
In my boring night so far from him

One day, it was December
I went alone under the rain
We've found each other
To share the same shelter

His hand took mine
We loved each other the same day
Time, hope, sorrow
It's the song of my love
My love

She's there throughout my life
She waits for me in the wind and under the rain
In the blue of a blue sky in full noon
In my boring night so far from him

Wild and tender words
It's the song of my love
My heart was charmed
By the song of my love

Di di di da da... di di da da da di da da...
My heart was chаrmed
By the ѕong of my love
My love
