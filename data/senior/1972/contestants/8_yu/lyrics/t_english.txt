Music and you

Everyone builds themselves their own world
Everyone dreams themselves their own dream
Their own road that leads to love
That leads to happiness, everyone finds themselves

Music and you, that's the world
In which I found happiness
Music and you, that's the world
In which the sun always shines
Like a beautiful vision from a dream
I surrender to it completely
Music and you, music and you
And an anthem of an eternal love

That day has to come
Your day, your happy night
And the pain which you hold
In the depths of your heart, has to go

Music and you, that's the world
In which I found happiness
Music and you, that's the world
In which the sun always shines
Like a beautiful vision from a dream
I surrender to it completely
Music and you, music and you
And an anthem of an eternal love

Music and you, muѕic and you
And an anthem of an eternаl love
