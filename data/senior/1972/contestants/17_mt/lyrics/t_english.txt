Love

I searched for wise men, philosophers and poets
So I could ask them this question:
"What is youth's big love?"
I felt the answer in my heart

Love is a kiss, a kiss, a kiss 
Something that touches your heart and they call it "kiss" 
Love is a kiss as sweet as sugar
That is pushed by the lips while the eyes are shut

And while the heart beats with enthusiasm
And feels the veins burn with fire
Whether it's given straight or it's stolen
In the middle of the night, in the harshest of the day

I went to find the freaks, Hell's Angels
And the hippies and I also asked them my question
I always got the same answer from them
And then in the words of all these I came to:

Love is a kiss, a kiss, a kiss 
Something that touches your heart and they call it "kiss" 
Love is a kiss as sweet as sugar
That is pushed by the lips while the eyes are shut

And while the heart beats with enthusiasm
And feels the veins burn with fire
Whether it's given straight or it's stolen
In the middle of the night, in the harshest of the day

Love is a kiss, a kiss, a kiss 
Something that touches your heart and they call it "kiss" 
Love is a kiss as sweet as sugar
That is pushed by the lips while the eyes are shut

The Italians and also the Spanish
The German, English and Maltese
I asked them all what they understood under love
And their answer is this:

Love is a kiss,  a kiss and а kisѕ
