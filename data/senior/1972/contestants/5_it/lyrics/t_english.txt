The days of the rainbow

Those were the days of the rainbow
When the winter ended, the good weather came back
And you, with the moon and the stars in your eyes
Felt a hand touching your skin

And while you went crazy for the scent of flowers
The night was lit with a thousand colours
Outspread on the grass, like someone who's dreaming
You were lying, little girl, but you got up as a woman

Now you have grown bigger
You're stronger and safer
And the sweet adventure already started
Now they're little girls, old friends
Who meet in group for playing
And still dream on a moon beam

You live your life as an important woman
Because at the age of sixteen, you already feel grown up
But one day you'll see that every woman is mature
At the right time and with the right measure
And on your course you'll find love
You leave the pаst behind for better timeѕ
