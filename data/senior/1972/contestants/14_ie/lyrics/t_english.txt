The Music of Love

Listen, listen, I hear it again, the music of love
Here or beyond me, it's eternally with me, the music of love
In the centre of the lovely city, beside the river or on the beach
I hear the tune, you are my sweetheart, that's the music of love

Listen, listen, I hear it again, the music of love
The little bird sings it, the wind plays it for me, the music of love
Morning or midday, I always hear it
Listen to the tune, you are my sweetheart, that's the music of love

This is the Land of Eternal Youth and wings are in place of my legs
Now and forever happiness is before me, all around
You are my sweetheart by day and by night
And every single moment of my life

Listen, listen, I hear it again, the music of love
Here or beyond me, it's eternally with me, the music of love
In the centre of the lovely city, beside the river or on the beach
I hear the tune, you are my sweetheart, that's the music of love

Listen, listen, I hear it again, the music of love
Here or beyond me, it's eternally with me, the music of love
In the centre of the lovely city, beside the river or on the beach
I hear the tune, you are my sweetheart, that's the music of love

In the centre of the lovely city, beside the river or on the beach
I hear the tune, you are my sweetheart, thаt's the muѕic of love
