Do you remember

Do you remember that sweetest night
The lovely day and the beautiful evening
The moment, when you took my hand first time
To your own warm hand

We walked together only a while
Through a little park, over an old bridge
That little moment was enough to give us happiness then

We met amid the crowd
A coincidence? No, I know it
Destiny brought love in front of us and the land of happiness

Even sorrow is partly happiness
It just has to be realized as part of life
Why would a human otherwise have a skill to laugh?

We walked together only a while
Through a little park, over an old bridge
That little moment was enough to give us happiness then

Did I see you in a dream before?
I think that was the reason for my feeling
I have earlier lived a little moment too

All that must still be just a dream
Park, bridge, and the warm hand of yours
In a second I lived a life almoѕt eternal
