Passionately or not at all

We love passionately or not at all
Love is nothing when it doesn't drive crazy
But whatever we say to flowers
We love each other a bit much and we believe it

When I pick (When I pick )
A wildflower (A wildflower)
It's only in the wind (It's only in the wind)
That I defoliate it (That I defoliate it)

A bit much: those words scared us
It's never enough in the grey of the heart
Love is nothing when it doesn't drive us crazy
We love passionately or not at all

We love passionately or not at all
Love is nothing when it doesn't drive crazy
But whatever we say to flowers
We love each other a bit much and we believe it

We love passionately or not at all
Love is nothing when it doesn't drive crazy
But whatever we say to flowerѕ
We love each other a bit much аnd we believe it
