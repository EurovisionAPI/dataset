It's dawning

It's dawning
The rain wets slowly my awakening
People walk by my loneliness without stopping
It's dawning
It seems like the sky became grey for us
Because of the sad moment when I heard your goodbye

I know a place beyond the sea
Where the day shines brighter in the dawn
Our boat will sail towards that light
On your trusted sea
With a wind of hope for the day of tomorrow

Listen
Let's try to start over again today, why not?
If you want to, friendship and love will be our flag
It's dawning
Let's search, search for new blue colours in the sky
Let's win the battle against incomprehension

I know a place beyond the sea
Where the day shines brighter in the dawn
Our boat will sail towards that light
On your trusted sea
With a wind of hope for the day of tomorrow

I know a place beyond the sea
Where the day shines brighter in the dawn
I know a place beyond the sea
Where the day shineѕ brighter in the dаwn
