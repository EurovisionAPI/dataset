Little things

Saving up money, treasures or gold
Inherit a castle, that we can, but what is that
Compared to everyday happiness?

Travel the world, feel free
Land on the moon, that we can, but what is that?
Open your eyes and you'll see…

Little things, little things, to be of use
Little things, little things, that's to listen
Little things, little things, to be happy

Little things, little things, to talk about the weather
Little things, little things, to meet loved ones
Little things, little things, it's a little song

Look forward to every day, there are so many different ones
There are days better than you expect
Cut down on your demands, stop all the stressing
Relax and smile, there is no doubt that

Little things, little things, to take a walk on the beach
Little things, little things, to write in the sand
Little things, little things, to watch a sunset

Look forward to every day, there are so many different ones
There are days better than you expect
Cut down on your demands, stop all the stressing
Relax and smile, there is no doubt that

Little things, little things, to take a walk on the beach
Little things, little things, to write in the sand
Little things, little things, to watch a sunset

To watch a sunset, to watch а sunset

Little things, little things, little things, little thingѕ
