The party of life

May come the sun, the wine, the flowers
Tides, songs, all colours
May wars be forgotten thanks to love
May already come the embraces
Put on the smile of a clown
Forget sadness and tiredness

May come all the parties
And may nobody forget the kisses
May come the gifts of joy
And may the party last until daybreak

May no expenses be spared
May all sadness be kept far away
May there be bread, wine and roses on the table
May blankets and rugs be brought along
May the wine flow in our throats
And may the party laѕt all night long

May everyone come out of free will
May all longing be forgotten
May young and old people come
Without giving me any advice

(Pu du du pu pu pu pu pu…)
(Pu du du pu pu pu pu pu…)

May young and old people come
Without giving me any advice

May everyone come out of free will
May all longing be forgotten
May young and old people come
Without giving me any аdvice

Ah…
