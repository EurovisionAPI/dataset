Thanks, no!

My name is Lea
And I have a new look for you
Lots of smiles and freedom
Like the most virtual trick
One step away from winning
One step away from the light
From perfection

I fight with a smile to reach the sun
I fight for people
The road to truth
Blinds me
That first love
Comes to fool you
But I take everything
That sets the body free

Don't believe in everything
That they offer you
Think loudly and hope
That the secret of everything is in it
Don't sell your soul to everybody
This is so passé

No, no thanks
No thanks
No, no thanks
No thanks, no thanks

A zillion people have already said
That there's too many
Of those living in misery
And without light
One smile for happiness
One smile for people
For those full of worry

I won't give my soul to anyone
I'll keep it for myself
True art cannot have a price tag
Every single answer
Is already in me
I find it during my sleep
When my body is relaxed
And perceptive to everything

Don't believe in everything
That they offer you
Think loudly and hope
That the secret of everything is in it
Don't sell your soul to everybody
This is so passé

Don't believe in everything
That they offer you
Think loudly and hope
That the secret of everything is in it
Don't sell your soul to everybody
This is so passé

No, no thanks
No thanks
No, no thanks
No thanks, no thanks

I am a marionette for the people
Hiding over masks
Equal, perfect, not satisfied
Thanks, no, no, no

Don't believe in everything
What is offered to you
Think with a loud voice
That the secret is in
Not to sell everybody
This is passe

No
