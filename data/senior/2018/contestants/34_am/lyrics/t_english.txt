Wind

The winds are deaf and dumb
When there is an abyss deep down in my soul
The loneliness is becoming my friend
What is the cost of your love?
It asks that simple question
It asks it the clouds which get your image

What is the cost of a madcap's wounds
Which have been opened by your love
Closing my existence in itself?

Wind, wind
Where have you taken my warm memories?
Oh wind, oh wind
Give me wings
So I could follow you, oh wind

I am closing my eyes
And it seems I can see
The way which brings me to you

The stars were lying
When they were saying
That the love of the soul
Searching for the light is invincible

Wind, wind
Where have you taken my wаrm memories?
Oh wind, oh wind
Give me wings
So I could follow you, oh wind

Give, give me wings
Give give me wingѕ
So I could fly high, fly high
Ooh, ouh, ouououh
