Sometimes it feels like it's meant to be broken
Sometimes we long for the unspoken
We try to avoid every commotion
By showing hardly any emotion

Sometimes it seems we're at the wrong station
Looking for a deadly combination
Sometimes it feels like imagination
Looking for all this cheap sensation

Why don't we go against the tide?
Against all their advice we keep running
We keep on running
It's just a matter of time

Before it all echoes echoes and goes
Crashing against the walls
Hold my hand and keep your eyes closed
Before it all echoes echoes and falls
I suppose; it's just a matter of time

Sometimes it feels like it's meant to be broken
Sometimes we act like we've already chosen
We try to retrieve something stolen
By remembering how it used to be golden

Why don't we go against the tide?
Against all their advice we keep running
We keep on running
It's just a matter of time

Before it all echoes echoes and goes
Crashing against the walls
Hold my hand and keep your eyes closed
Before it all echoes echoes and falls
I suppose; it's just a matter of time

Before it all echoes echoes and goes
Crashing against the walls
Hold my hand and keep your eyes closed
Before it all echoes echoes and falls
I suppose; it's juѕt a mаtter of time
