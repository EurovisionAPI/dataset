Stones

Wild joker on the golden throne
Blood diamond summer home
Wrong people with the right to know
But I can't do anything about it

All saying that life's hard
But we don't want it in our backyard
We should be further from the start
But I can't do anything about it

We so afraid, we fire away,
What's a life worth?!
We so afraid, repeat the mistake,
Just to come first!

We're the liars in the face of facts
A different weapon but the same attack
No I ain't throwing stones, no I ain't throwing stones!
Every lesson lost in the past
Pardon me but I don't wanna go back
No I ain't throwing stones, no I ain't throwing stones!

Think the boogieman 'll get me
Think different is the enemy
It's been this way for centuries
And I can't do anything about it
Can't wait to light the cannon ball
Can't face the mirror says it all
Sins of the fathers make us fall
And I can't do anything about it

We're so afraid, we fire away,
Just to come first!

We're the liars in the face of facts
A different weapon but the same attack
No I ain't throwing stones, no I ain't throwing stones!
Every lesson lost in the past
Pardon me but I don't wanna go back
No I ain't throwing stones,
Oh because I know I ain't standing alone

No, I ain't standing alone,
No, I ain't standing alone, oh yeah yeah
I ain't the only one who don't wanna throw stones!

We're the liars in the face of facts
A different weapon but the same attack
No I ain't throwing stones, no I ain't throwing stones!
Every lesson lost in the past
Pardon me but I don't wanna go back
No I ain't throwing stones, no I аin't throwing stoneѕ!
