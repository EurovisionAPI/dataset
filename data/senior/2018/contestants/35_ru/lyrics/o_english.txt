I Won't Break

My heart is in command
No longer in the dark
My castle in the sand
Is now made of stone and rock

The memory I knew
The things I've been through
And everything I do
Has got me living by the minute
And now that I'm in it
Now that I'm in it

I won't break
I won't break
When it comes to emotions
From the deepest of oceans
Coming straight from my heart
I won't give in to the motions

Those so called broken wings
Are soaring to the sky
I've flown with kings and queens
With freedom in their eyes

I won't break
I won't break
When it comes to emotions
From the deepest of oceans
Coming straight from my heart
I won't give in to the motions

Cause even in the darkness
Cause even in the darkest night
Cause even in the darkness
I can see a light
Cause even the darkness

I won't break
(Cause even in the darkness
Cause even in the darkest night
Cause even in the darkness
I can see a light)
I won't break
(Cause even in the darkness
My heart is in command
No longer in the dark)

I won't break
Cause even in the darkness
Cause even in the darkest night
Cause even in the darkness

My heart iѕ in command
No longer in the dаrk
