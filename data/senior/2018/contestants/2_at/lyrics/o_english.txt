Nobody But You

Lord I'm gonna get so high tonight
I'm gonna let the floodgates open wide
I'm in open water
This is what I need
And though I try to get you off my mind

And I get no sleep
I'm in too deep
I can't let you leave

It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
So am I wrong giving my all making you stay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto

Lord, I'm gonna bring you back tonight
Oh you're running circles round my mind
After your words have been my bible
How could I search for someone new?
When I really want you by my side

And I get no sleep
I'm in too deep
To let you leave

It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
So am I wrong giving my all making you stay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto

Don't make me tear my heart out
I'm shaking till I fall down
Don't make me tear my heart out
Don't make me tear my heart out
I'm shaking till I fall down
Don't make me tear my heart out

It wouldn't be right letting you go running away
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
So am I wrong giving my all making you ѕtay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you I cаn hold onto
Ain't nobody but you
