When We're Old

I know I'll never forget that day when first time we met
We've come a long way since then and I would do It all again
From your very first smile I knew that I'd walk a mile
See it's for real when you know you never want to let go

These are the reasons I want you to know (oh oh oh)
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons I can't let you go (oh oh oh)
Let's sing this song that we wrote
When we're old (oh oh oh)
When we're old (oh oh oh)

No matter what comes our way I feel like you're here to stay
You were there right from the start and let me inside your heart
After all this time, I hate the sound of goodbye
And if you leave I would…

These are the reasons I want you to know (oh oh oh)
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons I can't let you go (oh oh oh)
Let's sing this song that we wrote
When we're old (oh oh oh)
When we're old (oh oh oh)

Right from our very first kiss I knew it'll end up like thiѕ
I'm not afraid to grow old if I have your hаnd to hold
