Funny Girl

Ain't it funny, ain't it funny
Oh, it all started as a joke
But now I'm falling, now I'm falling
The punch line is getting old
Cause I've been keeping to myself
For way too long

Ain't it funny, ain't it funny
I made you laugh every time we spoke
I locked my heart in hesitation
But somehow, you cracked the code

I tore down my walls,
And wrecked the ceiling
Ready to bare it all, but

You're looking at her
She's looking at you
I'm falling apart
What can I do
To make you feel that way about me too?

And it's getting hard
I'm not gonna lie
To keep in the dark what I'm feeling inside
When you walk in smelling like her perfume
What was I thinking?
I'm just the funny girl to you

Can you feel me, can you feel me
Like a fire rising in the smoke?
Can you hear me, can you hear me
Open up with every note?
Cause I've been playing to myself
For way too long

Oh, I tore down my walls
And I wrecked the ceiling
Ready to bare it all
What was I thinking?

You're looking at her
She's looking at you
I'm falling apart
What can I do
To make you feel that way about me too?
And it's getting hard
I'm not gonna lie
To keep in the dark what I'm feeling inside
When you walk in smelling like her perfume
What was I thinking?
I'm just the funny girl to you

So tell me what you're looking for
I promise you, I got it all
What does it take to make you see I am right here?
And if you ever need to cry
I'll be the one who makes you laugh
Yeah, I'll be your funny girl
Your funny girl

You're looking at her
She's looking at you
I'm falling apart
What can I do
To make you feel that way about me too?
And it's getting hard
I'm not gonna lie
To keep in the dark what I'm feeling inside
When you walk in smelling like her perfume
What wаs I thinking?
I'm juѕt the funny girl to you
