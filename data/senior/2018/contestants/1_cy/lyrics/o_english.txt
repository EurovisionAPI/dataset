Take a dive
Into my eyes
Yeah the eyes of lioness
Feel the power 
They ain't lying

A little look
A little touch
You know the power of silence
Yeah keep it up keep it up

Till I got a doze of you 
You got me pelican fly fly flyin'

Coz I'm way up and I ain't comin' down, keep taking me higher 
Ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah yeah ah yeah ah yeah
Coz I'm burning up and I ain't coolin' down, yeah I got the the fire 
Ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah yeah ah yeah ah yeah
