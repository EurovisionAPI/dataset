Look at me, I'm a beautiful creature
I don't care 'bout your modern-time preachers
Welcome boys, too much noise, I will teach ya
Drum pam pa ooh, drum pam pa ooh

Hey, I think you forgot how to play
My teddy bear's running away
The Barbie got something to say: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
My 'Simon says' leave me alone
I'm taking my Pikachu home
You're stupid just like your smartphone

Wonder Woman don't you ever forget
You're divine and he's about to regret
He's a bucka-mhm-buck-buck-buck-mhm boy
Bucka-mhm-buck-buck-buck
I'm not your bucka-mhm-buck-mhm-buck-mhm

I'm not your toy (Not your toy)
You stupid boy (Stupid boy)
I'll take you down
I'll make you watch me
Dancing with my dolls
On the MadaBaka Beat
Not your toy (Kulului kululuu. Kulului kululuu)

Ah ah, ah ah, ani lo buba
Don't you go and play with me boy!
Ah ah, ah ah, ani lo buba
Don't you go and play… Shake!

(Kulului kululuu) Wedding bells ringing
(Kulului kululuu) Money man bling-bling
I don't care about your Stefa, baby
Drum pam pa ooh, drum pam pa ooh

Wonder Woman don't you ever forget
You're divine and he's about to regret
He's a bucka-mhm-buck-buck-buck-mhm boy
Bucka-mhm-buck-buck-buck
I'm not your bucka-mhm-buck-mhm-buck-mhm

I'm not your toy (Not your toy)
You stupid boy (Stupid boy)
I'll take you down
I'll make you watch me
Dancing with my dolls
On the MadaBaka Beat

I'll t-t-t-take you now
W-w-w-with me now, boy

(I'm not your toy)
You stupid boy
I'll take you down
I'll make you watch me
Dancing with my dolls
On the MadaBaka Beat

(I'm not your toy) Look at me, I'm a beautiful creature
(You stupid boy) I don't care about your modern time preаcherѕ
(I'm not your toy) Not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, toy
I'm not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, toy
