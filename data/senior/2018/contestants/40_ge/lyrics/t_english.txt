For You

Day – be longer
And melt the snow
To warm up the one, who felt cold in the night
Shine for us 
Not for me
Make the heart feel joyful for the others happiness

The sun rises in time
To grant people warmness
And the earth keeps turning with love

Let understand the feelings of others, share with others
What is the heart, break into pieces to share with others
The wind will carry the rest away
You own only what you share

Day breaks the night
If I am by your side;
Something ends and there comes a new start
Kindness will live forever on the earth

For you
For love
For just one flash
We go on our way
All is yours, what you ѕhаre
