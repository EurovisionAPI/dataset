Yearning

A long wait, and fiery
A few steps beat like a heart tonight
I follow her rhythm
Two hands that guide feel the warmth
This yearning that burns doesn't know boundaries nor distance

Nothing in this world can explain this feeling
When two hearts unite and beat like one

I want to hush tonight lay in this bed
Where the divine dreams heal every wound
To see her portrait
Moments pass by, seconds don't forgive
Hours go but they can't stop the feeling, no

As by magic, the moon gazes our stares
It brings me your vision

Undried tear, enlighten this night
Resound today from the silent soul
Just a moment the pain stops me
This undried tear will drain one day
From the fiery kisses it dreamed
At that moment the pain will stop

Sweet this life, but it knows no boundaries
Sometimes it caresses us, sometimes it separates us
I have you far away
You make me fight when my powers have given out
I dream of you even when I am awake

As by magic, the moon gazes our stares
Our eyes meet again, even though it is a fantasy
I will give my life to you

Undried tear, enlighten this night
Resound today from the silent soul
Just a moment the pain stops me
This undried tear will drain one day
From the fiery kisses it dreamed
At that moment the pаin will ѕtop
