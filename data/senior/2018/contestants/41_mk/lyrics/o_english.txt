Come and take me
I can show you how it's done
Come and take me
When no one is around

Come and take me
I can show you how it's done
We'll be lost and we'll be

If you want me I can tell you
What it's all about
You're standing in the shadow
And wondering why
You're in the dark

I want a deeper, deeper love
I want you by my side
Just let me go deeper
(Go deeper) Go deeper

Come and take me
I can show you how it's done
Come and take me
When no one is around

Come and take me
I can show you how it's done
We'll be lost and we'll be found
We'll be lost and we'll be found
Found

Have you ever thought about it?
We went too far, now there's no way back
No way back
Have you ever thought about it?
We went too far, now there's no way back
No way

I wish you trust your intuitions
And let the the journey start
You're afraid that you might suffer
But trust me what you'll find
Will blow you're mind

I want a deeper, deeper love
I want you by my side
Just let me go deeper
Go deeper (Go deeper)

Come and take me
I can show you how it's done
Come and take me
When no one is around

Come and take me
I can show you how it's done
We'll be lost and we'll be found
We'll be lost and we'll be
Baby, you and I, we'll be lost and found

Have you ever thought about it?
We went too far, now there's no way back
No way back
Have you ever thought about it?
We went too far, now there's no way back
No way back

We'll be loѕt аnd we'll be
