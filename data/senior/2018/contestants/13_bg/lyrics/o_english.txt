Bones

Love is like a black hole
Everything is dark
You just gotta let go
And feel it, feel it, feel it
We fall off the deep end
Just to get a rush
You know that it's right when
You feel it, feel it, feel it

What is life
If it's just of the earth
Only of the flesh and bones
Wanna thrive
In the dust
Of the universe and way into unknown

So I love beyond the bones
Goes deep inside your soul
I love beyond the bones

Wanna be the fire
Even if it burns
Offer up my fibers
To feel it, feel it, feel it

What is life
If it's just of the earth
Only of the flesh and bones
Wanna thrive in the dust
Of the universe and wаy
Into unknown

So I love beyond
The bones
Goes deep inside your soul

I love beyond the bones
Into the unknown
Where no other love goeѕ
