Who We Are

Bullied, from the moment we were born
We were always on our own
No one ever said we should be proud
And embrace the fact we're standing out

For too long, we just played along
Always putting up a show
But that was then, look at us now
All we want is for them to know

We are who we are
And who we are is who we wanna be
We don't have to listen
'Cause all that counts is you and me

And we'll be rising where we fall
In the middle of the storm
We're standing tall, standing tall
And if they tell us why we're wrong
Then the love in our hearts
Will keep us strong

<i style="color:#789">Uh, listen up, listen up
It's me, Jenny B
What you get is what you see
And as for Jess over here, she's a special V.I.P
So you better listen carefully
If they dissin you on Twitter
Don't get sad, don't be bitter
Don't give up and be a quitter
Show em you're better
Hell no
If I say so
Get in your car, rev it up and be a star
Cause we know exactly who we are
Give it to them, Jess</i>

We are who we are
And who we are is who we wanna be
We don't have to listen
<i style="color:#789">Don't listen</i>
'Cause all that counts is you and me

And we'll be rising where we fall
<i style="color:#789">We keep getting up and dusting ourselves off</i>
In the middle of the storm
We're standing tall
<i style="color:#789">We won't doubt ourselves and we'll be calling their bluff</i>
Standing tall
<i style="color:#789">This is who we are</i>
And if they tell us why we're wrong
<i style="color:#789">And we'll keep marching onwards spreading the love</i>
Then the love in our hearts
Will keep us strong

They can make us silent
But in our hearts we'll never be

And we'll be rising where we fall
In the middle of the storm
We're standing tall, standing tall

And if they tell us why we're wrong
Then the love in our hearts
Will keep us strong
