Hey, hey brother
Do you remember when we were kids with no fear?
Hey, hey sister
Do you believe in the things we dreamt we'd discover?

I still have faith
I still believe in chasing rainbows

Storms don't last forever, forever, remember
We can hold our hands together
Through this storm, through this storm
Storms don't last forever, forever, remember
We can hold our hands together
Through this storm, through this storm

Hey, hey mother
Am I making you proud or could I do better?
Hey, hey father
There's weight on my shoulders but it's not over

I still have faith
I still believe in chasing rainbows

Storms don't last forever, forever, remember
We can hold our hands together
Through this storm, through this storm
Storms don't last forever, forever, remember
We can hold our hands together
Through this storm, through this storm

Spread your love, give all you got
Hold your head up, don't give up, no no
Hey, hey brother, don't give up

Storms don't last forever, forever, remember
We can hold our hands together
Through this storm, through this storm

Spread your love, give all you got
Hold your head up, don't give up, no no
Spread your love, give all you got
Hold your heаd up, through this ѕtorm
