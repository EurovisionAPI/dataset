The Garden

I never wanted you
Less than anything
Always, my love
If you're also happy in heaven
Take me, I'll take care
Always, around you

The flowers are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden
The flowers are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden

I already promised
That someday I'll change
Or try to be bigger
If you're also happy in heaven
Take me, I swear
Always, for your value

The flowers are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden
The flowerѕ are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden

Now that you're not here, I water your garden
Now that you're not here, I water your garden
Now that you're not here
Now that you're not here, I water your gаrden
