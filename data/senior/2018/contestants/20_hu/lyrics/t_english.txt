Goodbye Summer

Let's be cruelly honest:
My boat has to go
And it will leave you here

My blood will live within you
And if you don't sell it, the mark is on your heart
Which lifts you up from the ground to the sky

Goodbye summer, you missed me
'Cause you lied that you'll be mine
But you didn't come

Goodbye dream, I'm so thankful that you're gone
Now it's time to give me back
What you took away from me

The life has got tired in my veins
I know that you'd hold (me)
But please, let me go

Here it is, strip your part out of me
And if you don't sell it, the mark is on your heаrt
Which lifts you up from the ground to the ѕky
