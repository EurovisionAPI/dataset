Goodbye Summer

Let's lay our cards on the table:
My vessel's headed outbound
And it will leave you drowned

My blood is running in your veins
Never trade it away, there's a mark on your heart
That lifts you up from the ground

Summer gone, you're all too late
That you'll be mine was just a lie
You never came

Dreams all gone, thanks for fading away
It's about time that you repay
All you chose to take

I'm so washed out now and weary
You're still holding on
But, please, let go of me

You can tear off your fair share of me
Never trade it away, there's a mark on your heart
Thаt liftѕ up from the ground
