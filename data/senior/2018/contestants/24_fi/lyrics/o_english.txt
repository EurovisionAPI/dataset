Monsters

Closed my eyes
So I couldn't see it
Felt so numb
But now I'm ready to feel it

So tonight I'm making friends
With all the creatures
That are hiding there under my bed

I ain't gonna hold on
To these monsters anymore
Now I'm gonna let in all the light
Tear down the walls
At my worst I found my army strong
All the demons are gone
You can try and scare me now
But I ain't scared no more

I ain't scared no more
I ain't, I ain't
I ain't scared no more

It's my life
I'm ready to lead it
I'm gonna roll the dice
You better believe it

So tonight I'm making friends
With all the creatures
That are hiding there under my bed

I ain't gonna hold on
To these monsters anymore
Now I'm gonna let in all the light
Tear down the walls
At my worst I found my army strong
All the demons are gone
You can try and scare me now
But I ain't scared no more

I ain't, I ain't
I ain't scared no more

I ain't scared no more
I ain't, I ain't scared

I ain't gonna hold on
To these monsters anymore
Now I'm gonna let in all the light
Tear down the walls
At my worst I found my army strong
All the demons are gone
You can try and scare me now
But I ain't scared no more

I ain't, I ain't
I ain't scared no more
I ain't scared no more

I ain't, I ain't
I ain't ѕcаred no more
