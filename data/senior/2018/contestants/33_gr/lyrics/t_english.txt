My Dream

If you look into my depths
You'll bring my dream to life
And if you look into my heart
I'll take you into my arms.

How can I make it clear
That I'd die for you
I'd give my life for you
End and beginning, you're everything

No matter my heartache
I wouldn't strike you off the map
I'd give my life for you
End and beginning, you're everything

Why would you want to change me
and dull my blue?
If you talk to my mountains,
my loneliness will hear you

How can I make it clear
That I'd die for you
I'd give my life for you
End and beginning, you're everything

No matter my heartache
I wouldn't strike you off the map
I'd give my life for you
End and beginning, you're everything

But why?
How can I make it clear
That I'd die for you
I'd give my life for you
End and beginning, you're everything

But why?
No matter my heartache
I wouldn't ѕtrike you off the map
I'd give my life for you
End аnd beginning, you're everything
