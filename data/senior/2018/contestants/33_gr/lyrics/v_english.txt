Eternity

If you search in my deep ocean
I'll be waiting with devotion
If you show me what's inside you
I'll be standing right beside you

I'll never let you down
I would never run away from you
'Cause my heart will not give up on you
You're my endless sea, my eternity
In our darkest time
I will shine a light and carry you
'Cause my heart will not give up on you
You're my endless sea, my eternity

When you're lonely, I will guide you
If you're missing, I will find you
Set your heart free, turn your sky blue
And I'll be here to remind you

I'll never let you down
I would never run away from you
'Cause my heart will not give up on you
You're my endless sea, my eternity
In our darkest time
I will shine a light and carry you
'Cause my heart will not give up on you
You're my endless sea, my eternity

Eternity

I'll never let you down
I would never run away from you
'Cause my heart will not give up on you
You're my endless sea, my eternity (eternity)
In our darkest time
I will shine a light and carry you
'Cause my heart will not give up on you
You're my endless ѕeа, my eternity
