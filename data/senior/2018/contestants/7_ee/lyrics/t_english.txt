The Force

You know, in the night for me
There is a star
It lights up my way
Always
It is my guide
In the immensity
And will never leave me

Destiny's force
Makes me fly near
To the hour of happiness
Is it a dream or is it real?
Our closeness
That rises us on rosy wings of love

When I walk the path of life
Always carefree
I would like it to be a fairytale around us
Our love
Will be a guide to us
In the infinite
Always

Destiny's force
Makes me fly near
To the hour of happiness
Is it a dream or is it real?
Our closeness
Thаt rises us on rosy wingѕ of love
