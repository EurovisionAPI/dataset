Mercy

I was born this morning
My name is Mercy
On the open sea
Between two countries, Mercy

It was a long path, and my mother took it
She had me inside her skin, eight months and a half
Oh yes, eight months and a half

We left our home, it was the war
For sure she had a reason, there was nothing to lose
Oh no, nothing but life

I was born this morning
My name is Mercy
They offered me a hand
And I'm alive
I am all those children
Who were taken by the sea
I'll live a hundred thousand years
My name is Mercy

And there in front of our eyes, there was the enemy
A blue immensity, maybe infinite
But yes, we knew the price

Emerging from a wave, there's a friendly ship
It gave again its luck to our survival
It's there that I cried for the first time

I was born this morning
My name is Mercy
They offered me a hand
And I'm alive
I am all those children
Who were taken by the sea
I'll live a hundred thousand years
My name is Mercy

I was born this morning
My name iѕ Mercy

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you, thank you, I'm fine thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you, thank you, I'm fine thаnk you
