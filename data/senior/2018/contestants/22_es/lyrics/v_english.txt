Your Song

I never thought i could be
Here in heaven, so close to the sound of my dreams
You put my heart upside down
When your beautiful mind turns my life back around
Now I'm falling… Free, i'm falling

Feels like i'm dancing in bright, shining stars
Pulling you close is like touching the sky
Now i know how it feels to be loved and alive
Feels like i'm dancing in bright, shining stars, next to you

You make me feel nice and warm
With your voice and your smile, i could just sing along
Everything's perfect, it's love
Take my hand, take me home, and then show me the world

Feels like i'm dancing in bright, shining stars
Pulling you close is like touching the sky
Now i know how it feels to be loved and alive
Feels like i'm dancing in bright, shining stars

Now i'm falling… Free, i'm falling
Getting closer
To your song, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Feels like i'm dancing in bright, shining stars
Pulling you close is like touching the sky
Now i know how it feels to be loved and alive
Feels like i'm dancing in bright, shining stаrѕ, next to you
