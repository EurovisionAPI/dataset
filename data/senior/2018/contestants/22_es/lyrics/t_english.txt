Your Song

I never got to imagine
That traveling to the moon would be for real
You put everything upside down
When you kiss my forehead and I find out why
I can no longer.. make it up

I feel like dancing for the first time
You are the art that sweetens my skin
From my traveling mind that follows your feet
I feel like dancing for the first time by your side

I know in you I can find
That voice that shelters me when times are bad
Everything's perfect if you are
By my side creating a new city

I feel like dancing for the first time
You are the art that sweetens the skin
From my traveling mind that follows your feet
I feel like dancing for the first time, by your side

I can no longer make it up
I only want
Your song, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I feel like dancing for the first time
You are the art that sweetens the skin
From my traveling mind that follows your feet
I feel like dаncing for the first time by your ѕide
