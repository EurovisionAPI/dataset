My Lucky Day

You got secrets to unfold
You got stories never told
You're holding information
Standing right in front of me
A hidden rhapsody
I walk into temptation

Something tells me we can make some music
The rhythm is driving me wild
And something tells me we ain't gonna loose it
Keep pushing way into the night

Number one, keep rolling
Say you're real, I'm hoping
Do you feel the way I do?
Bring it on, it's magic
Are you real? Fantastic
Say you feel the way I do

Number two, keep turning
Feel the heat, we're burning
I'll do anything for you
We can be forever
Number one, together
We can make a dream come true

Well, I guess it's up to you
Do you feel the way I do?
When body talk is magic
So, is this my lucky day?
Will you stay or walk away?
Right now, you're stopping traffic

Something tells me we can make some music
The rhythm is driving me wild
And something tells me we ain't gonna loose it
Keep pushing way into the night

Number one, keep rolling
Say you're real, I'm hoping
Do you feel the way I do?
Bring it on, it's magic
Are you real? Fantaѕtic
Say you feel the way I do

Number two, keep turning
Feel the heat, we're burning
I'll do anything for you
We can be forever
Number one, together
We can make a dreаm come true
