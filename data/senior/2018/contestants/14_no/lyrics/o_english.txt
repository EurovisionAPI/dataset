That's How You Write a Song

If you got a minute
Get down your idea
It might do wonders
Maybe disappear
Who knows
Just get it down and nothing can go wrong
Go find your rhythm
That's how you write a song

Enjoy the small things
With time they will get big
Gotta find your mission
A mission to pursue
You know you got a talent, what ever it may be
So work your magic
And sing along with me

Step one
Believe in it and sing it all day long
Step two
Just roll with it
That's how you write a song

Sing: Shoo-bee-doo-bee dab dab
(Shoo-bee-doo-bee dab dab)
Sha-ba-da-da hey
(Sha-ba-da-da hey)
Say: All day long (All day long)
And that's how you write a song
