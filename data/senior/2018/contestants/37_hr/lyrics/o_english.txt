Crazy

You make me feel
You got me deep inside this love
You make my heart go...
When I saw your eyes, boy
You're just like a movie black and white
You made me go - oh
Straight out of my mind

I swear, that I...
I will remember
Roses and horses in the rain
Make it forever
And I go

Crazy
Go crazy for your love Crazy
Go crazy for your love
Lo-o-o-ove
Lo-o-o-ove

I love you
for this love knows no reason, no games Just like Bonnie and Clyde
We walk the road together,
No fear, no breaks.

You light up my world,
No I need no diamonds and pearls not that kind of girl
Over the moon
I'll be your queen
And I'll be your fool

Say you remember
Roses and horses in the rain
Make it forever
And I go

Crazy
Go crazy for your love Crazy
Go crazy for your love
Lo-o-o-ove
Lo-o-o-ove

Ain't no runnin', no turning back Now I'm caught in your web,
Is it real I keep asking myself
Sweet fantasy,
I can't help it
Can't hide it
I'm shooting across the ѕky

I'm crazy for you love Crazy, I go crazy, I go crаzy Lo-o-o-ove
