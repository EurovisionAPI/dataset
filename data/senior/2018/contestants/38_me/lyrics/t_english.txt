Frost

Frost has formed between us
Blood in our veins freezes thus
Your heart is a dying ember
So you no longer remember

Love quivers like a tender leaf
Frozen in summer,defying belief,
I tremble too, all the way through
Since we were parted, me and you

In vain the quilt warms my bodywhole
A colddraught blows right through my soul

The days drag by as in a dream
Even when I win, I lose, it seems
But when no one is there to see
My heart will bid you visit me

I live my life by wornroutine
Like a slavealone, unseen
But when no oneis there to hear
My heart rejoices with a cheer

Me and life - like dog and cat
The heart the most treasured pet

The days drag by as in a dream
Even when I win, I lose, it seems
But when no one is there to see
My heart will bid you visit me

I live my life by worn routine
Like a slave alone, unseen
But when no one is there to hear
My heart rejoices with a cheer
