Dance You Off

I see that look in your eyes
but I ain't feeling no pressure
Feels like I'm stuck here in time
While I've been trying to forget ya

Just wanna da da dance you off
So. don't you da da dare wait up
'Cause I just wanna feel the mood
Girl with anyone but you
And I might now
Yeah I might now

Just trying to have myself a time
So, I just don't care if you mind
'Cause I just wanna feel the mood
Girl with anyone but you
And I might now
Yeah I might now

Treating you good we were gold
I dug you like you were treasure
So, don't act like I'm the cruel one
When I know you know better

And I
Oh, I used to think that you were worth the best in life
'Cause I loved it, I loved it
Feels like I'm stuck here in time
While I've been trying to forget ya

Just wanna da da dance you off
So, don't you da da dare wait up
'Cause I just wanna feel the mood
Girl with anyone but you
And I might now
Yeah I might now

Just trying to have myself a time
So, I just don't care if you mind
'Cause I just wanna feel the mood
Girl with anyone but you
And I might now
Yeah I might now
