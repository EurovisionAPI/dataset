Taboo

In the silence, you'll find gold
Where you feel warmth, I feel so cold
Can't get no sleep I'm up till dawn
These demons have broken my goal

And I know and I know and I know that you see my life, in foreign eyes
And I know and I know and I know that you hear my cry, tears tell no lie

Let our guards down
It's time to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals
Echoes in my head
Gotta break the taboo
No, we will never be criminals, criminals
But sticks and stones
Won't break my soul
Gotta be your own miracle, miracle
It's in my bones
Gotta break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals

I know that I am not alone
Let all our thoughts and ghosts unfold
In the darkness, I've found home
But what is next is still unknown

And I know and I know and I know that you hear my cry, tears tell no lie

Let our guards down
It's time to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals
Echoes in my head
Gotta break the taboo
No, we will never be criminals, criminals
But sticks and stones
Won't break my soul
Gotta be your own miracle, miracle
It's in my bones
Gotta break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals

Break the taboo
Break the taboo
Break the taboo

Let our guards down
It's time to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals
Echoes in my head
Gotta break the taboo
No, we will never be criminals, criminals
But sticks and stones
Won't break my soul
Gotta be your own miracle, miracle
It's in my bones
Gotta break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animаlѕ
