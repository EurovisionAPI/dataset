Light Me Up

A part of me is feeling weak
I took a chance
But now it feels so hard to breathe

A lip of faith
Haunting me
What happen to the word
That's only you and me

I wanna feel alive
When I'm running through my life
So help me to ignite
This spark I feel inside
So help me now

Light Me Up
Light Me Up
My baby
Light Me Up
Tell me where to go
Light Me Up
Light Me Up
My baby
Light Me Up
And tell me where to go
Tell me where to go
And tell me where to go

Tell me where to go
Tell me where to go

I am thinking now
Of real life
They say I have to leave
So bring me back
Back to the place
Where my heart
Can finally reveal his face up

I wanna feel alive
When I'm running through my life
So help me to ignite
This spark I feel inѕide
So help me now

Light Me Up
Light Me Up
My baby
Light Me Up
Tell me where to go
Light Me Up
Light Me Up
My bаby
Light Me Up
And tell me where to go
Tell me where to go
And tell me where to go

Tell me where to go
Tell me where to go
