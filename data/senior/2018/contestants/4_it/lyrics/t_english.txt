You did nothing to me

They don't know what time it is in Cairo now
The sun on La Rambla isn't the same today
In France, there's a concert, people having fun
Someone sings loudly, someone screams "Death"

In London it always rains, but today it isn't painful
The sky makes no exception, even for a funeral
In Nice, the sea is red with fire and shame
Of people on asphalt and blood in the sewer

And this enormous body that we call Earth
Wounded to its core from Asia to England
Galaxies of people lost in space
But the most important space is that of a hug

Of mothers without children, children without fathers
Enlightened faces, like walls without pictures
Minutes of silence, broken by a voice
"You did nothing to me"

You did nothing to me
You didn't take anything from me
This is my life that continues
Beyond everything, beyond people

You did nothing to me
You didn't gain anything
Because there's more
Than your pointless wars

Some people cross themselves, some pray on rugs
Churches and mosques, imams and all the priests
Separate entrances to the same house
Billions of people hoping for something

Arms without hands, faces without names
Let's swap our skins, we're all human in the end
Because our lives are not a point of view
And a pacifist bomb doesn't exist

You did nothing to me
You didn't take anything from me
This is my life that continues
Beyond everything, beyond people

You did nothing to me
You didn't gain anything
Because there's more
Than your pointless wars
Your pointless wars

Skyscrapers and subways fall
The walls of conflict raised for bread
But against every terror that obstructs the path
The world stands up again with the smile of a child
With the smile of a child
With the smile of a child

You did nothing to me
You didn't gain anything
Because there's more
Than your pointless wars

You did nothing to me
Your pointless wars
You didn't take anything from me
Your pointless wars
You did nothing to me
Your pointless wars
You didn't gain anything
Your pointless wars

I know that everything won't come back
Happinesѕ flew
It floated away, like а bubble
