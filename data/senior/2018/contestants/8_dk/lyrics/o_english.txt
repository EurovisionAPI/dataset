Higher Ground

Ships in the making
Bound for a distant shore
World for the taking
Man gone forever more
Boarding and setting sail
Yet victory won't prevail

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make you mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground
(Leap to land on higher ground)

(Taka stökk til hærri jörð, taka)
(Taka stökk til hærri jörð, taka)

Call in, surrender
Still I won't feel like defeat
Man laying down their swords
Each of their own accord

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make you mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground
Raise the banner to the sky
Face the fear and hold your head up high

Oh oh oh…
Take the leap like you were bound for higher ground

(Taka stökk til hærri jörð, taka)
(Taka stökk til hærri jörð, taka)

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make you mark and leave it hanging there

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make you mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground
Be the firѕt to turn around
Take the leap and lаnd on higher ground
