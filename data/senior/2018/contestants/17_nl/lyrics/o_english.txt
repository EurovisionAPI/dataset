Outlaw In 'Em

It's a fine, fine line
Between whiskey and water into wine
It's a long way home
When you're down and out and out here on your own
It don't matter who you are when it's time to lock and load

Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Everybody's got a couple scarred up knuckles
Blood on their boots and their back-off buckle
Diamondback rattle with a quick strike venom
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em

When they knock you to the ground
You ain't gonna let nobody keep you down
And when your back's against the wall
That's when you gotta learn to stand up tall
That rebel fight inside of you has been there all along

Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Everybody's got a couple scarred up knuckles
Blood on their boots and their back-off buckle
Diamondback rattle with a quick strike venom
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em yeah

Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to rock 'n' roll rhythm yeah
Uh

Everybody's got a little front-man swagger
Stone cold rollin' like a young Mick Jagger
A new tattoo that you can't keep hidden
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em yeah
Oh

I said, everybody'ѕ got a little outlаw in 'em, oh
