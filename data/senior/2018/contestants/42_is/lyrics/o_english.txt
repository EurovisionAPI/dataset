Our Choice

All the faces you see on your way
Have a story they could tell
Tiny traces of life's joy and sorrow
Why can't we treat each other well

We all have a choice we can make
There's always a choice we can make
To help and to heal in different ways
Too many are dying in vain
Together we could ease the pain
If somehow we could ease the pain

In every single language
There's a word for love and for blame
Different voices, cultures and people and places
Inside we're all the same

We all have a choice we can make
There's always a choice we can make
To help and to heal in different ways
Too many are dying in vain
Together we could ease the pain
If somehow we could ease the pain

We've only got each other now
Don't walk away and play pretend
It might as well be you
Who's suffering tonight

We all have a choice we can make
There's always a choice we can make
To help and to heal in different ways
Too many are dying in vain
Together we could ease the pain
If somehow we could eaѕe the pain
Together we could make a chаnge
