Goodbye

It's time
For me to say goodbye
It's fine
I've tried a million times
To kiss
The emptiness
And make her mine

I should've stayed
But I already left a thousand times
I've won my fights
Nobody new nothin' about
All alone
Trapped in a void
Can't see the light
Goodbye

Why don't you see the beauty that surrounds you everywhere
Why can't you feel the joy in all the small things people share
And all the happiness that by the way is all for free
Open your heart, receive the love and stay with me

Please
Don't be afraid
I hear your cry
Don't cry

We should all see the beauty of the precious gifts we have
'Cause everyone deserves the power to go straight ahead

Never give up, don't hit the floor, don't trust in all the lies
No matter what the odds will bring you, please don't ѕаy goodbye
