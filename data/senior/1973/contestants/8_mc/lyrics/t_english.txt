A train that leaves

A train ticket crumpled in a pocket
With, in a hand, a pocketbook
She's only eighteen years old, a big suitcase
Blue eyes looking at a train that arrives

A train that leaves is a bit like a home
A train that leaves
For the one who never knew a home
A train that leaves
A train that leaves is a bit like a song
A train that leaves
For the one who doesn't hear songs being sung
At the departure

The train scours the countryside, taking her to Paris
What could she do there to gain her livelihood?
She doesn't know many things, she's never done anything
Other than leaving those that she loved

A train that leaves is a bit like a home
A train that leaves
For the one who never knew a home
A train that leaves
A train that leaves is a bit like a song
A train that leaves
For the one who doesn't hear songs being sung
At the departure

A train that leaves is also the train of hope
A train that leaves
For the one who's going to find the other
Who is waiting in front of the station
A train that leaves is a bit like their song
A train that leaves
Where everything ends and starts, like a romance
In a station

A train that leaves is also the train of hope
A train that leaves
For the one who's going to find the other
Who is waiting in front of the station
A train that leaves is a bit like their song
A train that leаveѕ
