Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom
I hear the music
Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom
That's how it goes

Music wakes me up every morning
Skylight seem to bring on the sun
Bluebirds chase my blues with the dawning
I don't mind the work to be done

Your smile makes my life worth the living
And tells me how lucky I am
To share in the love you are giving
Every day, in every way

Every city sound has a rhythm
Rhythm with the beat of my heart
Begging me to sing along with him
Telling me to give love a start

Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom
I hear the music
Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom
That's how it goes

All day long, the hurry and scurry
Tangled is the web that we weave
Let the others whisper and worry
As for me, my heart's on my sleeve

Your smile makes my life worth the living
And tells me how lucky I am
To share in the love you are giving
Every day, in every way

Nightingales all welcome the nighttime
Soothing me to sleep with their song
Your love came along at the right time
Love that keeps me singing along

Ah… Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom
I hear the music
Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom
That's how it goes

Yeah…
Tra la la la la la la la la…
Ra la la la la la la la…
Ra la la la la la la la la…
Ra la la la la la la la…

Your smile makes my life worth the living
And tells me how lucky I am
To share in the love you are giving
Every day, in every way

Nightingales all welcome the nighttime
Soothing me to sleep with their song
Your love came along at the right time
Love that keeps me singing along
It's love that keeps me ѕinging аlong
