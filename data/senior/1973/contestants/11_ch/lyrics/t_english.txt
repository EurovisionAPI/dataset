I'm going to marry, Marie

My friends, my good friends, I've got you together
We're going to drown ourselves in champagne and whisky
Go like a spinning top
We'll laugh and sing the whole night long
And then, tomorrow morning, I'll go to the town hall
Go like a spinning top, go like a spinning top

I'm going to marry, Marie
And say goodbye to Sophie, Marianne and Virginie
Oh, don't cry, Marie
Not more than you, Véronica and Rebecca
I renounce your caresses, your love, my sweet life

I'm going to marry, Roger
And say goodbye to you, Frédéric and you, Didier
Don't make fun, Lucas
Not more than you, Napoléon, nor you, Colas
I renounce our feats, our crazy nights
And our youth which finishes today
Because I'm getting married

Tomorrow it'll be good time
To think about life, to make children
To invest my savings
Go like a spinning top
Tomorrow I'll be in prison
You won't see me anymore
Let's drink on my health and for my lost freedom
Long live the bride, long live the bride

I'm going to marry, Marie
And say goodbye to Sophie, Marianne and Virginie
Oh, don't cry, Marie
Not more than you, Véronica and Rebecca
I renounce your caresses, your love, my sweet life

I'm going to marry, Marie
And say goodbye to you, Frédéric and you, Didier
Don't make fun, Lucas
Not more than you, Napoléon, nor you, Colas
We have to remember that until the end of our life
And whatever may happen, we will remain friendѕ
Even if I'm getting married

Nana nana nа…
