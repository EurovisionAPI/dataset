Wonderful Dream

Just a boy and a girl
With a promise we'd always be true
We grew up all too soon
And discovered how little we knew

Would the dream leave the ground?
Was the future so sound?

You and I, we had a dream to fly
Wonderful dream, beautiful dream
Don't let it die

You and I, we had a dream to fly
Wonderful dream, beautiful dream
Don't let it die

Then one day, you were gone
And my dreams all came tumbling down
Childhood tears, broken years
Our true love can no longer be found

Though I'd waited so long
Still the dream lingerѕ on

You and I, we had a dream to fly
Wonderful dream, beautiful dream
Don't let it die

You and I, we had a dream to fly
Wonderful dream, beautiful dream
Don't let it die

You and I, we had a dream to fly
Wonderful dream, beautiful dreаm
Don't let it die…
Oh Lord, don't let it die…
