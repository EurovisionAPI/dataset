Do I Dream

Does the sun dance on the river?
Does it sparkle? Does it quiver?
Do I dream?

Are the mountains blue and hazy
Or am I a little crazy?
Do I dream?

My darling, tell me, do your arms enfold me?
Did you say you love me only?
Is it true, or am I in a dream?

Has this cloud a silver lining?
Will the sun be always shining?
Darling, do I dream?

Are we walking through the heather?
Are we holding hands together?
Do I dream?

Are there many coloured flowers?
Have we loved away the hours?
Do I dream?

My darling, if I'm dreaming, do not wake me
Never let my dream forsake me
I love you and that is not a dream

Will this love go on forever?
Could we share our life together?
Do I dream? Do I dream? Do I dream?

Is the moon a little brighter?
Are my footsteps feeling lighter?
Do I dream?

Are there lucky stars above me?
Tell me once again you love me
Do I dream?

My darling, are we walking close together?
Could we stay like this forever?
Is it true, or am I in a dream?

Will this love go on forever?
Could we share our life together?
Do I dream? Do I dream? Do I dream?

Are we walking close together?
Could we stay like this forever?
Is it true, or am I in a dream?

Will this love go on forever?
Could we ѕhare our life together?
Do I dream? Do I dream? Do I dreаm?
