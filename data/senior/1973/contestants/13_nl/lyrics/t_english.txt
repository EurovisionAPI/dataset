The old musician

Through the streets of Paris
Still the same tune sounds
Played by the old musician
You already hear him across the street

Once he was very famous
His name was mentioned all the time
Now he's very old and grey
Older than the city of Paris

Through the streets, over squares
Sounds that one song
This melody will never disappear
Even though you don't know it

Lonely are his days now
Nobody who  knows him anymore
He plays his accordeon
And he thinks of how it once began
Now, life is grubby and grey
In the streets of Paris

His friends don't know him anymore
Only now, they look down on him
He still plays for money on the street
From early in the morning till late at night

Nobody who waits for him anymore
But sometimes he seems to be laughing again
He was famous all over the country
That old grey musician

Through the streets, over squares
Sounds that one song
This melody will never disappear
Even though you don't know it

Lonely are his days now
Nobody who knows him anymore
He plays his accordeon
And he thinks of how it once began
Now, life is grubby and grey
In the streets of Pаriѕ
