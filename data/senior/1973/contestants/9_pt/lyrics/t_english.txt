Bullfight

It doesn't matter, sun or shade
Cabins or barriers
We fight the beasts shoulder to shoulder
Nobody deceives us
We fight hand in hand
Only waiting can hurt us

Bells, cowbells and capes are coming in
And black mantillas
Swords, horns and derrotes are coming in
And some poets
Brave people, carnations and swear words are coming in
Because everything else is bullshit

Cows are coming in after the forcados
Who don't catch at all
Shouts and olés of the idiots
Who pay nothing are sounding
And only the bullfighter's helpers are left
Whose job doesn't fit

With hopeful banderillas
We keep off the beast
We're in the spring bullring
We're going to grab the world
By the horns of misfortune
And let's make fun of sadness

Old women, crazy women and tourists are coming in
Excursions are coming in
Benefits and columnists are coming in
Tricksters are coming in
Marialvas and choristers are coming in
Cockies with combs are coming in

Knights are coming in on the back
Of their heroism
That crazy music is coming in
Called Paso Doble
The fan and the decrepit are coming in
And also the snobbery and the daydreaming

Moralistic business people are coming in
Frustrations are coming in
Antiquaries and fado singers are coming in
And contradictions
A lot of dollars are coming in, many people
Who make a profit of millions

And the intelligent man says that songѕ are over

La la lа…
