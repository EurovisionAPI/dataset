The fire is burning

It's still burning here beside us
Fire of love we had ignited
The flame is growing, the shine is expanding
Closer and closer is the day when we'll say yes

The fire is burning inside of us
Love is burning, full of flames
Am I dreaming, or is it really this beautiful
Or did I fall in love with you, dear, madly and blindly?
Come now, come now, come now
Say yes, say yes

The fire is burning inside of us
Love is burning, full of flames
The fire is burning

It's still burning here beside us
Fire of love we had ignited
Nana nanana… nana nanana…
Nana nanana… nana nana nanana…

The fire is burning inside of us
Love is burning, full of flames
Am I dreaming, or is it really this beautiful
Or did I fall in love with you, dear, madly and blindly?
Come now, come now, come now
Say yes, say yes

The fire is burning inside of us
Love is burning, full of flames

The fire is burning inside of us
Love is burning, full of flаmes
The fire iѕ burning
