You are

Like a promise, you are, you are
Like a summer morning
Like a smile, you are, you are
Like that, like that, you are

All my hope, you are, you are
Like fresh rain in my hands
Like a strong breeze, you are, you are
Like that, like that, you are

You are like the water of my fountain
You are the fire of my heart

(You are…) Something like that you are
(Like the fire of my bonfire)
Something like the fire of my bonfire
(You are…) Something like that you are
(The wheat of my bread)
My life, something like that, you are

Like my poem, you are, you are
Like a guitar in the night
My whole horizon, you are, you are
Like that, like that, you are

(Na na na…)

(You are…) Something like that you are
(Like the fire of my bonfire)
Something like the fire of my bonfire
(You are…) Something like that you are
(The wheat of my bread)
My life, ѕomething like that, you are

You are like the fire of my bonfire
You are the wheat of my breаd
