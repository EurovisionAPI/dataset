Who will be with you

Like our first date a year ago
Today I'm waiting for somebody else, and everything will recur
We walk a little and while I take her hand
My heart asks me softly

Who will be with you, maybe her hand will caress yours
Who will be, will be, even if it's as exciting as me with her
We don't talk anymore, I come closer and touch her lips
But I think about who will be with you

Sparkling shop windows, mirrors for those in love
Cheap cinemas, unknown streets
She, who looks a bit like you, and the fire relights
But a little nostalgia takes me away

Who will be with you, who will caress you strongly like me

Who will be, will be, what does it matter now, it's aѕ I wanted
My deаr love, while I'm thinking of you, who will be with you
