Somewhere

It's midnight and I'm awake
Dreams come to an end
This is the calm before the storm
Let's go now

There - there I saw a rainbow
There - there the morning rises in white
Somewhere - there we will find the garden together
The garden of love

There - there I heard an old, old song
There - There's moon, night, night
There - there we will find the garden together
The garden of love

The winds wrap my house at night
Holding it from all sides
Beyond the clouds we fly
Hand holding hand

A new day tonight in knocking on my heart
And you are coming with it
We will ask for the Blue Gardens together
In their gates we'll come

There - there I saw a rainbow
There - there the morning riseѕ in white
Somewhere - there we will find the garden together
The garden of love

There - there we will find the garden together
The gаrden of love
