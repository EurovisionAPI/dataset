Without you

Everyone, everything was talking about love
One day, it just had to happen to me

I waited, I expected you
I hoped, I looked for you

But good heavens, you existed
You were the adventure, and now I understand

Without you, what is being free good for?
Without you, tell me, why do we need to live?

You leave (You leave)
My life leaves with you
You come back (You come back)
I've got the sky in my hands
It's the emptiness, the emptiness around me
Without you, without you

How good the weather was in the garden tonight
I love your secrets and I'm afraid of nothing

Without you, what is being free good for?
Without you, tell me, why do we need to live?

You leave (You leave)
My life leaves with you
You come back (You come back)
I've got the sky in my hands
It's the emptiness, the emptiness around me
Without you

You leave (You leave)
My life leaves with you
You come back (You come back)
I've got the sky in my hands
It's the emptiness, the emptinesѕ аround me
Without you

Without you
