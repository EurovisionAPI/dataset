Young day

The darkness with its worries
Escapes from the day to the stars above
The first light calls out for the morning
And the sun rises

Young day, I ask you
What is your gift to me?
Are you bringing back tears from yesterday
Or new love and new happiness?

Turn around and show your face
Young day, don't let me down

Dreams are flying through time and space
And are still fighting the shadows of the night
But sunlight falls through the trees
And the earth awakes

Young day, I ask you
What is your gift to me?
Are you bringing back tears from yesterday
Or new love and new happiness?

Turn around and show your face
Young day, don't let me down

New day (New day)
What brings the wind (What brings the wind)
When a new light begins?
Is he bringing back tears from yesterday
Or new love and new happiness?

I ask you, please tell it to me
Young day, then I'll trust you
Young day, then I'll trust you
Young dаy, then I'll truѕt you
