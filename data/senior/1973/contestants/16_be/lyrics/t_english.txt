Baby, baby

Nai nanana… nanana na nana…
Oh… na nanana… nanana na nana…
Lala lala la…

Baby, baby – what's the matter now?
Just tell me, am I yours?
Tell me for another thousand times
Talk about love in every language

Love is fragile, it's just like china
Oh… breaks in your hand before it can be finished
Let's be together

Baby, baby, I love you
I love you, yes, my love
It's so lovely to be together
But the divorce doesn't hurt after all

Though, I know, a woman can't do anything alone
Oh… love only happens together with two
Let's be together

Sometimes love is nothing but a sore
Although you wanted that it could be different

Baby, baby – what's the matter now?
Just tell me, am I yours?
Tell me for another thousand times
Talk about love in every language

Baby, baby, I love you
I love you, yes, my love
It's so lovely to be together
But the divorce doeѕn't hurt after all

Nai nanana… nanana na nana…
Oh… na nanana… nanana na nana…
Lala lala lа…
