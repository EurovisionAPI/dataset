Get all up-
Set, it's a
Game, place your

It's a game of girl-and-boyness

Pour chercher la femme
Ne fais pas de drame
Ne dis pas "mon âme"
It's just a game

Game

Let's not build a castle
Cara querida mine

Give all you can give now
Live and give and play the
Game

So don't you upset her
Keep cool and you'll get her
Hey, cats can play house here
But who is playing the mouse here?
Oh, what a game
It's just a game
So it's no wrong
To sing this song
'Cause it has a moral
It's to love an not to quarrel

It's really much better

Keep cool and you'll get her

It's just a game

Quel jeu, mon Dieu
Mon Dieu, quel jeu
We're giving our all and just living and balling
O goeie genade

No, don't build a castle

Sag nur "Ich liebe dich"

O chérie
Klingt ja so schön für mich

Mark, now get

Make like a
Jet, 'cause this

'S a way to catch her
Come, darlin', mo chuisle
Come, mo chuisle , play the

Oh, what a game
Oui, oui, chéri

L'amour …
