Don't believe

If they told you that you have a good look
There is nothing to boast about
And instead of playing the good look
You should take advantage of it

Don't believe that all your life
You will be loved for your nice eyes
Because if your face makes other envious
It's because you're young and nothing better

Don't believe, don't believe
That you will be always a handsome boy
Don't believe, don't believe
That your youth will last

You will be like everybody
With faded colour
The belly as a globe
And all your teeth unset

When you will have your skull quite smooth
Clumsy gesture
And sidelong glance
You'll go to be repaired

Don't believe, don't believe
That you will always be a handsome boy
Don't believe, don't believe
That your youth will last

You think you're clever
To play the unfathomable
The untouchable
From the start until never in a month of Sundays

It's not serious
Hermes, Adonis, Hercules
Who stroll
Without thinking that one day they will get old

If they told you that you have a good look
There is nothing to boast about
And instead of playing the good look
You should take advantage of it

Don't believe that all your life
You will be loved for your nice eyes
Because if your face makes other envious
It's because you're young and nothing better

Don't believe, don't believe
That you will always be a handsome boy
Don't believe, don't believe
That your youth will last

Don't believe, don't believe
Don't believe that your youth will lаѕt
