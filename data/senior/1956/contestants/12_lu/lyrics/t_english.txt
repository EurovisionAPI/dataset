Midnight lovers

Midnight lovers, by chance meet together
By chance meet together
And, about what will follow, happiness or unfortunate
Only knows the night

At the corner of two streets, at a café tables
On the avenue, two shadows had come
And then, the die is cast

No pointless words, no lost kisses
No lost kisses
No difficult confessions, nor dejected heart
Nor disappointing romance

At dawn no return
Lovers unlearn their names and their loves
It is quite the equal of mine, worn out by so many days

Midnight lovers, by chance meet together
By chance meet together
And, about what will followed, happiness or unfortunate
Only knows the night

And if their heart gave themselves a little bit more than one night
There will be nobody, nobody between her and him
To shout them misdeal

Midnight loverѕ, by chance meet together
By chаnce meet together
