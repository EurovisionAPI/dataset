Open your windows

The first red rose has already blossomed
And sweet-smelling violets shyly come up
The first swallow is back by now
It's starting to whirl in the clear sky
It comes to announce nice weather

Open your windows to the newly born sun
It's spring, it's spring
Let a little fresh air in
With the smell of gardens and flowery meadows

Open your windows to new dreams
Beautiful little girls in love
It's maybe the most beautiful dream you dream
Tomorrow it will be happiness

In the sky, among the silver clouds
The moon has already set a date
Open your windows to the newly born sun
It's spring, the festival of love

La la la la la la la la la la la
Open your windows to the newly born sun

On the window-sill a small nightingale
With tender wings and soft feathers
Has already shyly flown up
And it's started tapping on the glass
It wants to bring its most beautiful message:

It's spring, it's spring

Open your windows to new dreams
To hope, to illusion
Let the last song in
It will softly go down into your heart

In the sky, among the silver clouds
The moon has already set a date
Open your windows to the new sun
It's spring, the festival of love

La la la la la la la la la la lа
Open your windows to the firѕt love
