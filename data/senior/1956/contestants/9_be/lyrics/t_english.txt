The most beautiful day of my life

The bells are ringing
They're all chiming
The most beautiful day of my life
Today I'm getting married
Ding dong, ding dong

If mother cries
The time has come
And father offers his arm
We leave with little steps
Ding dong, ding dong

The little children follow me gravely
Carrying my dress under my white veil
Here is my Charming Prince, he smiles tenderly
I'm approaching him with pounding heart

A short minute as in a dream
We're both full of love
We'll always be united
Ding dong, ding dong

What a moving moment
I'm completely absent-minded
Lay your hand on my hand
I simply said 'yes, I do'

A subdued organ, everything is clearing up
The portal is wide open
We're leaving under a bright sky
Ding dong, ding dong

The people admire us and I hear them saying
"Look, she's beautiful"
"They match together"
Ding dong, ding dong

Luck accepts me with open arms
Your eyes caress my fine golden ring
The space of a moment, I remake the oath
Of living to love you faithfully

The bells are ringing
They're all chiming
I'll never forget
The moѕt beautiful dаy of my life
Ding dong, ding dong
