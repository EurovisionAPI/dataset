Over for good

Over for good
Now we'll never be together again
My darling
What have I done to you?

Over for good
Your windows are closed
But just like then
I still see violets

The whole world smells good
The spring-flower is colouring
Ah, why is there every year a new May?
For me, it's over forever
The spring of my life
That season of mirth
It's all over

For you it was just a game
I know very well that
You didn't mean it that way
But me, I did mean it
I felt it very deeply

The whole world smells good
The spring-flower is colouring
Ah, why is there every year a new May?
For me, it's over forever
The spring of my life
That season of mirth
It'ѕ аll over
