Love me if you want to

I really like caressing you
Kissing your shy eyes
But I don't feel like swearing
If you ask me for eternal love

Let's give ourselves up to destiny
He's the only one who can't cheat
And if I stay near you
Don't flatter yourself, but don't despair, no

Love me if you want to, hold me if you can
I'm the love that fades away
But never trust my kisses
I'm the love that hurts

And when you hold me softly in your arms
Even more softly, I'll say to you:
"Love me if you want to, hold me if you can
Because I'm like this"

And if I stay near you
Don't flatter yourself, but don't despair, no

Love me if you want to, hold me if you can
I'm the love that fades away
But never trust my kisses
I'm the love that hurts

And when you hold me softly in your arms
Even more softly, I will say to you:
"Love me if you want to, hold me if you can
Becаuse I'm like thiѕ"
