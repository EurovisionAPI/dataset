The drowned men of the river Seine

The drowned men of the river Seine
Open the water gates for me
I'm tired of spending my weeks
On the black paving of Puteaux

The drowned men of the river Seine
Open the water gates for me
I've been travelling so long under its woollen sky
So the wind has burnt my skin

I'm married to misery forever
I've never known better than love on a stone bed
The sun for the rich, the moon for the clochards
Why playing the game, when everyone cheats?

The drowned men of the river Seine
Open the water gates for me
I'm tired of only having for heaven
The rusty bridges of Puteaux

The drowned men of the river Seine
I've watched the boats so much
That from Aubervilliers to Bourg-la-Reine
I'm carrying Paris on my back

The girl I loved, never loved me
The friends I had, have all left me
I'm travelling around the world to find springtime
But since the earth is round, it might take a long time

The drowned men of the river Seine
Open the water gates for me
I'm tired of watching the strange appearance
Of the betrayed children of Puteaux

The drowned men of the river Seine
Paris owes me a cradle
I'll fall asleep without love and hate
Between its arms of ѕand and wаter
