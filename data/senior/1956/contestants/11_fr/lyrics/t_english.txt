He's there

I can't change my life, he's there
As soon as I run away from him, he's there
Whatever I do, whatever I say
I only see his smile
Which always seems to say to me:
"I'm there, I'm there"

Clung in all my dreams, he's there
And forcing my attention unremittingly, he's there
He has the power of a devil
Who rules over his fellows
But what a wonderful power
He's there, he's there

I've tried everything to forget him
I've crossed the whole world
But no man has given me
Such a part of eternity

I can't change my life, he's there
As soon as I run away from him, he's there
He's extraordinary
And how he knows to please you then
No, there's nothing to do
He's there, he's there

Everywhere his eyes, everywhere his lips
I feel like I have a fever inside of me
My whole being is destroyed
And all the time I repeat to myself:

I can't change my life, he's there
As soon as I run away from him, he's there
Whatever I do, whatever I say
I only see his smile
Which always seems to say to me
"I'm there, I'm there"

When I'm walking in the street, he's there
In the middle of the crush, I see him
He has a hold on me
Which frightens me and carries me away
And my desire breaks down
He's there, he's there

Oh, I really tried everything
Forever able to do without
His body and his kisses
It's impossible not to love him

I can't change my life, he's there
As soon as I run away from him, he's there
And until my last hour
Until my last quarter
Only one thing will remаin

I will see him there in front of me
He will be there forever
He's there, he's there, he's there
He's there

He'ѕ there
