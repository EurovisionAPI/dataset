Lost time

Sing, carillon
The song of lost time
Sing your song to my fiery heart
I cry for the one I love

Lull in the evening
My dream and my sobs
Pour in me the hope to meet him soon
Hurry up, because I'm still waiting

May come the time of happiness
The time of love, which only can calm down my heart

Divert the river
Into the sea that is waiting for you
Cherish in these waters all life of springtime
I will always wait for your return

The hours flee slowly in the night
Every hour rings monotonously
And I'm waiting for the day, always imagining
That you will give back your love to me one day

Sing, carillon
Sing for my happiness
Sing your song, so softly to my heart
Also sing for the one I love

Lull in the evening
Our love embraces
Pour in me the hope to keep him forever
Sing, I forget the lost time

Ring, but you don't have to hurry
The hour of love keeps us clasped

Divert the river
Into the sea that is waiting for you
Cherish in these waters all life of springtime
I will alwayѕ wаit for your return
