I'm not yours anymore

Ah ah…
I don't need someone who tells me
Whether to walk on the road or where to turn off

And who are you, who judges me?
You don't need to try anymore, it's all over now
It's too late now to learn
You've lost me for too long, way too long

I'm not yours anymore, I'm not the one
Who has to suffer for being loved
I'll be mine forever, whether I'm bad or good
But for sure, I'll trust myself

I don't need someone (to tell me)
What I need, what I can do and what I can't do

And who are you, who judges me?
You don't need to try anymore, it's all over now
It's too late now to learn
You've lost me for too long, way too long, oh oh…

I'm not yours anymore, I'm not the one
Who has to suffer for being loved
I'll be mine forever, whether I'm bad or good
But for sure, I'll trust myself

And who are you, who judges me?
You don't need to try anymore, it's all over now
It's too late now to learn
You've lost me for too long, oh oh…

(I can't be your lover, what we had is over) 
(There must be another one for me) 
(I need someone, baby, to treat me like a lady) 
(Make me feel so heavenly) 

I can't be your lover, what we had is over 
There must be another one for me, aha… 
I need someone, baby, who'll treat me like a lady 
And make me feel so heavenly, feel so heavenly, ah ah… 
Feel ѕo heаvenly
