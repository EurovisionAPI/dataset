Hasta la vista

Don't try to deny
I can see in your eyes
All the love you'd like
To hide away

So don't cry, say goodbye
And go on with your lies
I know you are mine
You'll come back someday

Hasta la vista, baby
Baby, so long
Hasta la vista, baby
Oh go, you are so…

Hasta la vista, baby
Baby, so long
Hasta la vista, baby
Oh go, you are so wrong

Can't you see the signs?
I am yours, you are mine
You are sayin' goodbye
I know you are

Just try and rely
To the voice of your heart
Your tears in your eyes
Are so bright as stars

Hasta la vista, baby
Baby, so long
Hasta la vista, baby
Oh go, you are so wrong

You want to go
You say goodbye
You'd like to fly
Up to the sky

But I don't know (I don't know)
So tell me why (Tell me why)
You always cry (Cry)
Just tell me why

Hasta la vista…
(Hasta la vista)

Hasta la vista, baby
Baby, so long
Hasta la vista, baby
Oh go, you are so…

Hasta la vista, baby
Baby, so long
Hasta la vista, baby
Oh go, you are so wrong

Goodbye, you are so…
Hasta la vista
(Hasta la viѕtа…)
