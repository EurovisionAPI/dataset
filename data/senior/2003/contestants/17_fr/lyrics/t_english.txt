The moon and the stars

Lala lalala...
Lala lalala...
Nana nana...

Nothing is as before since we got lost
The rivers, the ocean, all the seas have fallen silent
And the earth, and the earth for me no longer turns
I examine the sky like a deluded angel

Oh my love
Where are you, my love?

I've known joy and then pain
I was with you, I'm homeless
I know I shouldn't talk about it anymore
At least try to forget a little

We promised each other the moon and the stars
Not a single rainy day, only sunshine
I know I shouldn't talk about it anymore
And I never ceased loving you

Yes, I know my heart which is now on the look-out
A memory, even an illusion, and all my blood rushes back
And the earth, and the earth for me no longer turns
I'm naked and without wings like a fallen angel

Oh my love
Where are you, my love?
Oh my love
Where are you, my love?

Lala lalala...
Lala lalala...
Lala lalala...
Nana nanana...

I've known joy and then pain
I was with you, I'm homeless
I know I shouldn't talk about it anymore
At least try to forget a little

We promised each other the moon and the stars
Not a single rainy day, only sunshine
I know I shouldn't talk about it anymore
At least try to forget a little

The moon and the stars
Only sunshine
Not to talk about it anymore
To forget a little

The moon and the stars
Only sunshine
Not to talk about it anymore
And I never ceаѕed loving you
