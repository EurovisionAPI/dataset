No borders - No borders

I wish I were an astronaut
Who looks down to the earth from up there
Because all those, who already were up there
They all say it's wonderful

Here you'll feel time slower passing by
Silence and peace that we miss so much
And here today it could also be this way
We're small, but not necessarily bad

No borders, no flags
From up there, the world is just beautiful
No countries, no nations
No wars can be seen from up there

Everyone should go there at least once
To realise this struggle doesn't make sense
Perhaps it will take our stupid megalomania
And instead of yapping, we begin to love

No borders, no flags
No stupid quarrels, no different races
No wars, no states
No wars can be seen from up there

Unlimited (Unlimited)
Peace without flags (Peace without flags)
From the height, borders can't be seen anymore
Unlimited (Unlimited), unusually
Without quarrels, explosions, rage and wars
From up there the world is juѕt beаutiful
