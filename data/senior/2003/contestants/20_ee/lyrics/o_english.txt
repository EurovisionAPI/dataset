Eighties coming back

You thought you had it coming
But now you really, really just don't know
It seems you make a deal far too big outta this

Aha, you thought that you'd done it
Yeah, you thought that you had heard it all
But the state of things is putting you down now
Just because, whoah…

You know they say it's just the eighties coming back
Can you feel it's the eighties coming back?
Yeah, I know it's just the eighties coming
Eighties coming, eighties coming
Eighties coming back

You said let's do it
Let's take it out and dance all night
But those deep synthesizer sounds freak you out
Whoah…

And now you wake up in the middle of the night
In terror, all you do is cry
Cold sweat, a cup of tea, no nothing seems to help you
Through the night, my God

Now, it feels just like the eighties coming back
Can you feel it's the eighties coming back?
Yeah, I know it's just the eighties coming
Eighties coming, eighties coming
Eighties coming back

Yeah, you thought you had it coming
But now it looks like you didn't know this
But everybody's wearing their hair
The way you did fifteen years ago
And it makes you wanna cry

Oh, it feels just like the eighties coming back
Can you feel it? It's the eighties coming back
Yeah, I know it's just the eighties coming
Eighties coming, eighties coming
