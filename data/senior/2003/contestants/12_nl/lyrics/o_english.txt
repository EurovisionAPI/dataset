One more night

One more night

There's a fire that burns within us
A flame that never dies
Like a river that runs right through me
A river, old and wise

A power that can't be stopped, oh no
If you're with the one you love
You'll never rise above
Being with the one you love

Give me one more night, give me one more day
And now and forever, baby come what may
Give me one more night, give me one more day
Well, let me hold you now and please stay, one more night

There's a bright light that shines upon us
A light as old as time
And there's a flower that keeps on growing
As long as we two rhyme

A power that can't be stopped, oh no
If you're with the one you love
(If you're with the one you love)
You'll never rise above
Being with the one you love

Give me one more night, give me one more day
And now and forever, baby come what may
Give me one more night, give me one more day
Well, let me hold you now and please stay, one more night

Take my hand and I will lead the way
We're all in need of a brighter day, yeah
Take a stand and it'll be okay
You're all I need, so don't delay
Come here and say, you're gonna stay

One more night, give me one more day
And now and forever, baby come what may

Give me one more night, give me one more day
Now and forever, baby come what may
Give me one more night, give me one more day
Well, let me hold you now and please stay, yeah…

(One more night, give me one more day)
(Now and forever, baby come what may)

Give me one more night, give me one more day
Well, let me hold you now
(Let me hold you now)
Please ѕtаy, one more night
