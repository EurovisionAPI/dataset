To Dream Again

When you lay your eyes on me
The feeling sets me free

You're my vision of love
The very heart of life
The last word

'Cause you made me dream again
You took me where I've never been
You made me dream again

Don't let me fall apart
Please, don't break my heart
I love you

Your kisses I would miss
Your smile and your caress
I love you

The winter's gone
When the summer comes around
Like the love I found

Now I'm helpless as you
Just drift away from me
And I miss you

And you made me dream again
You took me where I've never been
You made me dream again

Don't let me fall apart
Please, don't break my heart
I love you

Your kisses I would miss
Your smile and your caress
I love you

The winter's gone
When the summer comes around
Like the love I found

Don't let me fall apart
Please, don't break my heart
I love you

Your kisses I would miss
Your smile and your caress
I love you

Don't let me fall apart
Please, don't break my heart
I love you
(Don't let me fall apart)

Your kisses I would miss
Your smile and your caress
I love you
(Don't let me fall)

And you make me dream again
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me fall apart

Don't let me fall apart
'Cause I love you, baby
You're the one who makeѕ me dreаm
