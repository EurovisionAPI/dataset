Let's Get Happy

(Doob doo doobn da dap da…)
Whoah…

Last night in the discotheque
All my friends seemed to look and wait
Just lookin' for trouble
'Cause everything's drivin' 'em mad
(Yeah, drivin' 'em mad)

No fun, not a smilin' face
And down at heart in so many ways
Hey, baby, what's on?
And why's everyone so sad?

Let's get happy and let's be friends
For tomorrow never, never ends
And our world will be all new
Let's get happy and let's be gay
All our troubles, they will fade away
And the promise I will send you
Hits you on a brand new day

(Doob doo doobn da dap da…)
Yeah, yeah
(On that day, everything will be okay)

See the girl with the high heel shoes
I wanna know why she's got the blues
Don't ya stop a-rockin'
And get the ball a-rollin' tonight
(Yeah, get the ball a-rollin' tonight)

Everyone's kinda cool and stressed
Gotta move, or you'll miss the best
Whatever you do now
You just gotta do it right

Let's get happy and let's be friends
For tomorrow never, never ends
And our world will be all new
Let's get happy and let's be gay
All our troubles, they will fade away
And the promise I will send you
Hits you on a brand new day

(Doob doo doobn da dap da…)
On a brand new day
(Doob doo doobn da dap da…)
We will be on our way
(Doob doo doobn da dap da…)
And we'll have lots of fun together
(That's right)

Let's get happy and let's be friends
For tomorrow never, never ends
And our world will be all new
Let's get happy and let's be gay
All our troubles, they will fade away
And the promise I will send you
Hits you on a brand new day

(Let's stop feelin' sad and down)
(Let's just take off from the ground)
Whoah… let'ѕ get hаppy
