Let me dream (only one more time)

Take the sun, take the sea
Take with you the light of my moonlight
Take the dawning, from the sky take the colour
Leave the nightfall and my pain, and my pain

But when you go
Let me dream only one more time
And think you're going to stay always beside me
Make me believe only one more time
That I'm still everything to you

Take the air that I breathe
Leave my life without sense
Take my smile, my heart
Take my destiny in your hand, in your hand

So when you're gone
I'll keep the dream alive only one more day
Believe you're by my side, right here close to me
Help me to survive only one more day
Say I'm still the one, and I'll always be

And if time lingers on
In your arms will be the place I belong
Oh...

Keep the dream alive only one more day
Believe you're by my side, all I ever need
Help me to survive only one more day
Say I'm still the one, and I'll alwаyѕ be
