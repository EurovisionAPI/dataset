Never Let You Go

I don't know what I'm going through
Close my eyes, still see you inside
Everything reminds me of you
I could never let you go

I can't hide my feelings at all
I give you love, sometimes it's so hard
Without you I know why I would fall
I could never let you go

I would cry for you
And I'd lie for you
I would lay my life
On the line

I can't hide from you
Then I'd die for you
But I'd never let you go

What we share keeps me alive
For you there's nothing
I would deny
All I know is I want you so
I could never let you go

I would cry for you
And I'd lie for you
I would lay my life
On the line

I can't hide from you
Then I'd die for you
But I'd never let you go

(Cry for you)
Cry for you
(Cry…)

I would cry for you
And I'd lie for you
I would lay my life
On the line

I can't hide from you
Reаch the ѕky for you
But I'd never let you go
Never let you go
