Open Your Heart

Every time you close your eyes
I can see the light that you're hiding
Like a shadow in the sky
Of an eagle's wing when it's gliding

Don't be afraid, I'm not gonna run away
Don't let it wait, until it's too late
For what you have to say

Open your heart, show me the pain
It's all part of who you are
Tell me your dreams, your hopes and your fears
Just open your beating heart to me

Everything you share with me
Turns a little darkness into light
And that is how we're meant to be
Truth will keep the light shining brighter

Open your heart, show me the pain
It's all part of who you are
Tell me your dreams, your hopes and your fears
Just open your heart to me

Reach out, I'm right by your side
Exactly where I want to be
The sum of you and me is we, yeah

Open your heart, show me the pain
Show me who you are
Tell me your dreams, your hopes and your fears
Just open your heart to me

Open your heart, show me the pain
It's all part of who you are
Tell me your dreams, your hopes and your fears
Let go and just show me who you are, yeah
Hey… your heart

Let go and just ѕhow me who you аre
