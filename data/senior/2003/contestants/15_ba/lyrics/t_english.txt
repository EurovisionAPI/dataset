Don't worry

The day departs
You slowly follow it, alone
'Cause you will lose the game
This game I have known for long
(Down by the river where nobody goes)

Don't worry, don't worry about me
Lies can't hurt me
Say, say what it feels like
When everything is lost

You tell everyone that you don't suffer
That you don't love me, baby (Baby)
Now, fine, show me
That you can do without me

Because only two words
I have to tell you today:
At least (at least), at least (at least) for the end

Don't worry, don't worry about me
Lies can't hurt me
Say, say what it feels like
When everything is lost

Don't worry, don't worry about me
Lies can't hurt me
Say, say what it feels like
When everything is lost

I couldn't stand the lie 
Now you are doomed to cry 
Bye (bye), bye (don't ever), don't lie 

(Could it be, could it be, is it true?) 
(I was fool that could die for you) 
Tell me, tell me, can't you see? 
You'll never die for me 

Could it be, could it be, is it true? (Is it true?) 
I was fool that could die for you 
(You know that I could die for you) 
Tell me, tell me, can't you see? 
You'll never die for me 

Could it be, could it be, is it true? 
I was fool that could die for you 
Tell me, tell me, can't you see? 
You'll never die for me 

Tell me, tell me, cаn't you ѕee? 
You'll never die for me
