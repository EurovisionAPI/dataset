Feeling Alive

Give me your hand, give me your smile
Give me your kiss, baby, please just be mine
I need your love, I need you tonight
I've waited for you, baby, all of my life
All of my life

I'm feeling alive when you're looking at me
I'm feeling alive when you stand close to me
I'm feeling alive when you call out my name
Oh, please tell me, baby, that you feel the same

You make me feel so alive, I feel so alive

Give me a chance, give me some time
To prove to you, baby, I'm telling no lies
Don't play with my heart, don't play with my mind
I've waited for you, baby, all of my life
All of my life

I'm feeling alive when you're looking at me
I'm feeling alive when you stand close to me
I'm feeling alive when you call out my name
Oh, please tell me, baby, that you feel the same

You make me feel so alive, I feel so alive
I swear I'm telling no lies, I need you tonight
(Feeling… feeling…)

I'm feeling alive when you're looking at me
I'm feeling alive when you stand close to me
I'm feeling alive when you call out my name
So please tell me, baby, that you feel the same

I'm feeling alive when you're looking at me
(I'm feeling alive)
I'm feeling alive when you stand close to me
I'm feeling alive when you call out my name
(I'm feeling… I'm feeling alive)
So please tell me, baby, that you feel the same

I'm feeling alive when you're looking at me
(I feel so alive)
I'm feeling alive when you stand close to me
I'm feeling alive when you call out my name
(You call out my name)
So please tell me, baby, that you feel the ѕame

(Feeling… feeling аlive)
