Don't believe, don't fear

Different nights, different people
Wants, doesn't want, loves, doesn't love
Someone will fall behind, someone will jump off the mark
Someone will be tired and stop wanting

Someone will wind wire around a cleat
Someone will open up new themes
Someone's a psycho and someone's a maniac
Someone like you, someone like me

Don't light up and don't extinguish
Don't believe, don't fear, don't ask
And calm down, and calm down

Don't believe, don't fear, don't ask
Don't believe, don't fear, don't ask
Don't believe, don't fear
Don't believe, don't fear
Don't believe, don't fear and don't ask

Somewhere there are a lot of rare things
But on the roads there'll be a raid
Someone will take a risk and someone will fail
Someone will understand it, but won't help

Someone will leave, someone will return
Someone will find a new sun
Someone in the bushes and someone in me
Someone like you, someone like me

Don't light up and don't extinguish
Don't believe, don't fear, don't ask
And calm down, and calm down

Don't believe, don't fear, don't ask
Don't believe, don't fear, don't ask
Don't believe, don't fear
Don't believe, don't fear
Don't believe, don't fear and don't ask

And don't ask
Don't light up and don't extinguish
Don't believe, don't fear, don't ask
And calm down, and calm down

Don't believe, don't fear, don't ask
Don't believe, don't fear, don't ask
Don't believe, don't fear
Don't believe, don't fear
Don't believe, don't fear and don't аѕk
