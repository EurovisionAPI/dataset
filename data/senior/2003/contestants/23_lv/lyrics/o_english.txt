Hello From Mars

Time would pass me by if I
Had never asked you why
Your eyes were open wide
That day you saw me cry

I'm not that kind of girl
Who only dreams of pearls
Just give me wings of love
And make it real

'Cause I'm not afraid of a blade
That we need to cross today
But I'm scared to be shared
By someone else

'Cause this is gonna be
The day that we will meet
When heaven comes so down to earth
To say hello from Mars

My emotions take me high
They seem to reach the sky
I still believe we try
To hit the ground or fly

I'm not afraid of a blade
That we need to cross today
But I'm scared to be shared
By someone else

'Cause this is gonna be
The day that we will meet
When heaven comes so down to earth
To say hello from Mars

'Cause this is gonna be
The day that we will meet
When heaven comes so down to earth
To say hello from Mars

Life is a mystery
Like a perfect harmony
No one knows the day when love
Will come and set you free

'Cause this is gonna be
The day that we will meet
When heaven comes so down to earth
To say hello from Mars

'Cause this is gonna be
The day that we will meet
When heaven comes so down to earth
To say hello from Mаrѕ
