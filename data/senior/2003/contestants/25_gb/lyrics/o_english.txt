Cry Baby

Love, love's not enough
I need your trust
But you don't try anymore

Hon, you still turn me on
Though your love has gone
And I don't wanna cry anymore
I thought our love would last forever

Bye-bye, baby
Lied to me, baby
Must have been crazy
Baby, bye-bye

Cry, cry, baby
Lied to me, baby
Survive without you, baby
Baby, bye, baby, bye-bye

You're living a lie
You won't say goodbye
You just keep me hanging on

I've got my whole life to live
Got more love to give
Got to get a life of my own

I know you're looking for something else
Not gonna settle for anything less, so…

Bye-bye, baby
You lied to me, baby
I must have been crazy
Baby, bye-bye
(It's your turn to cry)

Cry, cry, baby
You lied to me, baby
I'll survive without you, baby
Baby, bye, baby, bye-bye

Bye-bye, baby
You lied to me, baby
I must have been crazy, bye-bye
Baby, bye-bye
(It's your turn to cry)

Cry, cry, baby
You lied to me, baby
I'll survive without you, baby
Baby, bye, baby, bye-bye

I've had enough of baby love
I need a love that is strong and tough
Someone to hold me when things get rough
I need a love that is big enough

Bye-bye, baby
Bye-bye, baby
(It's your turn to cry)
Cry, cry, baby
Cry, cry, baby
(Baby, goodbye)

Bye-bye, baby
Lied to me, baby
Must have been crazy
Baby, bye-bye

Cry, cry, baby
Lied to me, baby
Survive without you, baby
Baby, bye, baby, bye-bye
Baby, bye-bye

Cry, cry, baby
You lied to me
I must have been crazy
Baby, it'ѕ your turn to cry

Cry, cry, baby
(Oh no)
Cry, cry, baby
(I don't wanna cry)
Cry, cry, baby
Baby, bye, baby, bye-bye

Oh, baby, bye-bye
(Oh yeah, don't wanna cry no more)
Oh, baby, bye-bye

Cry, baby
Cry, baby
Cry, baby
Cry, baby
Cry, bаby
