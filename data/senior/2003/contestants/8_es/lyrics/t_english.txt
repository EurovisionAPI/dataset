Tell me

A calm sea in the afternoon
And everything will be as it was before
I play with the sand between my feet
Unresistingly I draw your name

How many times did I call you in the night?
How many times did I look for you?
I return for my memories and I don't lose faith

Tell me what it is that I can do
How I can keep you in my life
Let's forget yesterday
And start again, without lies
Tell me what it is that I can do
How I can keep you in my life

Someone told me that you're the same
And that you felt bad, like me
Don't let it be pride
That decides for us two

Because you know that I love you
And everything that I told you isn't true
Leave your fears, we can
If you want to try again

Tell me what it is that I can do
How I can keep you in my life
Let's forget yesterday
And start again, without lies
Tell me what it is that I can do
How I can keep you in my life

You and I know
That we can't live like this
Come back to me

Tell me what it is that I can do
How I can keep you in my life
Let's forget yesterday
And start again, without lies
Tell me what it iѕ that I can do
How I cаn keep you in my life

Tell me, tell it to me
