Words for love

(It's my way to say I want you) 
(I love you, I love you, I love you) 

There are a million words for love
Only I still can't find words that lead to you
I will search, I will check in every corner
Until I discover the right word

I will study languages, beautiful words
To say I love you in every language
I will find the word that lead to you, to love
(One, two, three, four) 

It's my way to say I want you 
I love you, I love you, I love you 
I love you , or simply I love you
It's my way to say I want you 
I love you, I love you, I love you 
I love you  and I love you
I love you

Yes, I'm such a romantic guy
Wooing you like in the films of Valentino
Seeking to find the word
That will erase all your question marks

I will study languages, beautiful words
To say I love you in every language
I will find the word that lead to you, to love
(One, two, three, four) 

It's my way to say I want you 
I love you, I love you, I love you 
Te amo , or simply I love you
It's my way to say I want you 
I love you, I love you, I love you 
I love you  and I love you
I love you

(It's my way to say I want you) 
(I love you, I love you, I love you) 
There are a million words for love
(It's my way to say I want you) 

It's my way to say I want you 
I love you, I love you, I love you 
I love you , or simply I love you
It's my way to say I want you 
I love you, I love you, I love you 
I love you  and I love you
I love you
