We've Got The World

She stands under moonlight
She touches her hair
Her smile lights emotions
And her love fills the air

And I know you're my every tomorrow
And I know that you'll always be there

We've got the world tonight (Tonight)
Let's hold on together
And we've got a love that's right (That's right)
So open your heart
'Cause we've got tonight

We move even closer
With hope in our eyes
'Cause love is the answer
To the hurt and the lies

And I know you're my every tomorrow
And I know that you'll always be there

We've got the world tonight (Tonight)
Let's hold on together
And we've got a love that's right (That's right)
So open your heart

We've got the world tonight (Tonight)
Let's hold on together
And we've got a love that's right (That's right)
So open your heart

Ask me why (Ask me why)
The sun and the moon go round
Ask me why (Ask me why)
My feet never touch the ground
(Tell the truth) Tell the truth
You take my breath away

We've got the world tonight

We've got the world tonight (Tonight)
Let's hold on together
And we've got a love that's right (That's right)
So open your heart
So open your heart

We've got the world tonight (Tonight)
Let's hold on together
Let's hold on together
And we've got a love that's right (That's right)
So open your heart
So open your heart

We've got the world tonight (Tonight)
Let's hold on together
Let's hold on together
'Cаuѕe we've got tonight
