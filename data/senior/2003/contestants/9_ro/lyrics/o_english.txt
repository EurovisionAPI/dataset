Don't Break My Heart

Have you ever known what the friends are for?
Have you ever listened to your heart and lie no more?
If you wanna count on me, I'd never let you down
But don't break my heart 'cause I don't wanna cry

Listen to your heart, you'll find your way
You gotta learn to live
Don't you understand, oh baby?
