Karma

God won't forgive me this!

Life like in fairytales had spoiled me
High in the sky like a star I was living
I was laughing like crazy when you were sobbing
Heartless, I was in love with myself

God won't forgive me this
The world fell on me
You left me, my friends left me
There's not even light

God won't forgive me this
I called you, but I don't have a voice
The tears gathered in my hand
Rusted they are

Because I was looking for you in empty hearts
And I could understand nothing entices me
Alone I am
Yes, alone I am

When I was sobbing, you were laughing like crazy
I deserved it to crawl
Guilty I am
Yes, guilty I am

God won't forgive me this
The world fell on me
You left me, my friends left me
There's not even light

God won't forgive me this
I called you, but I don't have a voice
The tears gathered in my hand
Ruѕted they аre
