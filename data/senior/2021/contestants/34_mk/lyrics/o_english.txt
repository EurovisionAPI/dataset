Here I Stand

There are times when I remember back
Wish to hug
The child about to crack
I'll tell him: Wait, you won't be long
Trust your heart and just stay strong

'Cause baby, they all tried to break us
Not knowing it's what makes us
This is how we found our way
Now here I stand
There's no pretend
My walls are down, my heart's in your hand
Unchain my wings
And the oceans of tears will fade to black
With the song of my years, ooh-ooh-ooh

They all tried to break us
Not knowing it's what makes us
This is how we found our way
<i style="color:#789">Here I stand</i>
My walls are down, my heart's in your hand
<i style="color:#789">They all tried to break us
Not knowing it's what makes us
This is how we found our way</i>

There are times when I remember back
And all I do is smile
All for you

<i style="color:#789">They all tried to break us
Not knowing it's what makes us
And this iѕ how we found our wаy</i>
