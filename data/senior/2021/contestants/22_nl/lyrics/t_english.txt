Birth Of A New Age

Skin as rich as the starlit night
<i style="color:#789">Your rhythm is rebellion, your rhythm is rebellion</i>
Deep currents running in the rivers of your eyes
<i style="color:#789">Your rhythm is rebellion, your rhythm is rebellion</i>
They spat on your crown and they poisoned your ground
<i style="color:#789">Your rhythm is rebellion, your rhythm is rebellion</i>
They burned your heroes at the stake
But your voice will echo all their names
This ain't the end, no
It's the birth of a new age

You can't break me
You can't break me
You can't break, break me
You can't break me
You can't break me
You can't break, break me

Soul blazin' like a hurricane
<i style="color:#789">Your rhythm is rebellion, your rhythm is rebellion</i>
Spirit roaring wild like untamed flames
<i style="color:#789">Your rhythm is rebellion, your rhythm is rebellion</i>
They buried your guts, they imprisoned your thoughts
<i style="color:#789">Your rhythm is rebellion, your rhythm is rebellion</i>
They tried to drain you off your faith
But you are the rage that melts the chains
This ain't the end, no
It's the birth of a new age

We are the fruit born in the legacy
Of every forgotten revolutionary
Born in reѕillience, proud like a lion
We are the birth of a new age

You can't break me
You can't break me
You can't break, break me
I'm half a cent
You can't break me
You can't break me
You can't break, break me
I'm half a cent
You can't break me
You can't break me
You can't break, break me
I'm half a cent
You can't break me
You can't break me
You can't break, break me
I'm half а cent
