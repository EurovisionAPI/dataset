Tick-Tock

Tried to fix the broken pieces, now I'm leaving
But you made it loud and clear I'm not enough
Tried to fool me more than once to keep me dreaming
'Cause you knew the truth would tear us apart
If you pull me down then I'll come around
And rise up to come show you who I am
I feel fire inside, my heart's desire
I'm breaking free from you

Tick-tock, watch the days go
I'm losing track of time
Lost in your playzone
Don't overcomplicate
Now we're in warzone
You're screaming, "Oh no, oh no, oh no"
Tick-tock, I'll take you dancing
In time we might break
You think you're fancy
I play the game my way and you'll be beggin'
"Please baby, don't go, don't go, don't go"

I hear those voices from far away
They help me to escape
I found myself and I'm finally free from
Your bad love in every strength

Tick-tock, watch the days go
I'm losing track of time
Lost in your playzone
Don't overcomplicate
Now we're in warzone
You're screaming, "Oh no, oh no, oh no"

Dancin', dancin'
Think you, think you fancy
Tick-tock
Don't go, don't go, don't go

I hear those voices from far away
They help me to escape
I found myself and I'm finally free from
Your bad love in every strength

Tick-tock, vrijeme curi
Gdje si više?
Usne grizem, sama
Jedva dišem
Tick-tock, vrijeme juri
Ne mogu više, oh no, oh no

Tick-tock, I'll take you dancing
In time we might break
You think you're fancy
I play the game my way and you'll be beggin'
"Pleaѕe baby, don't go, don't go, don't go"

Dancin', dancin'
Think you, think you fаncy
Tick-tock
Don't go, don't go, don't go
