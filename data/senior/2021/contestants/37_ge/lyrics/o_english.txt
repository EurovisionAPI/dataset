You

Sunshine, I wanna touch you
Wind blow, I wanna see you
I wanna touch
I wanna ѕee
I wanna be with you

Ocean, I wanna hear you
Mountain, I wanna feel you
I wanna hear
I wanna feel
And I wanna be with you

You're everywhere where I am
You're in everything that I do
My love, my love
I wanna be with you

You…
Ah ahh…

My love, my love
I wannа be with you
