Je me casse

Babe, are you hurtin'?
Are you alright?
You look like an angel that fell from the sky
And boy, you keep talkin', massagin' my ego
With your unoriginal pick-up lines
(Hell no, what you gonna do?)

Hell no, I am not your honey
Hell no, I don't want your money
Got it wrong, I ain't into dummies
Nuh-uh-uh-uh

So baby, it's not a maybe
Yeah, I'm too good to be true
But there's nothing in it for you
So, if I show some skin
Doesn't mean I'm giving in
Not your baby
(Je me casse)

Je me casse
If you don't get it
(Je me casse)
Je me casse
Je me casse
I'm not your baby

Boy, why you puttin' that drink in my hand?
Think if I'm drunk then I'll give you a chance?
Boy, you keep buying and complyin', so stop tryin'
Not gonna give it up and changin' my plans
(Hell no, what you gonna do?)

Hell no, I am not your honey
Hell no, I don't want your money
Got it wrong, I ain't into dummies
Nuh-uh-uh-uh

So baby, it's not a maybe
Yeah, I'm too good to be true
But there's nothing in it for you
So, if I show some skin
Doesn't mean I'm giving in
Not your baby
(Je me casse)

Je me casse
If you don't get it
(Je me casse)
Je me casse
Je, je me casse
I'm not your baby

Ladies, if you feel like flauntin' tonight
It's alright, it's alright
(Ladies) Ladies
(Listen to me)
Listen and go right ahead
Show you're shinin' bright
If you don't get it
If you, if you don't get it
(Je me casse)
If you don't get it
If you, if you
Excuse my French

Baby, it's not a maybe
Yeah, I'm too good to be true
But there's nothing in it for you
So, if I show some skin
Doesn't mean I'm giving in
Not your baby
(Je me casse)

Je, je, je me casѕe
I'm not your bаby
