Growing Up Is Getting Old

Playing Tetris with my feelings
Tryna keep them all inside
Hollow shadows and my soul is spilling over
I'm out of time, mmm-mmh
Closing every door, wanna be alone
Lonely is a way that I survive
Sick of wanting more, sitting on the floor
Wondering where all my feelings go

Nervous system's aching
Growing up is getting old

Don't get it
There's an ocean of emotion that I'm carrying inside
I am cautious
'Cause I've never understood how so much can fit in little me
Star-crossed soul
And I'm used to letting go
Sink deeper in the flow of it
My demons know exactly where my fears
Are hiding all my tears

I'm torn by nervous system's aching
Growing up is getting old
Anxiety is draining
Getting up is growing old

And if I ever take that second to leave my worries behind
Maybe I could tread the waters of time
Get out of my mind

And growing up is getting old
Growing up is getting old
Getting up is growing old

If your world is breaking
And growing up is getting old
Know that you're worth saving
And getting up iѕ аll you've got
