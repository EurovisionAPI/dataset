Practice on Each Other

Time has stopped
What is it, we're waiting for?
Your eyes say the same as mine
So I do
A dance move
I've practiced from home
And I pray to my maker, that they'll catch me

<i style="color:#789">A dancefloor</i>
Rivals trip up each other and make war
<i style="color:#789">On a, on a dancefloor</i>
But if you don't let go of me, we'll take off

No one knows how you do it, so
Let us practice on each other
Very soon we'll both be grown ups
You're the woman, I'm the man
All people on the floor have lost their minds
Let us practice on each other

Time has stopped
Your dress is light blue
You say something, I cannot hear, while the rhythm rolls

<i style="color:#789">On a dancefloor</i>
Where hearts swell up and break apart
<i style="color:#789">On a dance-, dancefloor</i>
We'll never be more alive than right now

No one knows how you do it, so
Let us practice on each other
Very soon we'll both be grown ups
You're the woman, I'm the man
All people on the floor have lost their minds
Let us practice on each other

<i style="color:#789">A dancefloor where hearts swell up and break apart
We'll never be more alive than right here and now</i>
All people on the floor have lost their minds
Let us practice on each other

No one knows how you do it, so
Let us practice on each other
Very soon we'll both be grown ups
You're the woman, I'm the man
All people on the floor have lost their minds
Let uѕ practice on eаch other
