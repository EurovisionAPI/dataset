Noise

Spring song, spring song
Where have you spent your winter?
In the garden, sitting on a maple tree
You've been spinning a shirt
There on the edge of the forest
An owl is blowing into the water
I'll sing a song
Let her hear it

Noise, get twined with periwinkle
I'm singing the spring song to you
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing hemp plants
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing green ones

Come spring, come
Don't wait around
We'll go outside
To love each other
Oh Spring, our miss
Look in our window
We had sang our song
And the sun shined on

Come on, come on, let's twine the noise
Twine the noise, dance it around
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing hemp plants
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing green ones
Noise, get twined, get twined
Noise, get spread with periwinkle
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing hemp plants
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing green ones

Spring song, spring song
Where have you spent your winter?
In the garden, sitting on a maple tree
You've been spinning a shirt
There on the edge of the forest
An owl is blowing into the water
I'll sing a song
Let her hear it

Noise, get twined with periwinkle
I'm singing the spring song to you
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing hemp plants
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing green ones
Come on, come on, we've made some noise
Made some noise and awoke the Spring
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing hemp plаnts
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing green oneѕ
