The Ride

Lights, beaming down the rainy street
All the faces that I meet tell me I'm wrong
Ride, staring at the neon signs
Making up a storyline, gotta hold on

Not lost, even in the death of night
I can make it out alright
Just let me go
Yeah I, I will make it through somehow
Let me figure out what is in and out

So baby, hold on for the ride of your life
High above ground, living it loud
I'm gonna take you to the end of the line
Taking that fight, make it alright
It doesn't matter if I stumble and fall
I'll make it through, I'll never touch the ground
So baby, hold on for the ride of your life
Hold on real tight, make it alright

Heart, I won't give my heart and soul
I am going for the glow, no looking back
I'm gonna rise high up in the atmosphere
I ain't got no time to fear
Follow my tracks

Not lost, following the neon lights
Shooting through the summer skies
Just let me go
Yeah I, I will make it through somehow
Let me figure out what is in and out

So baby, hold on for the ride of your life
High above ground, living it loud
I'm gonna take you to the end of the line
Taking that fight, make it alright
It doesn't matter if I stumble and fall
I'll make it through, I'll never touch the ground
So baby, hold on for the ride of your life
Hold on real tight, make it alright

I'm gonna take all the world tonight
Not gonna ask, gonna take what's mine
So hold on tight, baby, let's get high
High above the ground
Ride, staring at the neon signs
Let me figure out what is in and out

So baby, hold on for the ride of your life
High above ground, living it loud
I'm gonna take you to the end of the line
Taking that fight, make it alright
It doesn't matter if I ѕtumble and fall
I'll make it through, I'll never touch the ground
So baby, hold on for the ride of your life
Hold on real tight, make it аlright
