Amnesia

Once upon a time
I used to know a girl
Ripped jeans messy hair
Shining like a pearl
Like a summer day
She could push the night so far away

If you feel what I feel
See what I see
Don't bring yourself down
You are not alone, not alone now

Oh, I lost myself trying to have it all
This world feels in rush and they say they know it all
Oh, I lost myself trying to have it all
Self love amnesia, don't worry if it got ya
Cause you're not alone, not alone
I tried to fight it but it's getting strong, getting strong, getting strong
Oh, I lost myself trying to have it all
Self love amnesia, don't worry if you got it cause you're not alone

Giving all they want might make you lose control
They keep preaching words like I should know
People always say be careful what you're wishing for

If you feel what I feel
See what I see
Don't bring yourself down
You are not alone, not alone now

Oh, I lost myself trying to have it all
This world feels in rush and they say they know it all
Oh, I lost myself trying to have it all
Self love amnesia, don't worry if it got ya
Cause you're not alone, not alone
I tried to fight it but it's getting strong, getting strong, getting strong
Oh, I lost myself trying to have it all
Self love amnesia, don't worry if you got it cause you're not alone

Self love, it's never gone
Self love, put it back on
Self love, self love, you're not alone
Not alone, not alone
Self-love amnesia

Oh, I lost myself trying to have it all
This world feels in rush and they say they know it all
Oh, I lost myself trying to have it all
Self love amnesia, don't worry if it got ya
Cause you're not alone, not alone
I tried to fight it but it's getting strong, getting strong, getting strong
Oh, I lost myself trying to have it all
Self love amnesia, don't worry if you got it cauѕe you're not аlone
