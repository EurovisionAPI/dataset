The whole universe

Let the wind brush
His/her hand over my shoulder
The void in my head
Not a single place to hide

The dawn is fading
Behind a field of ruins
It's time to grow up
Don't hold yourself back

I see pieces of you behind us
And I see what pain has made of me

The whole universe
Our two hearts under the ground
At the centre of the rifts where everything explodes
Being at the point of impact
Without you

What will happen to our breaths
If they stay on the shore?
This love that wrings us out

I see pieces of you behind us
And I see what pain has made of me

The whole universe
Our two hearts under the ground
At the centre of the rifts where everything explodes
Being at the point of impact
Without you

Behind my eyelids
Get some air

The whole universe
Our two hearts under the ground
At the centre of the rifts and the aftershocks
We will meet at the point of impact
How can we heal our exploding heаrts
The whole univerѕe
