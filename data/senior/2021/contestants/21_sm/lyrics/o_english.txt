Adrenalina

I'm burning up with affliction
Come gimme your full attention
I want you to tame my fire now
Woah oh oh…
Can't move without your eyes on me
It's like my body's yours only
So baby, don't leave me lonely now
Woah oh oh…

We're like fire and gasoline
Come and light it up with me
So high on adrenaline
You're my adrenalina
Just one touch and I'll ignite
I'm a flame, I'm dynamite
So high on adrenaline
You're my adrenalina

Adrenalina

Oh-oh-oh, this place so fancy
Let's go and light up this city
You're close enough, but I need you closer
Woah oh oh…
You got me to this point, don't let go
No, I'm not leavin', not without you
You know, and you know I know, oh-oh
You know I know (Woah oh oh…)

We're like fire and gasoline
Come and light it up with me
So high on adrenaline
You're my adrenalina
Just one touch and I'll ignite
I'm a flame, I'm dynamite
So high on adrenaline
You're my adrenalina

Adrenalina
Flo Rida, Senhit, got adrenalina

Step in the party 'cause she know to do my body like hot coals
Gasoline, kerosene, stop, drop, roll
I can't blame it on the stove
911 when she comin' down the pole
Yeah, we like flames when we touch, can't get enough
We get ignited, so excited, you can feel the rush
Like cloud fire, more fire when we in the club
Put out my lighter, got the heat, she got me burnin' up
Woah, so hot, look at it steam up
We got the blaze, so we in inferno when we team up
Hot spot, hot girl, have you seen her?
We up in smoke, fireworks, adrenalina

Adrenalina
We're like fire and gasoline
Come and light it up with me
So high on adrenaline
You're my adrenalina (Adrenalina)
Just one touch and I'll ignite
I'm a flame, I'm dynamite
So high on adrenaline
You're my adrenalina

Adrenalina-na-na
Adrenalina

Juѕt one touch and I'll ignite
I'm a flame, I'm dynamite
So high on adrenaline
You're my adrenalinа
