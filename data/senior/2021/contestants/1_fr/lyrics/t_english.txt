Here I am

Listen to me
Me the half-singer
Talk about me
To your loves, to your friends
Tell them about this black eyed girl and her crazy dream
What I want is to write stories that reach you
That's all

Here it is, here it is, this is who I am
Here I am even though exposed I'm afraid, yes
Here I am in the noise and in the silence

Look at me, or at least what's left of it
Look at me, before I hate myself
What to tell you that another's lips won't tell you
It's not much but me all that I have I put it there, that's it

Here it is, here it is, this is who I am
Here I am even if stripped naked it's over
It's my face it's my cry, here I am, too bad
Here it is, here it is, here it is right here
Me, my dream, my desire, as I die of it, as I laugh at it
Here I am in the noise and in the silence

Don't go, I'm begging you stay a long time
It may not save me, no
But do without you, I don't know how
Love me as we love a friend who is gone forever
I want people to love me because I don't know how to like my outlines

Here it is, here it is, this is who I am
Here I am even if stripped naked it's over
Here I am in the noise and in the fury too
Look at me finally and my eyes and my hands
All I have is here, it's my face, it'ѕ my cry
Here I am, here I am, here I аm
Here, here, here, here

Here
