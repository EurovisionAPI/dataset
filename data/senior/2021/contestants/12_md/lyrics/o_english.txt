Sugar

I can't explain it but there's something going on
A crazy energy inside of me
First just a tingle, then it turned into a burn
Like fire in my blood

And now I hear my body talk, talk, talk
A taste is all, all I need
And I'm about to climb the walls
No way I'll be alone tonight

Come over, come over
I'm over doing without you
Come over, come over
Hey lover, give me some sugar

Got me addicted, so you can't take it away
Get me all satisfied

And now I hear my body talk, talk, talk
A taste is all, all I need
And I'm about to climb the walls
No way I'll be alone tonight

Come over, come over
I'm over doing without you
Come over, come over
Hey lover, give me some sugar

Just took a little kiss to show how I was missing out
Compared to you no one has anything to brag about
Your lips are hot and sweet, I feel it to my knees
Now I want only one, sugar, sugar on my tongue
I need your kisseѕ baby, gotta keep 'em coming

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
