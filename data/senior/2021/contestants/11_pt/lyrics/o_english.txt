Love Is On My Side

Left home when I was only sweet sixteen
Chasing blind love and a bunch of broken dreams
Don't know how I thought I'd be a queen
I could do anything
And somehow I end up here I don't know why
I still believe that

Love is on my side
Love is on my side
Love is on my side
Maybe not tonight

I can feel it when it rains
I can feel it still runnin' through my veins
Ran so fast I couldn't even grow
Forgot where I belong
Sold my body on a dirty cold floor
Yet I believe that
I believe that

Love is on my side
Love is on my side
Love is on my side
on my side
Maybe not tonight
Love is…
Love is…
Love is…
Love is on our ѕide
Mаybe not tonight
