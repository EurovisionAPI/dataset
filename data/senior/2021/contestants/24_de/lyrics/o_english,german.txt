I Don't Feel Hate

I don't feel hate
I just feel sorry
You feel so very clever whenever you find another way to wear me down
But I don't feel hate
I just feel sorry
So you can wiggle with that middle finger, it'll never wiggle back to you
'Cause I don't feel

Sorry

I really don't care, that you want to bash me
Do it with flair and I'll let you be
(I'll let you be common Eileen)
But don't you dare, mmm, to get angry
When you realize those words just don't hit me
What?

'Cause I don't feel hate
I just feel sorry
You feel so very clever whenever you find another way to wear me down
But I don't feel hate
I just feel sorry
So you can wiggle with that middle finger, it'll never wiggle back to you
'Cause I don't feel hate

Sorry

I really don't mind, to be your rival
'Cause for your kind it's essential for survival
(say what? He did not just say that)
Yes, I did, and I feel sorry
I don't feel hate, that's the whole point of this song
I guess you need patronization as some kind of validation
You won't cope with the frustration that your random me-fixation
Is another affirmation that you're just a hateful person
Who's not really better than me

Tap break, uh

I don't feel hate (don't feel hate)
I just feel sorry (I just feel sorry)
You feel so very clever whenever you find another way to wear me down
