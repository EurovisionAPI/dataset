Fallen Angel

What can I say?
I can't make her stay
When I know that she's so far above
How could she ever love someone like me?
She's out of reach

Here in the dark
Inside a hole in my heart
I'm fighting all of my demons tryna tear me apart
And I'm still not sure what you ever saw in me

No, I'm a, I'm a fallen angel
And no matter where my heart is
There's no way I'll ever reach up to heaven to you

She's so far out of this world
No way I could ever be with her
'Cause I know heaven's your home
That's where angels belong
And it wouldn't be fair
If I keep you down here

Here in the dark
Inside a hole in my heart
I'm fighting all of my demons tryna tear me apart
And I'm still not sure what you ever saw in me

No, I'm a, I'm a fallen angel
Tryna fly but I'm not able, oh-oh-oh-oh
And I need you to know
That it's okay to let me go
'Cause no matter where my heart is
There's no way I'll ever reach up to heaven to you

I'm a, I'm a fallen angel
Yeah, I'm a, I'm a fallen angel
And I'm still not sure what you ever saw in me

No, I'm a, I'm a fallen angel
Tryna fly but I'm not able
So, just let me go
'Cause no matter where my heart is
There'ѕ no way I'll ever reach up to heаven to you
