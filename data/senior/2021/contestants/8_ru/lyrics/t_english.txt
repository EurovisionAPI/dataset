Russian Woman

Fields, fields, fields, I'm so small
Fields, fields, fields, I'm too small
How do you cross a field through the fire?
How do you cross the field when you're alone?

Should I wait for a helpful hand?
Who will reach out for me, girls?

For ages now from night till dawn
From the deepest of the night
We are waiting for a ship
Waiting very much for a ship
Waiting for a ship
But what's the wait?
Stand up and go

Every Russian woman needs to know
You're strong enough, you're gonna break the wall
Every Russian woman needs to know
You are strong enough

What's the rattling about?
Hey, beauty
Are you waiting for your prince?
Hey, beauty
You're thirty, hello, where are your kids?
You are cute overall, but should lose some weight
Wear something longer, wear something shorter
You grew up without a father?
You should do what you don't want to
You sure you don't want to?
Don't want to, you should
Listen up, really, we're not a flock
Hey, crows, shoo

Now bear this in your mind
I don't blame you for one bit
But I just love myself more

They just fight, always fight
Go round and round to just fight
But never pray
Son with no father, daughter with no father
But this broken family can't break me

Every Russian woman needs to know
You're strong enough, you're gonna break the wall
Every Russian woman needs to know
You're strong enough

Hey, Russian woman
Don't be afraid, girl
You're strong enough, you're strong enough
Don't be afraid <i style="color:#789">Don't be afraid</i>
Don't be afraid <i style="color:#789">Don't be afraid</i>
Don't be afraid <i style="color:#789">Don't be afraid</i>
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

They just fight, always fight
Go round and round to just fight
But never pray
Son without a father, daughter with no father
But thiѕ broken family can't breаk me
