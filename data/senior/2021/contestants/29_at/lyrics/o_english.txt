Amen

Amen, I guess
You said that it's time for us to put
Our love to rest
Dressed in black, you left my neighborhood

No, I never thought you'd bury me and you
No, I never thought we'd die

But amen, amen
Tell me, is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?
Amen, amen
Tell me, is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?
Amen

I bet it's just another funeral to you
But for me it's the end
A marching band are playing gone too soon

No, I never thought you'd bury me and you
No, I never thought we'd die

But amen, amen
Tell me, is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?
Amen, amen
Tell me, is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?

'Cause it all feels like you didn't even try
Oh try, oh try, try to save us
All this time wasted on a lie

But amen, amen
Tell me, is this what you wanted?
Tell me, is thiѕ what you wanted?
Amen, amen, yeah
Are you getting what you wanted?
Are you getting what you wаnted?
Amen
