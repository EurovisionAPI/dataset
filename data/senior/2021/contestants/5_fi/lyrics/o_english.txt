Dark Side

Put your middle fingers up 
Take a shot 
Throw it up and don't stop 
I'm, I'm, I'm 
Living that life on the dark side

Every psycho in the scene 
Hands up and follow me saying 
Empire of the freaks 
All drinks on me

Just another night on my pitch black paradise 
Don't wanna cry so I gotta get paralyzed 
My body is my weapon so I keep it loaded 
'Til I'm all over the place like my head exploded

Don't waste your prayers 
They can't save us 
Lifestyles of the sick and dangerous

Put your middle fingers up 
Take a shot 
Throw it up and don't stop 
I'm, I'm, I'm 
Living that life on the dark side 
Like the 27 club 
Headshot 
We don't wanna grow up 
I'm, I'm, I'm 
Living that life on the dark side 
Life on the dark side

Every psycho in the scene 
Hands up and follow me saying 
Empire of the freaks 
All drinks on me

I'm in a cave of man-made misery 
Diggin' a grave for myself and my enemies 
Of all the dark things that keep me wasted 
You're the sweetest I've ever tasted

Put your middle fingers up 
Take a shot 
Throw it up and don't stop 
I'm, I'm, I'm 
Living that life on the dark side
Like the 27 club 
Headshot 
We don't wanna grow up 
I'm, I'm, I'm 
Living that life on the dark side 
Life on the dark side

Just another night on my pitch black paradise 
Don't wanna cry so I gotta get paralyzed

Don't waste your prayers 
They can't save us 
Lifestyles of the sick and dangerous

Put your middle fingers up 
Take a shot 
Throw it up and don't stop 
I'm, I'm, I'm 
Living that life on the dark side 
Like the 27 club 
Headshot 
We don't wanna grow up 
I'm, I'm, I'm 
Living that life on the dark side 
Life on the dark side

Every psycho in the scene 
Hands up and follow me saying 
Empire of the freаks 
All drinkѕ on me
