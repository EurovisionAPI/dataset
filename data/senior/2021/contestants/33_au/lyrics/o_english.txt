Technicolour

I wanna be close to my mother
I wanna belong to the world
A mirror that shows technicolour
I'll be a magnificent girl

But everything is frustrating
Everything moves along faster than I can relate to
But I got power, yeah
Midnight is the hour, yeah
Time to take off your cloaks

Techni-technicolour, techni-technicolour
If we stand together we can do whatever
Techni-technicolour, techni-technicolour
If we care for one another, we can

I wanna know that there's a future
That I can move myself towards
And yet, I promise you, yes, all you nasty dudes
I don't need certainty to get my pot of gold, no

Everything is frustrating
Everything moves along faster than I can relate to
But we got grace, yeah
We got style and lasers, yeah
Time to take off your cloaks

Techni-technicolour, techni-technicolour
If we stand together we can do whatever
Techni-technicolour, techni-technicolour
If we care for one another, we can

Shine, shine, shine, shine…

Techni-technicolour, techni-technicolour
If we stand together we can do whatever
Techni-technicolour, techni-technicolour
If we care for one another, we cаn ѕhine
