Amen

Hey child
Why ya hidin' from the light?
Why ya cowering in fright?
Don't tell yourself the Heavens cast you out
And you've fallen from grace
You'll get beaten and bruised
You'll be scarred unto your core
But it's gonna make you who you are
When ya learn to heal
When ya learn to rise again
You can tell the sun, "Amen"

Hallelujah
We're glorious
Hallelujah
The day is dawning
The storm's relentless
But everybody knows
Everybody knows we're born to the fight

Hey child
The fear will never go away
Might as well accept it now
Learn to persevere
Oh, learn to count your blessings down
Greet the future with, "Amen"

Hallelujah
We're glorious
Hallelujah
The day is dawning
The storm's relentless
But everybody knows
Everybody knows we're born to the fight

Not until the rain has stopped
Not until the thunder's hushed
Are we at rest?
Are we at peace? Just imagine it
Not until the storm has passed
Not until it's quiet
Can the heart that's broken cry

Hallelujah
We're glorious
(Hallelujah) Oh, yeah
The day is dawning
The storm's relentless
But everybody knows
Everybody knowѕ we're born to the fight

Hey child
Why yа hidin' from the light?
