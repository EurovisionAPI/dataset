Don't get mad, just gather some courage
A girl like me doesn't ask for promises
You cannot stop looking at me
I easily started running through your veins

Your smile is telling me
That you want me, so who are you kidding?
I'm sweet like a chocolate ice cream
Now you go be all Loco

Ram-ba-ba-bam
I'm sweet and nice
And you're all alone
And I know, know, know
That we're gonna tear this place down
So now you go be all Loco Loco

And I'm sweet and nice
And you're all alone
And I know, know, know
That we're gonna tear this place down
So now you go be all Loco Loco

<i style="color:#789">Be all Loco Loco</i>

Baby, baby, baby, why the drama?
A girl like me does not ask for promises
Baby, baby, baby, I'm dancing alone
The fact that you're not with me is your flaw

Your smile is telling me
That you want me, so who're you kidding?
I'm sweet like a chocolate ice cream
Now you go be all Loco

Ram-ba-ba-bam
I'm sweet and nice
And you're all alone
And I know, know, know
That we're gonna tear this place down
So now you go be all Loco Loco

And I'm sweet and nice
And you're all alone
And I know, know, know
That we're gonna tear this place down
So now you go be all Loco Loco

One, two, girls, come on!
