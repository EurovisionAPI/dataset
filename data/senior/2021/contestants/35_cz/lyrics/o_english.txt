Omaga

Honestly don't care
I'm happy you're here
Tryna make you smile for a while now
I'm like, "Omaga, you're so beautiful"
Why don't you come over and have it?
Why don't you let me have it? Oh

I did a lot of dumb shh
Lot of things I wish I didn't do, aye
Baby, come back, won't you?
Back, come back, he-ey
Oh, I'm crazy
Is it crazy to love you?
Baby, come back, won't you?
Back, come back

You said you're still too mad 'bout them things I did
But I don't know what I did, my baby, yeah
You said you again feel down, to blame apocalypse
There ain't no apocalypse
Long as you're here on my lips

Honestly don't care
I'm happy you're here
I'm tryna make you smile for a while now
I'm like, "Omaga, you're so beautiful"
Why don't you come over and have it?
Why don't you let me have it? Oh

You've been home too long
I've been home too long, yeah
We both need to feel love, nothing wrong with that
Můžeš bejt u mě klidně mužem dělat jakoby

There ain't no apocalypse
Long as you're here on my lips

Honestly don't care
