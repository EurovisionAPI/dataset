El Diablo

I fell in love, I fell in love
I gave my heart to el diablo, el diablo
I gave it up, I gave it up
Because he tells me I'm his angel, I'm his angel

Tonight we're gonna burn in the party
We wild as fire, were on the loseh
Hotter than siracha on our bodies
T-taco, temale, yeah, that's my mood
All this spice, it melts my icy edges
Baby, it's true
Tonight we're gonna burn in the party
It's Heaven and hell with you

Mama-mamacita, tell me what to do
Lo-la-lo-la-loca, I'm breaking the rules

I fell in love, I fell in love
I gave my heart to el diablo, el diablo
I gave it up, I gave it up
Because he tells me I'm his angel, I'm his angel
Oh-oh-oh, el diablo, el diablo
I fell in love, I fell in love
I gave my heart to el diablo, el diablo

Tonight we're gonna dance in the moonlight
Dripping my lashes on the floor
Hair flip-flip, made you look twice
Touch me, touch me, mi amor
All this spice, it melts my icy air
Baby, for sure
Tonight we're gonna dance in the moonlight
And then we're gonna do it some more

Mama-mamacita, tell me what to do
Lo-la-lo-la-loca, I'm breaking the rules

I fell in love, I fell in love
I gave my heart to el diablo, el diablo
I gave it up, I gave it up
Because he tells me I'm his angel, I'm his angel
Oh-oh-oh, el diablo, el diablo
I fell in love, I fell in love
I gave my heart to el diablo, el diablo

I love el diablo
I love el diablo
I love el diablo

I fell in love, I fell in love
I gave my heart to el diablo, el diablo
I gave it up, I gave it up
Because he tells me I'm his angel, I'm hiѕ angel
Oh-oh-oh, el diablo, el diablo, oh-oh
I fell in love, I fell in love
I gave my heart to el diablo, el diablo

I love el diablo
