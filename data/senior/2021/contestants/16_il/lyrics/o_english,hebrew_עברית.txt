Set Me Free

Take a look what we've become
It's been so long
Getting you out of my life
I feel so strong

Set me free
Feel my beating heart in perfect harmony
Don't let me down
I'ma I'ma Ah
I'ma I'ma Ah

Feeling like in prison
Looking for the reason
I don't wanna say goodbye
Feels like no tomorrow
Everywhere that I go
Babe I'm gonna lose my mind
Just another story
Tell me not to worry
And everything will be just fine
Used to be your treasure
Now I'm gone forever
Think I'm going back in time

Set me free
Feel my beating heart in perfect harmony
Don't let me down
I'ma I'ma Ah
I'ma make it on my own
I'ma I'ma Ah
חלאס עם השיגעון
I'ma I'ma Ah
I'ma make it on my own
I'ma I'ma Ah

Life has been so easy
Used to call us cheesy
It was paradise
In my bed so lonely
You're the one and only
Hell I know I paid my price
Clock is ticking tik tak
Everything is צ'יק צ'ק
And I don't know what to do
People tell me honey
יאללה בלאגנים
One day dreams will become true

Set me free
Feel my beating heart in perfect harmony
Don't let me down
Set me free
Feel my beating heart in perfect harmony
Don't let me down
I'ma I'ma Ah
I'ma make it on my own
I'ma I'ma Ah
חלאס עם השיגעון
I'ma I'ma Ah
I'ma make it on my own
I'ma I'ma Ah

I'm so awesome
Come and get some
What are we living for?
I'm your reason, spicy season
Like we did before
Let me take you higher
Set the place on fire
Twenty twenty-one degrees
Feel my beating heart and set me free

Set me Free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free hаrmony
Don't let me down
Just ѕet me free
