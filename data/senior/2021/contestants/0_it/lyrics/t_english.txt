Be quiet and behave

They don't know what I am talkin' about
Dirty clothes, bro, muddy clothes
Yellow 'cig stains on my finger
I am walkin' with my 'cig

Excuse me, but I truly believe
That I can make this jump
And even if the road is uphill
That's why I am training now

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
Bring out the actors
You'd better not make anymore mistakes
You'd better be quiet and behave
Around here, there are strange people-like dealers

Too many nights I've spent locked outside
Now I'm kicking these doors
Eyes up like climbers
So excuse me mum if I'm always out, but

I'm out of my mind, but different from them
And you are out of your mind, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them

I've written pages and pages
I've seen the salt then the tears
These machine-men
Not climbing the rapids

I've written on a tombstone
In my house there's no God
But if you find the sense of time
You'll climb out of your oblivion

And there's no wind stopping
The natural power
From the right point of view
You feel the thrill of the wind

With wax wings on my back
I'll seek that high
If you want to stop me try again
Try cutting my head off because

I'm out of my mind, but different from them
And you are out of your mind, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them

They talk, unfortunately people talk
They don't know what they talk about
You, bring me where I stay afloat
Cause here i can't breathe
They talk, unfortunately people talk
They don't know what they are talkin' about
You, bring me where I stay afloat
Cause here I can't breathe

They talk, unfortunately people talk
They don't know what they are talkin' about
You, bring me where I stay afloat
Cause here I can't breathe

But I'm out of my mind, but different from them
And you are out of your mind, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
We аre out of our mindѕ, but different from them

We're different from them
