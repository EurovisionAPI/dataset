The Moon Is Rising

The queen of the night is coming
The blood moon is rising

When I walk in like this with an attitude
You should know that I'm coming after you
You can run, you can hide
But you're mesmerized
In your mind I'm already idolized

Playing dirty, not my case
Giving up hopes, not my case
Being envious, not my case
If you got something to say
Say it to my face

The queen of the night is coming
The blood moon is rising

I will glow, I will burn, illuminate
Bring the passion inside
Let me touch your fate
I will lead, I will guide you on your way
I am here to remind you're in the right place

Playing dirty, not my case
Giving up hopes, not my case
Being envious, not my case
If you got something to say
Say it to my face

My rules, your rules
I'm a woman, I'm a ruler
Rules, your rules
I'm accepting only true love
Rules, your rules
I'm a woman, I'm a ruler
If you got something to say
Say it to my face

My rules, your rules
Getting ready for the parade
Rules, your rules
No excuses if it's too late
Rules, your rules
Everybody follow my way
If you got something to say
Say it to my face
