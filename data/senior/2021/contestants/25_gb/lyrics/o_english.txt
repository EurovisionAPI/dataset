Embers

Sometimes I know my fire burns low
But as long as you're with me I'll never get cold
Day and night, 'til darkness and light
I never worry when you're by my side

Oh, feelings change and seasons fade
But nothing will burn us out
Nothing can stop us now

Out of the embers
You and I are gonna light up the room
Out of the embers
There's a fire burning for you
I feel the heat here
There's still a chance for us
Down here in the ashes, yeah, there's something growing
Out of the embers
You and I are gonna light up the room

Light up the room
Light up the room

You and me forever, we're free
We're cool under pressure, and that's all we need
So take my hand, and forget the past
We're in this together, there's no looking back

Oh, feelings change and seasons fade
But nothing will burn us out
Nothing can stop us now

Out of the embers
You and I are gonna light up the room
Out of the embers
There's a fire burning for you
I feel the heat here
There's still a chance for us
Down here in the ashes, yeah, there's something growing
Out of the embers
You and I are gonna light up the room

Light up the room

Out of the embers
You and I are gonna light up the room
Out of the emberѕ
You and I are gonnа light up the room

Light up the room
Light up the room
