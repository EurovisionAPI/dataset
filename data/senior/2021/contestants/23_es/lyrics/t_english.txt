I'm going to stay

Stay tonight until the break of day
So that I feel your voice
Caressing me

Stay just for one more second
There's nothing to lose
While I draw a sea
Of memories in your skin

I made the sky come down to discover
What's hidden in your gaze
Just centimeters away from me

I'm going to stay and I promise
To love you more than yesterday
I'm going to kiss you very slowly
Like the first time

And I'll leave fears behind
With your soul between my fingers
Stay
Because I'm going to stay

I know there are many like me
With so much to offer
But I swear this love
Won't be defeated

And even though we made
A step back in our dance
Don't worry
I'll always dance with you

It doesn't matter if the world falls down today
Or whatever happens tomorrow
I'll stay by your side

I'm going to stay and I promise
To love you more than yesterday
I'm going to kiss you very slowly
Like the first time

And I'll leave fears behind
With your soul between my fingers
Stay
Because I'm going to stay

Let the floor quake by your side
May the Sun wane
May the sky fall
Just centimeters away both of us

And I'll leave fears behind
With your soul between my fingers
Stay
Because I'm going to ѕtаy
