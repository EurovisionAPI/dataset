Judy, my friend

Judy, my friend, you seem so thoughtful, why, Judy, my friend?
Judy, my friend, you are silent and sad, why, Judy, my friend?
Are you beginning to realize that you and I
May never be happy together, Judy, my friend?

Judy, my friend, you love things, house, TV and car
Your path is surrounded by luxury and gadgets, that's not my style
Our lifestyles are different, let me put it this way:
I can never be the man that you need, Judy, my friend

What am I like? Let me explain
I live for the moment, I'm just a dreamer
That's my philosophy
I want to feel: I'm free

Judy, my friend, your dream of money seems small and narrow
My dream is the dream of green meadows, the playful wind and a song

Maybe I'll change, then I'll get in touch
Then I'll introduce myself as your Mister Average

Judy, my friend, here we go our own ways, maybe we'll meet again
Then we'll see what life has done to us, Judy, my friend

What am I like? Let me explain
I live for the moment, I'm just a dreamer
That's my philosophy
I want to feel: I'm free

Judy, my friend, here we go our own ways, maybe we'll meet again
Then we'll see what life hаs done to uѕ, Judy, my friend
Judy, my friend, Judy, my friend
