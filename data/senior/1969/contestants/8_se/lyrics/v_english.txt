Dear Mr. Jones

Watching the kids on a Monday morning, Dad's at work on a play
Loads to be done, but he keeps on yawning, cursing the break of day
Ask the bankman for a loan, tell him all about your home
Get a friend for life just like your wife ought to be, dear Mr. Jones

Think that his neighbors can't survive, not without luxury
Can't afford kids, staying next on the list, first – get a new TV
Never hard to give a loan to a man with such a home
Get a friend for life just like your wife ought to be, dear Mr. Jones

Dear Mr. Jones went on a caper
Dreams seem to force him to work on a paper
So lots of things we couldn't see
He's being what he wants to be

Ever so lonely, all on his own, break for time for some tea
Postman knocks on the door of his soul, how many letters? – Three
Dear Mr. Jones, you're simply dear Mr. Jones
Humble, obedient servant, dear Mr. Jones, oh dear me

Watching the kids on his own in the world, mixing a laugh with a moan
It takes all sorts to make up the world, little sorts like dear Mr. Jones

Dear Mr. Jones went on a caper
Dreams seem to force him to work on a paper
So lots of things we couldn't see
He's being what he wants to be

Watching the kids on his own in the world, mixing a laugh with a moan
It takes all sorts to make up the world, little sorts like dear Mr. Jones
Dear Mr. Jones, deаr Mr. Joneѕ
