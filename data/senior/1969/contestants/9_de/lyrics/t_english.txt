Primaballerina

Primaballerina, Primaballerina
Little porcelain figurette, why are you alone?
Primaballerina, Primaballerina
You dance on your musical clock
And must always be lonely

Primaballerina, Primaballerina
Primaballerina, music is your world
Primaballerina, Primaballerina
Turn to the chimes
You only feel lucky when you dance

You look pretty in your white dress
You have to pirouette, but never in a pair
Tell me, does your heart cry
When the nightingale sings a song for her lover?

Lalala… lalalala lalala…
Tell me, does your heart cry
When the nightingale sings a song for her lover?

Primaballerina, Primaballerina
Little porcelain figurette, you have never laughed
Primaballerina, Primaballerina
Who cast a spell on you and brought you to fairytale land?

You look pretty in your white dress
You have to pirouette, but never in a pair
Tell me, don't you cry
When the moon lights up the lovers' smiles?

Lalala… lalalala lalala…
Tell me, don't you cry
When the moon lights up the lovers' smiles?

Primaballerina, Primaballerina
Everything beautiful in this world fades away eventually
Primaballerina, Primaballerina
Little porcelain figurette, you'll never understand that

Primaballerina, Primaballerina
Primaballerina, once your happiness will break in two
Primaballerina, Primaballerina
Primaballerina, and then the dаnce iѕ over
