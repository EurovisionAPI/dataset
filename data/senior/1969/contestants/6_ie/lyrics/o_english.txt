The Wages of Love

Look before you leap right into love, my friend
It cannot be bought so very cheap, my friend
Love that makes you laugh
Love that makes you cry
Before you really understand it
It can make you live, it can make you die

There will be bridges to be crossed
And there'll be teardrops to be lost
Or you will have to pay the cost
Just wait and see, oh yeah
There are many rainbows on the way
Days are maybe bright or maybe grey
So when you fall in love, you pay
The wages of love
The wages of love
The wages of love

Just take my advice, don't be a fool, my friend
When you fall in love, you go to school, my friend
Lessons must get learned
Fingers must get burned
Before you really understand it
Love is very nice if you pay the price

There will be bridges to be crossed
And there'll be teardrops to be lost
Or you will have to pay the cost
Just wait and see, oh yeah
There are many rainbows on the way (On the way)
Days are maybe bright or maybe grey (Maybe grey)
So when you fall in love, you pay
The wages of love
The wages of love
The wages of love

There will be bridges to be crossed (To be crossed)
And there'll be teardrops to be lost (To be lost)
Or you will have to pay the cost
Just wait and see
There are many rainbows on the way (On the way)
Days are maybe bright or maybe grey (Maybe grey)
So when you fall in love, you pay
The wages of love
The wages of love
The wаgeѕ of love
