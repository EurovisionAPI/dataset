Two big white tears

Our heart, you always said
Is not a room that you rent out
We left each other, the room is empty
The door will stay open

Two big white tears
Like two pearls from the sea
Is all for me that's left from you

No, you don't die because of love
Not to hear your voice
I'll hide my head under my pillow

Like a flash that opens the sky
I saw clearly in the middle of the dark
No, you don't die only because of love
Laughing, you said that to me

Two big white tears
Like two pearls from the sea
Is all for me that's left from you

Two big white tears
That won't make a noise
Because the last oneѕ are never heаvy, you know
