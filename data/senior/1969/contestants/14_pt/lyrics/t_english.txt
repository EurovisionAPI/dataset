Portuguese husking

Body of linen, lips of must
My lovely body, my burning fire
Corn threshing-floor, August moonlight
Who conceives a child, does it for pleasure

It's red maize, red coloured maize
Flesh wart, grain of love
Son of a king that, being old
Is born again when times are warm

My word spoken at the rising sun's light
My dawning madrigal
Love, love, love, love, love present
In every husked corncob

La la la…

My green pine root
My blue sky touching the ridge
Oh, my sorrow and my thirstiness
Oh, sea south of my homeland

It's blonde wheat, it's beyond Tejo
My country at this moment
The sun burns it, the wind kisses it
Crazy cereal field in motion

My word spoken at the rising sun's light
My dawning madrigal
Love, love, love, love, love present
In every husked corncob

La la la…

Almond eyes, obscure cistern
Where misfortune is its porch
Hidden moor, enchanted moor
Lost legend, found legend

Oh, my homeland, my adventure
Helpless nutshell
Oh, my homeland, my remoteness
By myself lost, by myѕelf found

La la lа…
