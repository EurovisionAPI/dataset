I live singing

(Pa para para papa…)
(Pa para para papa…)

How many nights I wandered
Through a thousand endless paths?
How many nights I kept silent
About what I wanted to say?
A deep hope
And a faraway echo was telling me about you

Today since you came back to my life
I now only sing for you

Since you arrived, I don't live crying
I live singing, I live dreaming
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side

Since you arrived, I don't live crying (hey)
I live singing (hey), I live dreaming (hey)
But I wonder how long I could keep
Your love deep inside of me

(Pa para para papa…)
(Pa para para papa…)

Since you arrived, I no longer live crying (hey)
I live singing (hey), I live dreaming (hey)
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling from being by your side

Since you arrived, I no longer live crying (hey)
I live singing (hey), I live dreaming (hey)
But I wonder how long I could keep
Your love deep inside of me

Since you arrived, I no longer live crying (hey)
I live singing (hey), I live dreaming (hey)
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling from being by your side
Because I'm trembling from being by your ѕide

(Pa para para papa…)
(Pa para para papа…)

(Hey, hey)
