Like in those times

Like in those times, in those times
In those times, everything's as well again
Like in those times, in those times
In those times, everything's well again

I feel again like in those times
Like there was no yesterday
I can come to see you like in those times
And I know, I won't ever go away

Your eyes shine, I see just that, nothing else
My heart repeats what
That bluethroat, nightingale warbles

Everything's again like once before
And I couldn't hope for anything else

Like in those times, in those times
In those times, everything's as well again
Like in those times, in those times
In those times, everything's well again

Everything's again like once before
And I couldn't hope for anything else

Like in those times, in those times
In those times, everything's as well again
Like in those times, in those times
In those times, everything'ѕ well agаin
