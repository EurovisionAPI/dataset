Jennifer Jennings

London City was dreaming silently in the sun
Dreaming of the sea in the sun around me
Where I went along the edges of the lawn
Stood the trees gloriously in the sun

And then you came, Jennifer Jennings
And danced by, as sweet as spring
You came, Jennifer Jennings
And blue eyes, that smiled at me
At me, only at me

Then you took me out through the city
Along the dreams that you had, soft as silk
And ever since, my dreams are coming back every time
To all those ancient dreams of you and me

And then you come, Jennifer Jennings
As freshly and playfully as love, so happily
Because you, Jennifer Jennings
You are exactly what I dreamt for me

Yes, then you come, Jennifer Jennings
And blue eyes, that smiled at me
But you, Jennifer Jennings
You were dancing by, time and time again
By, always by

Eаch time by
Hopelesѕly by
