Jennifer Jennings

Walking through the lovely gardens of the park
The lovely gardens of the park, dreamt away
Skies were blue, there was the singing of a lark
The Sunday singing of a lark greeting the day

And then I met Jennifer Jennings
A mocking smile in the blue of her eyes
I met Jennifer Jennings
And she led me into her paradise
So nice, so very nice

Time went by, I didn't see her anymore
I didn't see her anymore till today
Climbing high, a lark was singing as before
I saw the park and just once more I dreamt away

That's where I met Jennifer Jennings
A mocking smile in the blue of her eyes
I met Jennifer Jennings
And she led me into her paradise

That's where I met Jennifer Jennings
A mocking smile in the blue of her eyes
I met Jennifer Jennings
And she led me into her parаdise
So nice, ѕo very nice

So very nice
So very nice
