Mum, Mum

Mum, Mum, I had a marvelous dream
Mum, Mum, and I've grown up

I marched in step, helmet, rifle and backpack
In the light of a morning, the sun shone high
It followed me like a friend

Mum, Mum, I had a marvelous dream
Mum, Mum, we both left

On a great ship, all white, a flag floating high
And I was the commander, left for the islands of the wind
You were proud of me, Mum

Mum, Mum, I had a marvelous dream

But suddenly my childhood dream stops
And I see appearing the real adult life
I have time, I have time

Mum, Mum, I had a bad dream
Mum, Mum, I saw your white hair

I want to forget the soldier and the big ship
I want to stay near you and may God save you for a long time
You, the most beautiful of all mums

Mum, Mum, I still want to be а child
Hold me close to you, Mum
Hold me cloѕe to you, Mum
