Wow, wow, wow, how happy I'll be

Wow, wow, wow, how happy I'll be
When he no longer has someone on the side
Wow, wow, wow, then I'll have a party
And I will be the only guest

Wow, wow, wow, how happy I'll be
When I can set all the competition free
Wow, wow, wow, alone with you
Yes, that's top of the world for me

I've got the world's most handsome guy, that's for sure
But he has too much of an appetite for miniskirt-invites
He runs after Eva, Lise and Anne
Frolicking like a fish in the sea

But every time he sets sails
I dream with all my heart:

Wow, wow, wow, how happy I'll be
When he no longer has someone on the side
Wow, wow, wow, then I'll have a party
And I will be the only guest

Wow, wow, wow, how happy I'll be
When I can set all the competition free
Wow, wow, wow, alone with you
Yes, that'ѕ top of the world for me

Lalalala lalalala… lalala lalalala lalalala…
Lalalala lalalala… lalala lalala lalala…
Lalala lalala… lalala lalalalа…

Wow, wow, wow, wow
