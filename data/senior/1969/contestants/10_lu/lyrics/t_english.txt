Catherine

Catherine, Catherine, we were ten years old
Do you remember, Catherine? In the kindergarten
I gave you my bread and my chocolate
With my heart, Catherine, already in love

And when the night closed the garden again
Broke my childish heart to pieces
You left me alone with my sorrow
You dreamed about prince charming

If I laugh, Catherine, I had in my heart
Many laughs, Catherine, sad like my cries

Where are you and prince charming?
Have you found him at last?
Our hearts are always and our names are always there
Engraved on the garden tree

Catherine, Catherine, in the kindergarten
Catherine, Catherine, we were ten years old

Catherine, Catherine, I often dream
Before the others, Catherine, in the kindergarten
Catherine, Catherine, and in Ñ•pite of time
I waited for you, Catherine, like before, in the kindergarten
