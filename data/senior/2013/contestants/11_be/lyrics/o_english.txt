Love Kills

So the arrow shot right through her heart and rocked her to the core
And she fell so deep like she had never fell so deep before
But the pain was almost unbelievable
When the end was near, she felt the fear alive, alive, alive

Waiting for the bitter pill, give me something I can feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill, something I can truly feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love kills over and over again

'Cause he didn't fight for life when he was up against the wall
And he felt so scared for both of them, even though they had it all
There's a lesson that you always have to learn
Through the consequence of fire comes the burn

Waiting for the bitter pill, give me something I can feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill, something I can truly feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love kills over and over again

One last, one last, one last breath for life
Won't you give me, give me hope tonight?

I've been waiting for the bitter pill, give me something I can feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill, something I can truly feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love killѕ over and over agаin
