Waterfall

There's no me without you
Don't know what I would do
You're my heartbeat, I'm breathing because of you

There's no world without us
Dreams would turn into dust
You're the reason, the reason I make it through

Feels like I'm flying, like if I had wings
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams
Your love is pouring down on me
You're my waterfall

In a moment like this
I'm in a state of bliss
I'm swept away, I look into an open sky

Feels like I'm flying, like if I had wings
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams
Your love is pouring down on me
You're my waterfall

My heart is higher than the highest kite
I feel how all your love surrounds me
Standing in a waterfall

Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams
Your love is pouring down on me
You're my waterfall

Feels like I'm flying, like if I had wings
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams
Your love iѕ pouring down on me
You're my waterfаll
