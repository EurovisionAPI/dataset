The essential

Heroes claim that if the game gets tough, it's time to play
Then bless them who confuse insults with good acts
It also happens to us, making war and then aspiring peace
And in my silence, I annul your every single pain
And appreciate what I could not choose

As the world falls to pieces
I compose new spaces and desires
That also belong to you
Who will always be the essential to me

I won't accept another error of judgement
Love is able to hide behind kind words
Which I have spoken before
They were empty and stupid

As the world falls to pieces
I compose new spaces and desires
That also belong to you

As the world falls to pieces
I distance from excesses and from bad habits
I will go back to the origin
I go back to you, who are the essential to me

Love doesn't follow logic
It takes away your breath and thirst

As the world falls to pieces
I compose new spaces and desires
That also belong to you

As the world falls to pieces
I distance from excesses and from bad habits
I will go back to the origin
I go back to you, who are the esѕentiаl to me
