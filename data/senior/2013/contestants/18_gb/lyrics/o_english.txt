Believe In Me

You say you don't believe in signs from up above
And you laugh at the thought of putting your faith in stuff like love
You never see the rainbow, you just curse the rain, you say
You wanna believe but it's just not worth the pain today

But that's all fine if that's how you want it to be
But if you're feeling alone and afraid and you can't breathe

Believe in me, yeah
Believe in me, yeah

Believe in the way I look at you and stand beside you
The way I speak the truth, I'd never lie to you
If you just believe in the things that your eyes can see
Believe in me

You come and you go and there's never no compromise, that's why
The seconds and the minutes of the days of your life go crawling by
But that's all fine if that's how you want it to be
But if you're feeling alone and afraid and you can't breathe

Believe in me, yeah
Believe in the way I look at you and stand beside you
The way I speak the truth, I'd never lie to you
If you just believe in the things that your eyes can see
Believe in me

What ya gonna do when your ship is sinking?
And you're crying out for help and just the seagull's listening
In the dark of the night, in the middle of the fight
When you're reaching out for something and there's nothing

Believe in me, yeah
Believe in the way I look at you and stand beside you
The way I speak the truth, I'd never lie to you
If you just believe in the things that your eyes cаn ѕee
Believe in me
