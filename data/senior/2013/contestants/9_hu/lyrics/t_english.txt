Sweetheart

My sweetheart is a girl
Raised by wolves
She dances with a mirage
And quietly slips away
She's my sweetheart
She's my sweetheart

My sweetheart is a girl
Who embraces the seven continents
Splashes in beautiful seas and
Dances amongst the clouds above
My sweetheart
She's my sweetheart

Because to me
There is no one else, just my sweetheart, she's my sweetheart
Wherever she goes, it's fine by me, it's fine by me, because
She always finds me, my sweetheart, my sweetheart
I hum – it's so good for me, it's so good for me, this song

My sweetheart is a girl
Who is torn by whimsical dreams
Messy hair in the morning
Weaved by the wind
That makes my sweetheart different
She's my sweetheart

My sweetheart for infinity
Messes up and is never afraid
She makes a carriage of rosemary
Pulled by crickets, soothing me quietly
She's my sweetheart

Because to me
There is no one else, just my sweetheart, she's my sweetheart
Wherever she goes, it's fine by me, it's fine by me, because
She always finds me, my sweetheart, my sweetheart
I hum – it's so good for me, it's so good for me, this song

There is no one else, just my sweetheart, she's my sweetheart
Wherever she goes, it's fine by me, it's fine by me, because
She always finds me, my sweetheart, my sweetheаrt
I hum – it's so good for me, it's so good for me, this ѕong
