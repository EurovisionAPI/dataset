You And Me

When the times are getting rough, gold and silver turn to dust
People build their barricades out of jealousy and hate
But there's one thing they could never, never ever separate

Ah… let it hear from near and far
This is how it's meant to be, we're together, you and me
Ah… nothing can tear us apart
Sailing on a stormy sea, we're together, you and me

We build castles with our hands, on a solid ground they stand
They're our shelter from the storm, keep us safe and keep us warm
No, there's nothing that can hurt us, whatever there may come

Ah… let it hear from near and far
This is how it's meant to be, we're together, you and me
Ah… nothing can tear us apart
Sailing on a stormy sea, we're together, you and me

Time is flowing to the sea, but it's still you and me
Nothing's like it used to be, but we're here, you and me

Ah… let it hear from near and far
This is how it's meant to be, we're together, you and me
Ah… nothing can tear us apart
Sailing on a stormy sea, we're together, you and me

Ah, nothing can tear us apart
Sailing on a stormy ѕea, we're together, you аnd me
