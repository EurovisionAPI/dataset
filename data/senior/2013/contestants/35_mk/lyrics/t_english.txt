Before the dawn

It's not like before
the good times are gone
In the Good or in the Bad
we were living

Before the dawn
be next to me
In the new day
me and you to be together

Before the dawn
stay next to me
Now it's the time for beautiful days
Stay next to me

Me, Esma, singing to you
will warm your hearts
Me, Esma, singing to you
will warm your hearts

So, shake your hips
come on now, get up all gypsies
Eh… oh…

If you come back
the good times will come back too
Either joy or sorrow
we will share together

Before the dawn
be next to me
In the new day
me and you to be together
Stay next to me

Me, Esma, singing to you
will warm your hearts
Me, Esma, singing to you
will warm your hearts

So, shake your hips
come on now, get up all gypsieѕ
Eh… oh…

Before the dawn
be next to me
In the new day
me and you to be together
Stаy next to me
