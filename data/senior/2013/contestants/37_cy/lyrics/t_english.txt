If you remember me

For everything I lived, I never regret
For everything I loved, I don't feel sorry
For everything I want, I take my soul high
And for everything you gave me, I thank you

If you remember me
Tell me if I'm gonna see you again
I'm waiting for you
I'll always be here for you

For everything that joined our hearts in one
For everything we felt together, I miss you
And I will always be here for your hardest goodbye
For the sweetest "I love you" you ever said

If you remember me
Tell me if I'm gonna see you again

If you remember me
Tell me if I'm gonna,if I'm gonna see you again
I'm waiting for you
I'll always be here for you

If you remember me
Become a bright star
When the night falls
As I look into the sky

If you remember me
Become a stаr
As I look into the ѕky
