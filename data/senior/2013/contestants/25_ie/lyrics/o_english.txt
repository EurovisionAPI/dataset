Only Love Survives

All our lives we've been afraid
Watching the world decline till nothing remains
But in our darkest hour, right before the dawn
The old world dies, the new day is born

We're gonna live like it's our last night alive
And we're dancing till the morning light
And even if the sun don't rise
In the end, only love survives

So be love, be love
Just be love (just be love), only love (only love)
We are love (we are love), only love (only love)
And when the stars are aligned, you got to make love a state of mind
'Cause in the end only love survives

So let the world collide, don't be afraid
If it's the end of time, love will remain

To live like it's the last night alive
And we're dancing till the morning light
And even if the sun don't rise
In the end, only love survives

So be love, be love
Just be love (just be love), only love (only love)
We are love (we are love), only love (only love)
And when the stars are aligned you got to make love a state of mind
'Cause in the end, only love survives

So be love (be love), only love, love, love
(Be love, only love) Only love, love, love
('Cаuse in the end) Only love surviveѕ
