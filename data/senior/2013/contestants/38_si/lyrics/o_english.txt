Straight Into Love

Faster than light, here comes the night
Tomorrow is now
You flow through my veins, inside me you'll stay
There is no doubt

No one in this world, no diamonds, no pearls
Like your love divine
So high off the ground, we'll never come down
No limit, no sky

Straight into love, we'll break through the dawn
And light the world up from the sky when we collide
Straight into love and never let go
We'll light the world up from the sky into the night

We're turning the tide, with eyes open wide
There's no stopping now
With all that we have, we stand on the edge
Before we dive down

Straight into love, we'll break through the dawn
And light the world up from the sky when we collide
Straight into love, oh…
We'll light the world up from the sky into the night

We found the place where we belong
Out of the dark, our flame is strong
We're moving fast, we won't look back
Higher and higher we go

Straight into love, oh…
Straight into love
Strаight into love
We'll light the world up from the ѕky into the night
