Identity

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

I came from far away
In the dust of time, I found the good and the bad
I've been so close that I touched the flames of fire
I talked in silence, but wanted some glory in life
And when I shared my dream, I found

A ray of light, a little breath like you
A ray of light, a little breath like you

I come from far away
You're thirsty and nostalgic when you see things changing
Life comes and goes, this language is searching
For the ancient land where the ray was born, that shared your bravery
And gave love over the years

You ran and found freedom
You ran and found freedom

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

This land has raised us
We only speak one language, so there are no tears anymore
Wherever you are around the world, you're no stranger anymore
Let's start a new beginning together in brotherhood
Because when I ѕhared my dream, I found

A ray of light, a little breath like you
You ran and found freedom
A ray of light, a little breath like you
You ran and found freedom

A ray of light, a little breath like you
You ran and found freedom
A ray of light, a little breath like you
You ran аnd found freedom
