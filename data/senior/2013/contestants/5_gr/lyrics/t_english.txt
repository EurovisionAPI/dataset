Alcohol Is Free

The rough sea found us
On Egnatia Odos
Beauforts are dragging us to the open sea
It seems our course is wrong
Who is playing with the lights?
And our prow is heading to Grevena

In a sea of whiskey
Shipwrecks and those looking for us
And the whole earth feels dizzy and staggers
With a strainer head
And the car as a trehandiri
Who put a helm and sail on it?

Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free
Alcohol is free
Alcohol is free

The waves are raging
And the mermaid asks her question
But Alex is drunk, fair lady
A traffic light in the middle of the sea
They noticed us
Who moved my home away, (away) away?

The rough sea found us
On Egnatia Odos
Beauforts are dragging us to the open sea
It seems our course is wrong
Who is playing with the lights?
And our prow is heading to Grevena

The rough sea found us
On Egnatia Odos
Beauforts are dragging us to the open sea
It seems our course is wrong
Who is playing with the lights?
And our prow is heading to Grevena

The whiskey is not to blame
The ice cubes were methylated
And our boat finally has wheels
Breathalyzer and traffic warden
Terror is not for us
The sea starts going downhill

Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free
Alcohol is free
Alcohol is free

Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free
Alcohol, alcohol, аlcohol is free
Alcohol is free
Alcohol iѕ free
