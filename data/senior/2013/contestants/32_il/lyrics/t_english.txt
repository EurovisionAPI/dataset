Only for him

Once again at nighttime, the rain stops falling
Still trying to steal a smile from his lips
Silences say so much and hide so much
So much truth is left from all the wondering

Only for him I could forget the cold
And thanks to him I'll find the light in the darkness
Only for him I'll walk, I'll cross the frontiers
Only with him I'll know answers to the questions

Only for him I could forget the cold
And thanks to him I'll find the light in the darkness
Only for him I'll walk, I'll cross the frontiers
Only with him I'll know answers to the questions

Once again at daytime, I'll save a warm and enveloping gaze
Still trying to caress his face quietly
So many tears have gone and so many have remained
So many hopes were built and so many were broken

Only for him I could forget the cold
And thanks to him I'll find the light in the darkness
Only for him I'll walk, I'll cross the frontiers
Only with him I'll know answers to the questions

Only for him I could forget the cold
And thanks to him I'll find the light in the darkness
Only for him I'll walk, I'll cross the frontiers
Only with him I'll know answers to the questions

(Once again at daytime, I'll save a warm and enveloping gaze)
Still trying to caress his face quietly

Only for him I could forget the cold
And thanks to him I'll find the light in the darkness
Only for him I'll walk, I'll cross the frontiers
Only with him I'll know answers to the questions

Only for him I could forget the cold
And thanks to him I'll find the light in the darkness
Only for him I'll walk, I'll cross the frontiers
Only with him I'll know аnswers to the questionѕ
