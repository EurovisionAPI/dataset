Shine

When hurt is all you're feeling, your heart is slowly bleeding
They're only memories to hold on to
When you almost stop believing, cold, alone and freezing
You think you're lost and don't know where to go
Look up to the starlit sky, reignite the fire

You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky
You will shine, I see the light in your eyes
You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky
Oh, you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes
Trust me, you will shine

Time is always healing and answers are revealing
Sometimes they're simply right before your eyes
But when you're down here kneeling, there is no chance to see it
You can when all these dark clouds disappear
Look up to the starlit sky, reignite the fire

You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky (Shine)
You will shine, I see the light in your eyes (Shine)
You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky (Shine)
Oh, you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes
Trust me, you will shine

(Still alive and breathing) Hey…
(Still alive and breathing) Hoh…
(Still alive and breathing) Hey.
(Still alive and breathing)
Still alive and breathing, hoh…

You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky (Shine)
You will shine, I see the light in your eyes (Shine)
You will shine, shine and fight the shаdows in the sky (Shine)
Oh, you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes

Oh, you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes
Trust me, you will ѕhine
