Misery

I don't have gold to adorn you with
Only these two arms to embrace your soul

Oh misery, you're as hard as rock
Oh misery, you're like two drops of wine
I have nothing, only faith
And a little bit of pure love

Oh misery, you're as hard as rock
Oh misery, you're like two drops of wine
I have nothing, only faith
And a little bit of pure love

Oh beautiful rose of mine, for you I will live
And the last piece of dried old bread I'll share with you

Oh misery, you're as hard as rock
Oh misery, you're like two drops of wine
I have nothing, only faith
And a little bit of pure love

Oh misery, you're as hard as rock
Oh misery, misery, misery

Oh misery, you're as hard as rock
Oh misery, you're like two drops of wine
I have nothing, only faith
And a little bit of pure love

I have nothing, only faith
And а little bit of pure love
