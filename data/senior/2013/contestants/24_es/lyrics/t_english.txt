With you until the end

Ah…

A blue sky overtakes the storm
Which threatened my heart
And you arrive with everything you signify
Discovering myself who I am

You are that light that crosses the universe
You invite me to fly with you until the end

The illusion of a lifetime ahead of us
Which starts right now
Let's go without fear, shout that in the end love conquered all
That now, it's you and I

You are that light that crosses the universe
You invite me to fly, oh
You are that light that crosses the universe
You invite me to fly with you until the end, oh yeah
With you until the end

You are that light that crosses the universe
You invite me to fly, oh
You are that light that crosses the univerѕe
You invite me to fly with you until the end, oh yeah
With you until the end, oh yeаh

With you until the end
