Love is everywhere

Love, love doesn't exist, they say
They lie, don't be afraid when he's here
Love for your entire life and beyond
That's what it's going to be with him

I'll ask you in a year
When he cheats on you from all sides
Your heart is fish food
You should know that

I, like I'm crazy
I want to, then I don't want to believe
Because I don't know if I may

Yes, love is everywhere
I love, then I don't love
I would try everything with him

You're dreaming, you're dreaming of a world in colour, in blue
You're dreaming, because he's yours
Don't listen to his lies anymore
When he kisses you, tell him ok, you

I, like I'm crazy
I want to, then I don't want to believe
Because I don't know if I may

Yes, love is everywhere
I love, then I don't love
I would try everything with him

You would wait for him every night until dawn
He will make you coffee while you're still in bed
Trust me, trust me, sister, I'm doing you a favour
Lalala lalala lalala…

I, like I'm crazy
Love is everywhere

Yes, love is everywhere
I love, then I don't love
I would try everything with him
And mаybe something more ѕkillful
