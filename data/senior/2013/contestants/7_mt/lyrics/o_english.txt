Tomorrow

Whoah… oh…
Whoah… oh…

His name is Jeremy, working in IT
Never questions why he has always been
An extra careful guy, sensitive and shy
Risk assessment is his investment in a life of no surprise
Till she walked into his life

She, spontaneous indeed, uncertainty's her creed
She has always been neither black or white
Just a curious delight
She threw affection in his direction, a collection of her smiles
And to his surprise, whoah…

She's like tomorrow, oh so distant
She just wants to play
Like tomorrow, she is always one day away
All the time she slips away, it's close but yet so far
It's time to follow her tomorrow, whoah… oh…
Time to follow her tomorrow, whoah… oh…

He fell for her too fast, we all thought it wouldn't last
'Cause good ol' Jeremy likes his rigorous routine
'Cause he only thinks today but tomorrow is her way
So find a new direction and you will be okay

She's like tomorrow, so distant, she just wants to play
Like tomorrow, she is always one day away
All the time she slips away, it's close but yet so far
It's time to follow her tomorrow, oh… oh…

Time to follow her tomorrow, oh… oh…
Time to follow her tomorrow, oh… oh…
Time to follow her tomorrow, oh… oh…

She's like tomorrow, oh so distant, she just wants to play
Like tomorrow, she is always one day away
One day away (One day away)
One day away (One day away)

And all the time she slips away, it's close but yet so fаr
It's time to follow her tomorrow (Oh… oh…)
It's time to follow her tomorrow (Oh… oh…)
It'ѕ time to follow her tomorrow
