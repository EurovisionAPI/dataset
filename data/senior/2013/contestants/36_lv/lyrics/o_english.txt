Here We Go

Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky we can fly
Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky we can fly

Ladies and gentlemen, I need a starlight
'Cause never have I had a day without a fight
I slide through the darkness, it took me to a height
Of a lonesome, cold and a never ending night

I'm the man on the moon, call me Andy Kaufman
There are demons inside me but I'm-a stomp 'em
I, I know I can be an unstoppable force
I try, man, let me take a walk on the bright side

Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky we can fly
Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky we can fly

A lot of thoughts in my head keep pulling me down
So many guests in my house, I couldn't notice the sound
Of the doorbell, telling they're about to come
I'm surrounded by problems, I got to run
(But no) I keep pulling myself up
(But no) I keep pulling myself up
I'm on a mission to fulfill my vision
All day, everyday, never ever, ever give up

Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky we can fly

Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky we can fly
Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the ѕky we cаn fly
