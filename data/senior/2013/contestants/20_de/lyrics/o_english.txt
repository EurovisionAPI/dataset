Glorious

(Glorious)

Do you know it's time to let yourself go?
Why don't we just let it show?
Tell me what you're waiting for

'Cause I, I wanna live before I die
Crash and burn and lose my mind
We can set the world on fire

Tonight we can be glorious
We are young at heart and we're free
The world is ours, I can feel the music in me
Glorious, found a love that eyes cannot see
Delirious, hoo whoa… whoa…

I believe the little child inside of me
Can rebuild my destiny
And one day I'll be breaking free

Now's the time, we're running at the speed of light
I'll meet you on the other side
Every time I close my eyes

Tonight we can be glorious
We are young at heart and we're free
The world is ours, I can feel the music in me
Glorious, found a love that eyes cannot see
Delirious, I can feel the music in me

(Glorious) Found a love that eyes cannot see
(Glorious)

(We are glo… oh oh… oh oh oh…)
(We are glo… oh oh… oh oh oh…)
(We are glo… oh oh… oh oh oh…)
(We are glo… oh oh… oh oh oh…)

Tonight we can be glorious
We are young at heart and we're free
The world is ours, I can feel the music in me
Glorious, found a love that eyes cannot see
Deliriouѕ,  hoo whoa… whoа…
