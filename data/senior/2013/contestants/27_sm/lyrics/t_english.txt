Chrysalis

Hoo… mmh…

Sometimes inside of me
I've felt an emptiness that
Called me from within
Come now to see the truth
There's a bridge over the immensity

What am I, deep inside of me?
God's fragile dream
With a body made like this
Big eyes, colours, die living
Renewed for eternity

Fly, fly, may the strength come
Always alone towards another freedom
The new butterfly always leaves behind
The chrysalis you once were
Empty without me

You know that from the clouds
The rain will soon fall down
It happens suddenly
Wings drowned in tears that don't dry
The wind will come soon

And you fly, fly, fly away from yourself
Always alone until a reflection appears
In the mirror that steals the image
In thousand pieces of vertigo
And light will shine

How much life is there?
I've never noticed it
And if you still don't know it
The universe, it's us

Fly, may the strength come
Never alone again, towards another freedom
The new butterfly leaves behind
The chrysalis and even more
Empty without me

Fly, you'll be in joy
Never alone again in our immensity
Sudden love, like a new ѕun
Everything will chаnge

Fly, fly, fly together with me
