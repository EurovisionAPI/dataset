Solayoh

Friday night was going nowhere
Sitting in a small cafe
Feeling lonely, a little tired
I'd been working hard all day

Then a noise caught my attention
And I heard a wonderful sound
Coming at me like a tsunami
Nearly took my feet off the ground

A rush of excitement brought you to my ears
All beautiful people aha-ia ia-ia-ia…

Solayoh, Solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya
We play-oh, we play-oh to the rhythm of a cha-cha
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna getcha
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night (Yeah)

Situation started improving
Maybe this was kismet now
And my body just started moving
I was really shaking down

Something happened when I was dancing
I could feel that powerful beat
Taking me to new dimensions
Waking up the devil in me

A heavenly chorus and love all around
All beautiful people aha-ia ia-ia-ia…

Solayoh, Solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya
We play-oh, we play-oh to the rhythm of a cha-cha
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna getcha
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night (Yeah)

Chacha, hey
Hey, hey…

It feels like I'm dreaming
This word makes no sense
Let's sing it again now, ahey…
Solay…

Solayoh, Solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya
We play-oh, we play-oh to the rhythm of a cha-cha
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna getcha
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night

Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it'ѕ gonna getcha
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night
We can make it into a cha-chа
