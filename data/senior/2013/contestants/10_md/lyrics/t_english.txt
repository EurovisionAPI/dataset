A Thousand

A thousand sunsets lost in the sea, lost within us
A thousand sun rays used to bring morning light on our eyelashes
A thousand shooting stars captured our gaze
A thousand secular nights vanished away in the skies, but we stood by

Between sun and rain, thousands of colours are born, but we only see clouds
We built up memories for ourselves, which we then destroyed
Between sun and rain, thousands of colours are born, but we only see clouds
We built up memories for ourselves, which we then destroyed

A thousand tears can't wash away the pain of losing you
For a thousand nights, the silence swallows me, it wants me to forget you
It's asking too much

I can't believe that the feeling we had is in the past
I want a new beginning

Between sun and rain, thousands of colours are born, but we only see clouds
We built up memories for ourselves, which we then destroyed
Between sun and rain, thousands of colours are born, but we only see clouds
We built up memories for ourselves, which we then destroyed

I believed in your love, I hoped it wouldn't dry up
I believed in big dreams, but you chose to vanish
I couldn't believe that the feeling we had was in the past
I want a new beginning

Between sun and rain, thousands of colours are born, but we only see clouds
We built up memories for ourselves, which we then destroyed
Between sun and rain, thousands of colours аre born, but we only see clouds
We built up memories for ourselves, which we then deѕtroyed
