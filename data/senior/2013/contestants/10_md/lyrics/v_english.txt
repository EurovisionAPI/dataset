A Million

A million sunsets are lost in the ocean
Lost in our minds
Your beautiful smile woke me up in the mornings
A million times
A million hopes were revealed in discretion
At shooting stars
And we didn't care that I was from Venus
And you were from Mars

I would give you my love, but it wasn't enough for us
To make it last
The Maya were not so wrong, it's the end of the world
It's done
Cause you are gone
I would give you my love, but it wasn't enough for us
To make it last
The Maya were not so wrong, it's the end of the world
It's done
Cause you are gone

A million tears cannot wash up the sorrow
That you made me feel
A million of memories I try not to follow
But I cannot heal
My heart is too ill
I thought that we can go on
But you chose to go alone
Go away! Now I'm done

I would give you my love, but it wasn't enough for us
To make it last
The Maya were not so wrong, it's the end of the world
It's done
Cause you are done
I would give you my love, but it wasn't enough for us
To make it last
The Maya were not so wrong, it's the end of the world
It's done
Cause you are gone

I gave you all that I had
But you broke my heart instead
I built a future for us
But you betrayed all my trust
I thought that we can go on
But you chose to go alone
Go away! Now I'm done

I would give you my
Love, but it wasn't enough for us to make it last
The Maya were not so wrong, it's the end of the world
It's done
Cause you are done
I would give you my love, but it wasn't enough for us
To make it last
The Maya were not so wrong, it's the end of the world
It's done
Cauѕe you аre done
