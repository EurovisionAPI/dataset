Party

I'm taking you to a party, to to-to-to a party ty ty-ty-ty
To a party, I'm taking you to a party
I'm taking you to a party, to to-to-to a party ty ty-ty-ty
To a party, I'm taking you to a party

It's a party, it doesn't stop, beat after beat, verse after verse
The whole world is moving along, and the universe in one go
Come on, take me, set me free from all the awful stress during the year
I can't be paranoid anymore, it seems to be a good party
It's a non-stop party, outside, on the dance floor or at the bar
We're still there when the sun comes up, it's never a waste
Nothing's impossible, you just have to get in with the rhythm
The beat and the bass are so catchy, no one will leave with money in their pockets
We'll do it again tomorrow, hanging out with my buddies, not thinking about money

May it last all night and day
And there will be even more, it will be even better, trust me
'Cause we're made for it
I'm taking you, I'm taking you, come with me
Come with me now
This is the night, it will never end
I'm taking you to a party

I need a party that won't stop until a girl is showing a piece of flesh
It's hot like an oven at 200 degrees, we're losing our mind, the strobe is flashing
The beat is crazy, it hits our head, my bag is burning, pour me a drink
Grill, garlic, parsley and fish, to make it through the day
Take me somewhere to cool my mind, somewhere where the music rocks
And doesn't stop, but just keeps pumping all night long, while everyone is there
My pressure's high, I hold on the pain, take me somewhere so I don't explode
Opening a can, the wonder of life, let's go to a party, where else should we go?

May it last all night and day
And there will be even more, it will be even better, trust me
'Cause we're made for it
I'm taking you, I'm taking you, come with me
Come with me now
This is the night, it will never end
I'm taking you to a party

Just let the beat kick, we're all buddies here
And the fact that our wallets are slim doesn't matter
Just let the beat kick, we're all buddies here
The drill will alwayѕ roll, but money won't

I'm taking you to a party, to to-to-to a party ty ty-ty-ty
To a party, I'm taking you to a party
I'm taking you to a party, to to-to-to a party ty ty-ty-ty
To a party, I'm taking you to a pаrty
