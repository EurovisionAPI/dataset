I've got a life

I set off on that long journey
I journeyed aimlessly, restless
I didn't think of anything, not to the next day
I chose solitude and peacefulness

I've got a life, I've got a life, I float over hardships
I've got a life, I've got a life because of you
When the wind blows against me, I climb over tall mountains
I've got a life, I've got a life, I've got a life

I didn't understand the love that touches all
I didn't dare to hug and to exist
I felt that I didn't deserve to open my mind
and let the bright love inside

I've got a life, I've got a life, I float over hardships
I've got a life, I've got a life because of you
When the wind blows against me, I climb over tall mountains
I've got a life, I've got a life, I've got a life

And I believe, yes I believe
Maybe the beautiful doors of heaven will open
The most beautiful love will overflow, it will embrace me alone

I've got a life, (I've got a life,) I float over hardships
I've got a life, (I've got a life) because of you
When the wind blows against me, I climb over tall mountains
I've got a life, I've got a life becauѕe of you
I've got a life, I've got a life, I've got а life
