Marry Me

Spying on you undercover, drinking coffee with your mother
Am I getting closer?
Baby, I feel like a sinner, skipping dinner to get thinner
Where is my proposal?

I'm your slave and you're my master
Oh baby, come on, take a shot

So marry me, I'll be your queen bee
I'll love you endlessly
I'll do it for you, for you, for you
Yeah, I'll do it for you, marry me, baby

I'll play your game, I'll change my last name
I'll walk the walk of shame
I'll do it for you, for you, for you
Yeah, I'll do it for you, marry me, baby

Oh oh, oh oh oh, ding dong
Oh oh, oh oh oh, ding dong

I know where the future's heading, I can see my perfect wedding
Isn't that just bracing?
I don't think that I know ladies who will give you cuter babies
Isn't that amazing?

I'm your slave and you're my master
Oh baby, come on, take a shot

So marry me, I'll be your queen bee
I love you endlessly
I'll do it for you, for you, for you
Yeah, I'll do it for you, marry me, baby

I'll play your game, I'll change my last name

I'll do it for you, for you, for you
Yeah, I'll do it for you, marry me, baby

This is the day, I don't wanna wait much longer now
If you run away, I'm gonna find you anyhow
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
What ya waiting, what ya waiting
What ya waiting for?
