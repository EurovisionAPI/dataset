Hell and me

You knocked me out from the start
I might even believe I kind of liked it
Leather ties and silk hands

Who do you hurt and in which pose
Until the dawn turns red?
You cast me off like a spell

I'm gonna give you hell
From where you lose yourself
Look well behind you
And it will be me

You made me cry fiercely
My neck still shows your tag
I liked exchanging skin

No limits,  it's a classic
I liked our toxic love
The kind that makes everything beautiful

I'm gonna give you hell
From where you lose yourself
Look well behind you

I'm gonna give you hell
From where you lose yourself
Look well behind you
And it will be me

I'm gonna give you hell
You're gonna lack air
A close call, unless
We end up together
Unless we have to
Renounce our battles

(I'm gonna give you hell) I'm gonna give you hell
You're gonna lack air (From where you lose yourself)
A close call, unless
We end up together (Look well behind you)
Unless we have to
Renounce our battles

(I'm gonna give you hell) I'm gonna give you hell
You're gonna lack air (From where you lose yourself)
A close call, unless
We end up together (Look well behind you)
Unlesѕ we have to
Renounce

(I'm gonnа give you hell)
