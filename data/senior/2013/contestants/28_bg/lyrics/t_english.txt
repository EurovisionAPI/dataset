Only Champions

Only Champions, Only Champions

Flying far and high
Jumping, laughing, crying
The youngest, the best and the bravest
All strong at heart

Only wild ones, only champions
Golden boys and girls for millions
Give us the young ones, give us the happy ones
And the whole village comes
Sing, don't be afraid

Only Champions, Only Champions

Give us young ones, give us happy ones
And the whole village comes

E… а… а… а…

Only wild ones, only champions
Golden boys and girls for millions
Only wild ones, only champions
Golden boys and girls for millions

Only wild ones, only champions
Golden boys аnd girls for millionѕ
