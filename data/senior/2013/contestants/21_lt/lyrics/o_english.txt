Something

I have to tell you something, it's been on my mind so long
I've got to tell you this, it's been on my mind way too long
I promised myself to tell
Instead I'm falling apart to see you here

If you don't know, I'm in love with you
When summertime falls, it becomes untrue
Because of my shoes I'm wearing today
One is called Love, the other is Pain, yeah…

So tell me now (So tell me now)
I'm in your head (I'm in your head)
I'm in your heart (I'm in your heart)
Tell me now (Tell me now)

Tell me now
Because I'm falling apart to see you here

If you don't know, I'm in love with you
When summertime falls, it becomes untrue
Because of my shoes I'm wearing today
One is called Love, the other is Pain

But still you don't know, I'm in love with you
When summertime falls, it becomes untrue
Because of my shoes I'm wearing today
One is called Love, the other is Pain
One is called Love, the other iѕ Pаin
