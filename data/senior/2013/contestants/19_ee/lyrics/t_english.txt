So there can be a new beginning

I still remember
When that great feeling came to stay within my soul
Now, I'm standing on the road
Looking into my heart, where the wind is whistling
But I know, I know
Everything may change for the better
Every door that closes, will once open again

The ice will melt again and the leafless tree will blossom
Every end is just a new beginning
We need the night, so the day can bring light
So there can be a new beginning
Let the past be past
So there can be a new beginning again

The curtain opens again
The next act is about to begin, where I get up
The same  soul, but with a new game ahead
My destiny can be changed, my path renewed
And I know, I know
Everything may change for the better
Every door that closes, will once open again

The ice will melt again and the leafless tree will blossom
Every end is just a new beginning
We need the night, so the day can bring light
So there can be a new beginning
Let the past be past

The ice will melt again and the leafless tree will blossom
Every end is just a new beginning
We need the night, so the day can bring light
So there can be a new beginning
Let the past be paѕt
So there can be a new beginning agаin
