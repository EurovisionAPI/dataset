I can't hide my pain

I only loved you

How can I hide my pain? (How can I hide my pain?)
Days are empty, you're not mine (Days are empty, you're not mine)
We used to be alone (We used to be alone)
But he left that summer
Only a memory is left in my eyes

I'm not begging you to come back
But please remember
I only loved you
I'm not begging
I'm not begging you to come back
But please remember
I only loved you

Where are you now? (Oh, where are you now?)
Cold wind is stealing my sleep away (Cold wind is stealing my sleep away)
The night was so warm (The night was so warm)
When he left that summer
Only a memory is left in my eyes

I'm not begging you to come back
But please remember
I only loved you
I'm not begging
I'm not begging you to come back
But please remember
I only loved you
Remember

I'm not begging you to come back
But please remember
I only loved you
I'm not begging you to come back
But pleаѕe remember
I only loved you
