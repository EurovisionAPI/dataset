Judy and Co

Judy, Judy isn't beautiful
Judy, Judy, the one who is forgotten
(She is forgotten)
From the moment the evening ends

Judy, Judy, you are needled
Judy, Judy, you are married
(You are married)
But always with a dream

Underneath your mascara and jewels
You pray to Saint Marylin Monroe
To be a doll, a darling toy
Burning with enthusiasm
Finally the woman

Judy, Judy escapes
Judy, Judy, in magic
(In magic)
Bottles that are so soft to believe

Judy, life is a ridiculous dream
A day, an evening changing of skin
With the girls on photo
To have a body, thin as reed
And eyes totally empty
But no wrinkles

Judy, Judy and company
Judy, Judy, she is sacrificed
(She is sacrificed)
Against a hаndful of ѕnow
Poor Judy
