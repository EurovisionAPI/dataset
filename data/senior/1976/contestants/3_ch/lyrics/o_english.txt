Djambo, Djambo

The birds have known the old man for many years
His eyes have seen so much and look so mild
He's up at four and early every morning
He feeds them and feels happy like a child

Once he was a clown in the arena
People said the best that ever was
Now they call him good old Djambo Djambo
But in his dreams, he still hears the applause

Hey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo
Don't be sad, for you know that the show must go on
Hey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo
It was you who had us laughing, you're the one

And sometimes you can see him on the sidewalk
With little boys and girls around his feets
When Djambo Djambo plays his barrel organ
Children call it circus in the streets

Suddenly his eyes reflect emotion
In Djambo's mind, the limelight shines again
He's back on stage and all the kids are laughing
Just as if the show would never end

Hey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo
Don't be sad, for you know that the show must go on
Hey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo
It was you who had us laughing, you're the one

Hey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo
Don't be sad, for you know that the show must go on
Hey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo
It was you who had us laughing, you're the one

It was you who had uѕ lаughing, you're the one
