A green-pine flower

I could call you my homeland
Give you the most beautiful pretty Portuguese name
I could give you the name of a queen
Because this love is like that of Pedro and Inês

But there is no form, there is no verse
There is no bed for this fire, my love, for this river
How can I say my heart jumped out of my chest?
My love overflowed and I'm without ship

Loving you is like a poem that I don't dare to say
There is no cup, my love, for this wine
There is no guitar or love song
There is no flower, there is no green-pine flower

There is no boat or wheat, there is no clover
No words to write this song
Loving you is a poem that I don't dare to write
There is a river without a riverbed and I'm without heart

There is no form, there is no verse
There is no bed for this fire, my love, for this river
How can I say my heart jumped out of my chest?
My love overflowed and I'm without ship

Loving you is like a poem that I don't dare to say
There is no cup, my love, for this wine
There is no guitаr or love song
There is no flower, there iѕ no green-pine flower
