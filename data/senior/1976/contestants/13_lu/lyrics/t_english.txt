Songs for those who love each other

So many melodies mark our life
And without them, the world would be poorer today

Presents or pasts, they make us dream
And everyone among us will keep hidden in their heart

Songs for those who love each other
Old songs with eternal words
Songs that are remembered and come back after love

Songs for those who love each other
New songs with words of lovers
Always loyal songs that recall us the happy days

We can redo everything, change the world
To live without frontiers, we'll sing
To forget history, to believe, not to believe anymore
In our memories, it will stay

Songs for those who love each other
That are remembered and that people were waiting for
One day, sing the ѕame and may it become
The hymn of peаce from now on, from now on
