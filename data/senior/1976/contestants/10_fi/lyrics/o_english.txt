Pump-Pump

I used to love watching beautiful girls go by in my time
You have done like the boys do, but now finally you are mine
Let bygones be bygones, now I love you
You gave me more than a man can ever dream, know what I mean?

Let your hip go hippety pump pump
That's the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay…
Let your hip go hippety pump pump
Give me shivers all down my spine… ay ay ay…
You are not a moment's playmate
You are the man of my life
Let your hip go hippety pump pump
That's the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay…

I used to worry so much about all kinds of little things
Now it is easy to laugh and to dance when it really swings
Now we're together forever, I know
Playing the games that two people only play when they're in love

Let your hip go hippety pump pump
That's the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay…
Let your hip go hippety pump pump
Give me shivers all down my spine… ay ay ay…
You are not a moment's playmate
You are the man of my life
Let your hip go hippety pump pump
That's the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay…

Let your hip go hippety pump pump
That's the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay…
Let your hip go hippety pump pump
Give me shivers all down my spine… ay ay ay…
Let your hip go hippety pump pump
That'ѕ the way we dаnce till we die
