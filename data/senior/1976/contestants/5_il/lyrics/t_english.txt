Say hello

Come, come, come today
I'm still here so come say hello
Say hello

Come, come, come today
I'm still here so come say hello
Say hello

Come right now, give me your hand
Give me your hand, I can already see the horizon
Come right now, give me your hand
I've been alone for almost thirty years

Come, come, come today
I'm still here so come say hello
Say hello

Come, come, come today
I'm still here so come say hello
Say hello

If we'd go towards each other
We'll meet one another today by the roadside
Then we'll walk hand in hand
And fill every lost moment

Come, come, come today
I'm still here so come say hello
Say hello

Come, come, come today
I'm still here so come say hello
Say hello

Give me a la, give me a re, give me a mi
I want to sing a duet
Give me a fa, give me a sol
Then everyone will sing in a great voice

Come, come, come today
I'm still here so come say hello
Say hello

Come, come, come today
I'm still here so come say hello
Say hello

Come right now, give me your hand
Give me your hand, I can already ѕee the horizon
Come right now, give me your hand
Come right now and give me your hаnd
