You, the music and I

And Paris looks sad under the rain
And Paris looks sad in your eyes
In your room up there, you are bored
You fall asleep like an unhappy clown

Let go of these wet streets
And of these people who are always hasty
Let go of your despair and follow me

If you want, we'll live - you, the music and I
Yes, simply you, the music and I
In another universe above the clouds
If you want, we'll live - you, the music and I
Yes, simply you, the music and I
In a new world, almost unreal

Imagine a town in the sun
Imagine the return of a lover
The smile of a child who's waking up
A page of life at daybreak

My love, take my hand
From tomorrow on, we'll be one
Don't be afraid anymore
Don't hesitate and follow me

If you want, we'll live - you, the music and I
Yes, simply you, the music and I
In another universe above the clouds
If you want, we'll live - you, the music and I
Yes, simply you, the music and I
In a new world, almost unreal

We'll live - you, the music and I
Yes, simply you, the music and I
In another universe above the clouds
If you want, we'll live - you, the music and I
Yes, simply you, the music and I
In a new world, almost unreal

The music and I
The muѕic аnd I
