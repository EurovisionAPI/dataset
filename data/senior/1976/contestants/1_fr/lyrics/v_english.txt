One, two, three

One, two, three
I can count easily
And those figures could be
Adding up to so much more to me, whoa…

One, two, three
Adding you next to me
Can make two and two three

If I can count on having you around
Lift me up when I am down
Always there to help when I appeal
Shouldering with me each heavy wheel

Once we join, we won't divide
All my hopes, I multiply
Ever since we met, I wanted to
Feel I could keep counting on you

One, two, three (One, two, three)
It can happen so quick (Oh so quick)
Simple arithmetic
Simply you plus me can do the trick, yes

One, two, three (One, two, three)
That's what life is about (Is about)
I have figured it out

If I can count on having you around
Lift me up when I am down
Always there to help when I appeal
Shouldering with me each heavy wheel

Once we join, we won't divide
All my hopes, I multiply
Ever since we met, I wanted to
Feel I could keep counting on you

La la la…

Once we join, we won't divide
All my hopes, I multiply
Ever since we met, I wanted to
Feel I could keep counting
On not juѕt аnyone
But keep on counting on you
