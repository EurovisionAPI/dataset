One, two, three

One, two, three
My own policy
Is to be loved by you
And to sing lalala lala lala…

One, two, three
For me, life is not
A book by Kafka
One, two, three

Play, play, musicians
Delight me, magicians
Make my head spin, spin
Make the eyes of the king-children shine

Make me dream, comedian
Sing, dance, entertainer
Take me off into the crazy circle
Give me love and joy

One, two, three (One, two, three)
May it rain on the roofs (On the roofs)
May it snow on the woods
It's so nice in your arms, lala lala…

One, two, three (One, two, three)
I only hear your voice (Only your voice)
I only live for you
I love you

Play, play, musicians
Delight me, magicians
Make my head spin, spin
Make the eyes of the king-children shine

Make me dream, comedian
Sing, dance, entertainer
Take me off into the crazy circle
Give me love and joy

La la la…

Make me dream, comedian
Sing, dance, entertainer
Take me off into the crazy circle
Sol mi sol sol fa mi…
Sol mi sol ѕol fa mi…
Give me love аnd joy
