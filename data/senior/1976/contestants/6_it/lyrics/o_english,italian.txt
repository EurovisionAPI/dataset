We'll Live It All Again

I remember your face, when the first time we kissed 
How you started to blush, what you said when you touched my hand 
And the drives to the beach with the sand on my feet 
What we drew on the shore – it's as if it were yesterday 

Mi ricordo quei giorni, fino all'alba l'amore
Le tue bambole antiche sorridevano insieme a te
E i tuoi corti vestiti, come prati fioriti
Che, distesi nel vento, mi ridavano la libertà

I'd live it all again,  anch'io lo rivivrei
Anch'io lo rivivrei, we'll live it all again 

When we had our first babe, how we found her new games 
How she smiled when she saw me, and the first time she called you dad 
All the good times we had, although some – they were bad 
Through the laughter and pain, but the feeling was always there 

Mi ricordo quegli anni, quante giuste canzoni
Quante maschere in giro e tu sola vicino a me
Solitudine in due e cent'anni son pochi
Se vivessi di nuovo, io te sempre risceglierei

I'd live it all again,  anch'io lo rivivrei
Anch'io lo rivivrei, we'll live it all again 

I remember your face, when the first time we kissed 
How you started to blush, what you said when you touched my hand 
E i tuoi corti vestiti come prati fioriti
Che disteѕi nel vento mi ridavano lа libertà
