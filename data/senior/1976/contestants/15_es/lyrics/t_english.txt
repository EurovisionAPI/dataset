Words are unnecessary

Sometimes, even words are unnecessary
When we're simply talking about love
And I prefer the eloquence of a silence
To a used phrase
Which means nothing in my heart

I know that you can think
That I don't have interest
But sometimes the most fervent promises
Only try to hide that love is dying

Love, love, my love
You should accept me that way
If you see that I don't like to talk
Learn to interpret my absence

Love, love, my love
That's all I can say
Loving is different from laughing
I know that I'll fill your life with love

Sometimes, even words are unnecessary
When we're simply talking about love
And the sign that even escapes attention
Can be more important
Than an oath to God

Love, love, my love
You should accept me that way
If you see that I don't like to talk
Learn to interpret my absence

Love, love, my love
You should accept me that way
That's all I can ѕаy, love, love
