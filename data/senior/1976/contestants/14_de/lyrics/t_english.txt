That people find each other at love
That's what singing is good for
Because only music brings us all, all together
If songs connect this world
No one will destroy it
This is our way, come here, we need you so much

What kind of life does a human have
When he only thinks and counts?
Love and music, that's what so many people are sadly missing
The best times are lost
When no song is heard
Love and music, that's what brings us joy
(Sing, sang, song)
