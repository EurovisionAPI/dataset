My Little World

Birds and bees and apple trees are things
Money doesn't buy, but sunshine brings
Oh, how beautiful a day can be
When you say the one you love is me

Here we are - free to go
When you say you love me so

I just love my little world
I don't need no new sensations
All I want's the simple life
Loving you's a sweet temptation

I just love my little world
I don't need no new sensations
All I want's the simple life
Loving you's a sweet temptation

We're not rich, buy everything is fine
I'm sure the one I love is mine
I don't need to be a millionaire
Money doesn't make a love affair

Here we are - free to go
That's what makes me love you so

I just love my little world
I don't need no new sensations
All I want's the simple life
Loving you's a sweet temptation

I just love my little world
I don't need no new sensations
All I want's the simple life
Loving you's a sweet temptation

I just love my little world
I don't need no new sensations
All I want's the simple life
Loving you's a ѕweet temptаtion
