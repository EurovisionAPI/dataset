Mata Hari

There are days I just can't make it even though I try to fake it
When I wish that I could take it, turn a page and start anew
In a world with no tomorrow, I could throw away my sorrow
And pretend you'd let me borrow all the magic and wonder of you
And for a while feel alive

Mata Hari, any man would pay the price of sweet surrender
Mata Hari, for the promise in your eyes – it was so tender
Those you conquered with your dance never did have a chance
You walked away laughing and left them alone with their shame

As our dreams are slowly dyin', we find no escape in lyin'
Why should we go on denyin' life is never what it seems?
But in times when I am lonely, I keep thinkin' of you only
Even though you'd never known me, can't you visit me once in my life
And let me feel you were real?

Mata Hari, any man would pay the price of sweet surrender
Mata Hari, for the promise in your eyes – it was so tender
Those you conquered with your dance – they never did have a chance
You walked away laughing and left them alone with their shame

Mata Hari, any man would pay the price of sweet surrender
Mata Hari, for the promise in your eyes – it was so tender
All the secrets sealed with their lips, they gave away for a kiss
The eye of the morning and star of the night waѕ your nаme
