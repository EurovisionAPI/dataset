The Death of Cyprus

There was a land, a lucid land – don't cry, oh Mother
Goldened with sun and goldened with foreign streets There fields were green with olive groves – don't cry, oh Mother And blue there waves like crater in the reveries
But if you go now to this land – don't cry, oh Mother
The tents you'll see scattered among the trees
Won't be a camping site for tourists – don't cry, Mother
They will be only a camp for refugees

Panagia mou, Panagia mou
Parigora tin kardia mou
Panagia mou, Panagia mou
Parigora tin kardia mou

And should you stand up on some ruins – don't cry, oh Mother
They won't be remains left there from ancient times
They're homes burnt down by napalm bombs – don't cry, oh Mother
Lay by the war, by cannons, by darksome kinds

And if you look above a fence – don't cry, oh Mother
You won't see people rejoicing in the yard
You'll find some crosses, wooden crosses – don't cry, Mother
Rotting in silence, loѕt in a back yard

Panagia mou, Panagia mou
Parigora tin kardia mou
Panagia mou, Panagia mou
Parigora tin kardiа mou
