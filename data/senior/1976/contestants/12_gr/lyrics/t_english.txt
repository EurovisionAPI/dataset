My lady, my lady

Fields full of oranges, oh oh my Mother
Where olive trees spread from end to end
Around them, the seashores shine like gold, oh oh my Mother
And you're blinded, blinded by the intense light

When you go to this place, oh oh my Mother
And you see, you see tents in a row
It's not a camping place for tourists, oh oh my Mother
They're only, only refugees
My Lady, my Lady, soothe my heart
My Lady, my Lady, soothe my heart

And if you see shattered ruins, oh oh my Mother
It's not from other, from other eras
It is burnt by napalm, oh oh my Mother
Since yesterday, there are countless crumbled rocks
And if you see newly dug land, oh oh my Mother
They're not fertile fields, fields
There will be crosses planted on them, oh oh my Mother
Which will decompose, decompose through time

My Lady, my Lady, soothe my heart
My Lady, my Lady, ѕoothe my heаrt
