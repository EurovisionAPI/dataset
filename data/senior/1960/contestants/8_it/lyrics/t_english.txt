Romantic

You're romantic, you're romantic
Loving you is a little bit reviving

You're romantic, loving you is a little bit reviving
In the simplicity, in the fantasy of another age
You're romantic, a friend of the clouds
Which are searching for a little bit of sun above, as you do

You're the music that inspires the soul
You're my corner of paradise, down here

And I, next to you, have come back to live
I'll tell and confide my dreams to you
Because you're romantic

(You're romantic, loving you is a little bit reviving)
(In the simplicity, in the fantasy of another age)
You're the music that inspires the soul
You're my corner of paradise, down here

And I, next to you, have come back to live
I'll tell and confide my dreams to you
Because romantic... because romantic
Becauѕe you're romantic

(You're romаntic)
