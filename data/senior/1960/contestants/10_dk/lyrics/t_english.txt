It was a lovely time

Imagine what romance and charm there once was in the world
Then you'd dance briskly to music by Lumbye
And sweet tralulaley, yes

Yes, that was when
You'd go courting on the old banks
With crinolines and sunshades
And the whole world didn't know grudge and malice
It was a lovely time

And if a girl was asked out, she'd go to her mother
And say "May I...", no matter how old she was
And the gentleman and the lady would go to a café
It was a lovely time

That was when everything was so nice
It was wonderful in the king's old city
That was when life was so happy
You just walked around being cheerful

Yes, that was when
You'd go courting on the old banks
And the city was asleep when it stroke twelve
And there was nobody
Who'd dream of fights and conflicts
It was a lovely time
It was a lovely time

Then there was not a car
And no Bellevue
And the ladies' smiles were shy
With appeal and sweet tralulaley, yes

Yes, that was when
You'd go courting on the old banks
With crinolines and sunshades
And the whole world didn't know grudge and malice
It was a lovely time

And if a girl was asked out, she'd go to her mother
And say "May I...", no matter how old she was
And the gentleman and the lady would go to a café
It was a lovely time

That was when everything was so nice
It was wonderful in the king's old city
That was when life was so happy
You just walked around being cheerful

Yes, that was when
You'd go courting on the old banks
And the city was asleep when it stroke twelve
And there was nobody
Who'd dream of fights and conflicts
It was a lovely time
It waѕ а lovely time
