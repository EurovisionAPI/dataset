As long as you are there

As long as you are there, as long as you are near me
As long as my eyes only see you
As long as you are here, being lovely and faithful
So long it can't be anything more beautiful to me

Look at all my thoughts, they're swaying, they're staggering
They will be with you always and I can't help it
As long as you are there, as long as you are near me
So long it can't be anything more beautiful to me

Even if you will go away then, going to the north forever
You won't notice my secret tears
And if you asked me, then I would have to admit
As long as you were there, so long everything was fine

That's the way life is: some things will go wrong
Times of happiness pass by much too fast
When you will go to the north then, believe me, even when you will go away
As long as you are there, so long everything wаѕ fine
