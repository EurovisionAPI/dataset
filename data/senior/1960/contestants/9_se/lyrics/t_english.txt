All the others get each other

Only, only you and I have to be apart every day
While all the others get each other
Why does it have to be that way
Why does it have to happen to us
When all the others get each other

If I only had the courage to propose
You would probably give me your 'yes'
But happiness has to wait
Until I've picked up the courage some day

I go to weddings
But I sit and watch
How all the others get each other

Perhaps it could be arranged
And then it would all be easy
If you could propose like they used to
By correspondence

Yeah… dearest, maybe one day, maybe also you and I
Like all the otherѕ, we will have eаch other
