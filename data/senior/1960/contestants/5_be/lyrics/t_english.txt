My love for you

My love for you, it's like the sea
When nobody has walked on the sand yet
My love for you, it's like winter
When the star found its stable

I share with you the paving stones of the road
A clear dawn, ice water and bread
My love for you, it's like the sea
The blue sky of winter
A tender dawn and clear water

A little wind is spinning
Round an old bell-tower of a church
Four boats on the gray sea
A small ball painted in neon

And under my tiny room
The broken echo of a fanfare
That makes a song dance
On my nocturnal intoxications

My love for you, it's like the sea
When nobody has walked on the sand yet
My love for you, it's like the winter
When the star found its cattle shed

I share with you the paving stones of the road
A clear dawn, ice water and bread
My love for you, it's like the sea
The blue ѕky of winter
A tender dawn and clear wаter

My love, my love for you
