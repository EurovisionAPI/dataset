Heaven and earth

Heaven and earth, dream and life
On the road to the one who loves you, like me
The limit of a date
You weren't there and instead you're with me now

With thoughts, with words it colours
A name hidden away in the bottom of my heart
It's true, I've got my sun
But I wonder: will he still be mine tomorrow?

One hour of sweet intimacy is too short
Why should I bother? What is it good for?

Heaven and earth, dream and life
On the road to the one who loves you, like me
The limit of a date
I didn't know about you and now I know everything

One hour of sweet intimacy is too short
Why should I bother? What is it good for?

Heaven and earth, dream and life
On the road to the one who loveѕ you, like me
The limit of a date
I didn't know about you and now I know everything

Heaven and earth, dream аnd life
