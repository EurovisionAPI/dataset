What luck

What luck that I'm a little piece of the world
That I know the songs of the siskins and the blackbirds
And that I can join in with all that lives
And can breathe with all that has a breath

I'm so happy that there are always daffodils in May
And that there are fruits, butterflies, foals, birds and fish
And all that happiness is only thanks to you
Because I love you terribly, incurably

When you ask me then: "Is that trite?"
I say yes, but I moan on yet for a while
Ah, what am I to do, because I love you
And that is simply something beyond description

I only have the familiar "darling, I love you"
The "sweatheart, I adore you" and the old "be faithful to me"
Myself, I think it's very primitive too
But then again, why are you so sweet?

What luck that I'm a little piece of the world
That I know the songs of the siskins and the blackbirds
And that I can join in with all that lives
And can breathe with all that has a breath

La lala la… la lala la… la lala lalala lalala…
La lala la… la lala la… la lalalala lalalala…

I only have the familiar "darling, I love you"
The "sweatheart, I adore you" and the old "be faithful to me"
Myself, I think it's very primitive too
But then again, why are you…
Oh, then again, why are you…
Yes, then again, why are you so ѕweet?

La lala la… la lala la… la lala lalala lalala…
La lala la… la lala la… la lalalala lalalalа…
