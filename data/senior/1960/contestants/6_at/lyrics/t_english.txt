You fascinated me so much

Was it at the Place du Dôme?
Was it in Madrid or in Rome?
What's the use for asking
For long passed days?
I still hear me saying:

You fascinated me so much
That nothing interested me but to dream about you at night
You fascinated me so much
That I love nothing in the world but you, honey

You fascinated me so much
Yes, you hypnotized me
So that I don't know what I'm doing
And what happened then
Because you fascinated me so much

Is it really such a long time ago?
You even don't remember it?
Oh... that is unpossible
Because it was so indescribable
I told you every day:

You fascinated me so much
That nothing interested me but to dream about you at night
You fascinated me so much
That I like nothing in the world but you, honey

You fascinated me so much
Yes, you hypnotized me
So that I don't know what I'm doing
And what happens then
Because you fascinated me so much

Unfortunately I hаve to include one thing:
Everybody knowѕ it, but you
