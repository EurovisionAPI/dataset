I don't know what to give

If I'd lose you, I don't know what I'll do
I'll remember forever, every minute
I lived with you

My hands are empty, but
I don't hide the love that I'll always feel for you
In the bottom of my heart I don't know why
I would embrace you one more time

I don't know what I can give to stop the time
To sleep beside you only for one night
I don't know what I can give
To take you close to me only for one night

Then the stars and the moon and you
With the wings of a swan will fly down

My hands are empty, but
I don't hide the love that I'll always feel for you
In the bottom of my heart I don't know why
I would embrace you one more time

I don't know what I can give to stop the time
To sleep beside you only for one night
I don't know what I can give
To take you close to me only for one night

I don't know what I can give to stop the time
To sleep beside you only for one night
I don't know what I can give
To take you close to me only for one night

I don't know what I can give to stop the time
To sleep beside you only for one night
I don't know what I can give
To tаke you cloѕe to me only for one night
