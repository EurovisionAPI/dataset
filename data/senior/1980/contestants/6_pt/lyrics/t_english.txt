A big, big love

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Love, love, my love, love of my life
If our love ends, you'll only see me singing
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Love, love, my love, love of my life
Ooh… ah…

This love doesn't have grids, borders
Barriers, Berlin wall
It's a sea, it's a river, it's a fountain
That grows inside of me
It's the shout of my universe
Of the stars to which I return
Where this music always floats in the air

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Love, love, my love, love of my life
If our love ends, you'll only see me singing
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Love, love, my love, love of my life

This love is a free bird
Flying in the blue sky
Which composed the most beautiful song
Of this world from north to south
And the words I use in the chorus
Are part of the same song
Which echoes in the galаxies of my illusion

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Love, love, my love, love of my life
If our love ends, you'll only see me singing
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Love, love, my love, love of my life

(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye) A big love
(Love, love, my love, love of my life) Love of my life
If our love ends, you'll only see me ѕinging
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Love, love, my love, love of my life
