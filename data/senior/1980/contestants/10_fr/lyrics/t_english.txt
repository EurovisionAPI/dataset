Hey hey gentlemen ladies

Dududu dududu… dududu dududu dudu…
Hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
If we sang the whole night long
To laugh and to scare our cares away
It's party today

Hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
We go for a walk on the music scale
Our heart filled with notes in flames
To warm up our souls

We'll sing, hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
We'll dance, hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
Everyone unveils himself, tonight it's the ball
It's the carnival, the carnival

Dududu dududu… dududu dududu dudu…
Hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
Outside in the twinkling night
All the lamps are shining
In the eyes of the girls

Hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
We have the right to be a little crazy
Laugh nose to nose, cheek to cheek
Mock everything

We'll sing, hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
We'll dance, hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
Do what pleases us, tonight it's the ball
It's the carnival, the carnival

Dududu dududu… dududu dududu dudu…
Hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
Tonight money is forbidden
We throw coins and notes
Like confetti

Hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
The fear for tomorrow is gone
And we'll be feeling good for a long time
Hand in hand

We'll sing, hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
We'll dance, hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
Finally we're living our life, tonight it's the ball
It's the carnival, the carnival

Hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
We'll sing, hey, hey, gentlemen, ladies
Finally we're living our life, tonight it's the ball
It's the carnival, the carnival

Hey hey, gentlemen, ladies
We'll dance, hey hey, gentlemen, ladies
Finally we're living our life, tonight it's the ball
It'ѕ the carnival, the carnivаl

Dududu dududu dudu…
