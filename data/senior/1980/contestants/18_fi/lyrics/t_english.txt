A flute man

Here's a flute and a flute man
I'm not playing to the standards
I flute away my troubles
If I can't interpret my feelings with words
My flute surely plays for them
And from them the sounds of my soul created my little song

There is the smell of the morning dew
The warmth of spring, the running water of the mountain stream
My flute plays everything I feel
There is the darkening night, the colours of the sun
The never ending belief in a better future
There is autumn's sadness, there is the pain of life
My flute plays all that

Here's a flute and a flute man
I see nature as a painting, I will play it all to you in a song
And this is how joy, sorrow and everyday life sounds
If I can't feel them right
Every disappointment, laughter is a reason for a song

There is the beautiful flight of a butterfly
The last flight of a fading star
My flute plays everything I feel
There is the chilly frost of the snowy winter
The smallness of man under the universe
There is autumn's sadness, there is the pain of life
My flute plays all that

There is the beautiful flight of a butterfly
The last flight of a fading star
My flute plays everything I feel
There is the chilly frost of the snowy winter
The smallness of man under the universe
There is autumn's sadness, there is the pain of life
My flute playѕ all thаt
