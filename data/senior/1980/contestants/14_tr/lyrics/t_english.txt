Pet'r Oil

Before you came it was dark everywhere
The world was empty and dull, I wonder why
I searched everywhere for sweet light
For a flame that would warm my heart

When you came, as if a sun has dawned
Illuminating my day and night, my life was wonderful
Now, all of a sudden, everything has changed
Without you, life is difficult and hard

Lovely pet'r oil, sweet pet'r oil
I need you now, pet'r oil
Lovely pet'r oil, sweet pet'r oil
I need you now, pet'r oil

In the beginning, pet'r oil, in the end pet'r oil
Now my reigns are in your hands, pet'r oil
In the beginning, pet'r oil, in the end pet'r oil
Now my reigns are in your hands, pet'r oil

You are so proud, I can't come close to you
I wonder who else suffers from your love
You speak of nothing but dollars and marks
I am so suffering because of you

Rich courtesans are running after you
Dreams and reality are not the same, you won't be mine
Maybe you'll go away for good some day
I already started crying after you

Lovely pet'r oil, sweet pet'r oil
I need you now, pet'r oil
Lovely pet'r oil, sweet pet'r oil
I need you now, pet'r oil

In the beginning, pet'r oil, in the end pet'r oil
Now my reigns are in your hands, pet'r oil
In the beginning, pet'r oil, in the end pet'r oil
Now my reigns are in your hаnds, pet'r oil

(Lovely pet'r oil, sweet pet'r oil)
(I need you now, pet'r oil)
Lovely pet'r oil, ѕweet pet'r oil
I need you now, pet'r oil
