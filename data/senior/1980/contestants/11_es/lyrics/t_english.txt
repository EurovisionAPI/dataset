Stay tonight

Sleep beside me tonight
Stay beside me tonight
Love me a lot tonight
I'll be yours tonight

Sleep beside me tonight
Stay beside me tonight
Love me a lot tonight
I'll be yours tonight

Put away the keys and put the suitcase
Back in its place again
Think you don't have to get angry
And even less about leaving without saying why

Come into my arms and tell me what happened
I want to save our love
If perhaps maybe I made a mistake
I want to say I'm sorry

Sleep beside me tonight
Stay beside me tonight
Love me a lot tonight
I'll be yours tonight

Leave your things and come
We'll talk later
And now stay here
I want to tell you how much I need you, my love

Together we'll see
Through this large window
The morning coming and sitting down on your feet
When you're enjoying, my love

Sleep beside me tonight
Stay beside me tonight
Love me a lot tonight
I'll be yours tonight

Sleep beside me tonight
Stay beside me tonight
Love me a lot tonight
I'll be yours tonight

Sleep beside me tonight
Stay beside me tonight
Love me а lot tonight
I'll be yourѕ tonight
