Eurovision

Beautiful ladies, beautiful gentlemen
Music on the programme
Singers, get ready
May the best win

The borders are open
What should I say if tonight is a party?
The stars are nervous
They do their make up
Smoke a cigarette
Before going on stage

Eurovision, Eurovision, Eurovision
Eurovision, Eurovision, Eurovision

Old Europe cheers the country that wins
Then a tear, the spell is broken

The eyes of the whole world are waiting, impatiently
For news flashes
That are going to announce
By satellite and by shielded cables
What's hаppening in their regions

Eurovision, Eurovision, Eurovision
Eurovision, Eurovision, Eurovision

Eurovision, Eurovision, Euroviѕion
