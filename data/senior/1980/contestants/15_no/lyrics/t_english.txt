Sami Land

A simple tune, two small words: Sami Land, Sami earth
It came with the wind from north, from north, Sami Land

Can a demand get any softer: Sami Land, the land of the Sami people
It grew from a breeze to a storm, from a breeze to a storm, Sami Land

In front of the parliament where they sat, Sami Land, Sami Land
The yoik was heard day and night, Sami Land

In front of the parliament where they sat, oy…
The yoik was heard day and night, Sami Land

Yoik is stronger than gunpowder, Sami Land
Because a yoik never ends, oh… Sami Land

Because a yoik never endѕ, Sami Lаnd
