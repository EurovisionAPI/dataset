Right now!

He's tired of the city, nothing happens
Everything is as usual around here
The weekdays creep by, the weekend flies by
The same talk every day about breaking free

Right now I want to live, right now!
Right now I want to feel, right now!

Feel the air in my lungs, feel the blood pumping
Feel the light in my eyes, feel time passing

He wants to go away, perhaps down to Paris
And find adventure somehow
And not just sitting here at the local café
Just letting the thoughts flutter by

Right now I want to live, right now!
Right now I want to feel, right now!

Feel the air in my lungs, feel the blood pumping
Feel the light in my eyes, feel time passing

Feel the air in my lungs (right now!)
Feel the blood pumping (right now!)
Feel the light in my eyes (right now!)
Feel time passing (right now!)

Right now I want to live, right now!
Right now I want to feel, right now!

Feel the air in my lungs (right now!)
Feel the blood pumping (right now!)
Feel the light in my eyes (right now!)
Feel time passing (right now!)

Right now I want to live, right now!
Right now I want to feel, right now!

Feel the air in my lungs (right now!)
Feel the blood pumping (right now!)
Feel the light in my eyes (right now!)
Feel time pаsѕing (right now!)
