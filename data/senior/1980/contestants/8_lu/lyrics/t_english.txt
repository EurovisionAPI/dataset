Papa Pingouin

Papa penguin, papa penguin
Papa, papa, papa penguin
Papa penguin is bored on the ice floe
Papa penguin, papa penguin
Papa, papa, papa penguin
Papa penguin wants to pack his suitcase

He feels nervous, a little unhappy
Doesn't feel very well in his feathers
To calm down his nerves, he dives into the sea
He envies the bird that is flying up there next to the moon
He has lead feet, it makes him grumpy
(Pa papapa papapa papapa…)
(Papapa papapa papapa papapa…)

Papa penguin, papa penguin
Papa, papa, papa penguin
Papa penguin is bored on the ice floe
Papa penguin, papa penguin
Papa, papa, papa penguin
Papa penguin wants to pack his suitcase

On the blue snow he makes an insecure step and slips on the ice
He murmurs: "I want to leave"
Very high in the sky, closer to the sun, crossing space
"I have wings of a bird, I can fly high"
(Pa papapa papapa papapa…)
(Papapa papapa papapa papapa…)

But look papa, why do you say that?
You know that the wings
Of penguins and mills are good for nothing
But why, papa, go there?
Here life is beautiful
Leave the sky to the angels and the saints, come, papa
Papapa papapa papapa…
Papapa papapa papapa…

Papa penguin, papa penguin
Papa, papa, papa penguin
Papa penguin pursues his wonderful dream

Look  how he pretends to be a big seagull, he makes long journeys
He travels down south as far as England
And here's Paris, Rome and Naples, the shores of Carthage
And the Mediterranean, how beautiful is the summer
(Pa papapa papapa papapa…)
(Papapa papapa papapa papapa…)

But look papa, don't you think about it?
You know very well that wings
Of penguins and mills are good for nothing
But why, papa, go there?
Here life is beautiful
If you leave, you won't go very far, stay here
Papapa papapa papapa…
Papapa papapa papapa papapa…

Papa penguin, papa penguin
Papa, papa, papa penguin
Papa penguin gives up his fantasy
Papa penguin, papa penguin
Papa, papa, papa penguin
Papa penguin comes back down to earth

(Papa penguin, papa penguin)
(Papa, papa, papa penguin)
(Papa penguin loves his ice floe)
Papa penguin, papa penguin
Papa, papa, papa penguin
Papa penguin is going to burn his suitcaѕe

(Papa penguin, papa penguin)
Papa, papa, papа penguin
