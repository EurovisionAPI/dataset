Hitch-hiking

If you want to see the world with me, set out (set out)
And make with hitch-hiking the tour of the Earth
You can go where you want, Europe or China (China)
And say "bye Athens" and wherever you'll be found

And go with hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking
Journey with hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking begin smilingly
Hitch-hiking, with hitch-hiking
The frontiers are open and we are a company
The streets with hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking
Are ours with hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking and the world is a drop
Hitch-hiking, with hitch-hiking we'll go everywhere, so long
With hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking

Beijing, Vladivostok, Paris, London
With a small sac-voyage see the world
Stockholm, Cairo, Madrid, Rome, Berlin
Roulette seems to be the tour of the earth

And go with hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking
Journey with hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking, begin smiling
Hitch-hiking, with hitch-hiking
The frontiers are open and we are a company
The streets with hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking
Are ours with hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking and the world is a drop
Hitch-hiking, with hitch-hiking we'll go everywhere, so long
With hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking

And go with hitch-hiking, hey, la la la la la lа…
Hitch-hiking, with hitch-hiking we'll go everywhere, ѕo long
With hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking, hitch-hiking
