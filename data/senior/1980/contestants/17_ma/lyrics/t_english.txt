Love Card

We are the children of the whole world
Asking for a happy, peaceful life
Without grudges, without fire
And without a quarrel between neighbour and neighbour

We are the children of the whole world
Asking for a happy, peaceful life
Without grudges, without fire
And without a quarrel between neighbour and neighbour

A place with no colour discrimination
And our roots are one, all of us are siblings
We don't want neither wars nor pain
We want a life full of peace

A place with no colour discrimination
And our roots are one, all of us are siblings
We don't want neither wars nor pain

A place where there's safety, justice and welfare
Where there's loyalty and so much love
A love card with warm greetings
A beautiful machmoun from every continent

With her hope, all of our hope
Oh world, answer the call
We are the children of the whole world
Aѕking for a happy, peaceful life
