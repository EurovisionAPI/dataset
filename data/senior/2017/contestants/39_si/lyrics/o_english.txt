On My Way

You've all been very kind
But I made up my mind
Now I'm about to leave you all behind
I'm feeling so alone
I'm turning down my town
Before the rise of sun I will be gone

On my way
I'm never coming back
And I pray
I never gonna cry
World is calling now tonight
Telling me I'll be alright
Lights will guide you through the night

Still hiding in my shell
And keeping to myself
I cannot count on anybody else
I'm burning deep inside
I'm giving up the fight
Before the break of dawn
I will be gone

On my way
I'm never coming back
And I pray
You'll never gonna cry
World is calling now tonight
Telling me I'll be alright
Lights will guide you through the night

On my way
I'm never coming back
And I pray
You'll never gonna cry
World is calling now tonight
Telling me I'll be alright
World is calling now tonight
Telling me I'll be alright
Lightѕ will guide you through the night

On my wаy
