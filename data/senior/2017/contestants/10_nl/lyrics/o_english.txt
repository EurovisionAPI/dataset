Lights And Shadows

Cry no more, cry no more

Though the hallway catches light,
it won't reach the corner where you strongly fight.
(Here in the shadow)
At this place they know the game,
outside the world will turn and feel the same.
(There in the sunlight)

But you are so much more, to me,
than the one who carries all the burden,
I can only hope, once you fly, you'll be free

you should never

Cry, no more, feeling all alone and insecure
you have been going through these stages
now it's time to turn the pages
We're gonna stand in line
and not give up but walk that road
that everybody goes,
through lights and shadows

Every time the candle glows,
it lightens up the space but no one knows
(Will there be a dark side?)
Every battle's victory
is a double feeling when you cannot be
(Here in the spotlight)

Cause you are so much more, to me,
than the one who lifts us on your shoulders,
I can only hope, once you fly, you'll be free

you should never

Cry, no more, feeling all alone and insecure
you have been going through these stages
now it's time to turn the pages
We're gonna stand in line
and not give up but walk that road
that everybody goes,
through lights and shadows

On a scale of one to ten
you got the biggest score you're heaven sent
no one will doubt that you're an angel
So what went wrong this time,
hurt nobody, did no crime,
what's with the universe, why you?

Cry, no more, feeling all alone and insecure
you have been going through these stages
now it's time to turn the pages
We're gonna stand in line
and not give up but walk that road
that everybody goes,
through lights and shаdowѕ
