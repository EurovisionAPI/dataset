Space

Linen is covered with feathers
Wet dreams, wild nightmares, I surrender
Come in to me from within
We can be as one in the sin

The spaceship is ready to blow
Drunk in love I'm gonna explode
Be my Bonnie, we'll mix and match with Clyde
Let's explore this galaxy of stars
Let's explore this galaxy of stars

I have my suit on, no need to worry
Give me your body, let's write a story
Our body language
Rocket to the stars

I have my suit on, no need to worry
Give me your body, let's write a story
Our body language
Rocket to the stars

Show me your super powers,
I'm Venus and Mars of the hour
I'll protect you if you come my way
Let's soar through the Milky Way

I have my suit on, no need to worry
Give me your body, let's write a story
Our body language
Rocket to the stars

I have my suit on, no need to worry
Give me your body, let's write a story
Our body language
Rocket to the stars

I have my suit on, no need to worry
Give me your body, let's write a story
Our body language

We're taking off
We're taking off
We're taking off

In space we can be аѕ one
