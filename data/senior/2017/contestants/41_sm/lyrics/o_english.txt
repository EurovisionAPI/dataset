Spirit Of The Night

♂ Hey, are you the one I dream about?
♀ Baby I am
♂ I really feel the night can take away my doubt
♀ I'll try and do what I can 
♂ Every time I see you smile there is sadness in your eyes
♀ Well I've been hurt before 
♂ I know it's nothing new, and time will make you realize
♀ We always wish for more

We find we're searching high and low and always looking for the right time
Together we – can – make it through the night	

It's the spirit of the night	
Spirit of the night
Burning like St. Elmo's fire	
Spirit of the night
Takes our feelings so much higher
♀ It's the spirit of the night	
♂ We can live our fantasy 
Spirit of the night
Burning in our ecstasy

♂ Hey, are you the one to take my pain
♀ Just take my hand
♂ I've been so hurt before, it's hard to trust again
♀ You know I understand
♂ You've got me feeling right, and I can see the future is bright
♀ I'll take your blues away
So no more searching high and low and always looking for the right time

Together we (we) – can (can) – make it trough the night

It's the spirit of the night	
Spirit of the night
Burning like St. Elmo's fire	
Spirit of the night
Takes our feelings so much higher
♂ Feed our deep desire

♀ It's the spirit of the night	
♂ It's a feeling – got me reeling	
♂ We can live our fantasy 
♀ It's the spirit of the night	
♂ It's a feeling, just a feeling
♂ Burning in our ecstasy

♀ Time to celebrate our love, we're caught in it's ray of light
♂ Calling to the world out loud, just let our spirits fly
we can write another page a golden age within our lifetime
