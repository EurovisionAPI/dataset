Hey Mamma

Hey, hey you
You won't ever hide what you think of me
I see your clue
No, you worry about me, don't need to be

Hey, hey you
It's a girl and maybe she'll sleep at home
But I steal her alone

And I say mamma, mamma, don't be so down
I'm not that defendant boy
Mamma, mamma, don't be so down
All the kids going round and round

Mamma, mamma, don't be so mad
If you knew me you'd be surprised
Mamma, mamma, don't be so mad
(She'll be back home till sunrise)

Like the sun in the sea
She will disappear tonight with me
I know we're not anymore
Do what other cats did before

Hey, hey you (Hey you)
It's a girl and maybe she'll sleep at home
But I steal her alone

And I say mamma, mamma, don't be so down
I'm not that defendent boy
Mamma, mamma, don't be so down
All the kids going round and round

Mamma, mamma, don't be so mad
If you knew me you'd be surprised
Mamma, mamma, don't be so mad
(She'll be back home till sunrise)

(Mamma, mamma, ma…)
(Mamma, mamma, ma…) Oh, mamma, mamma, ma…
(Mamma, mamma, ma…)
(Mamma, mamma, mamma)

(Mamma, mamma, ma…)
(Mamma, mamma, ma…) Oh, mamma, mamma, ma…
(Mamma, mamma, ma…)
(Mamma, mamma)

And I say mamma, mamma, don't be so down
I'm not that defendent boy
Mamma, mamma, don't be so down
All the kids going round and round

Mamma, mamma, don't be so mad
If you knew me you'd be surprised
Mamma, mamma, don't be so mad
She'll be back home till sunriѕe

Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma…
Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma…
Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma…
Hey mamma, hey mamma (Hey bababa…)

Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma…
Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma…
Hey mamma mа…
