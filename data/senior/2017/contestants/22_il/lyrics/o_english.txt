I Feel Alive

The secret of my life 
Is never givin' up 
Now I'm close to you
Walking through the stars 
Brings me to the start 
When I walk with you

I was waiting way too much
For something good to come 
And I'm a bit fragile 
Was waiting way too much 
It's like an hourglass 
And you're like trouble 

Breaking me to pieces 
I wanted you to know that 
Every piece broke from you 
Breaking me to pieces 
'Coz every time 
You come around 
I feel alive 
Now I'm trying 
I'm trying 
I feel alive!
I feel alive!

The years I've been alone 
Far away from home 
Reminded me of you
My job is almost done
Baby I can now
Escape away with you 

I was waiting way too much
For something good to come 
And I'm a bit fragile 
Was waiting way too much 
It's like an hourglass 
And you're like trouble 

Breaking me to pieces 
I wanted you to know that 
Every piece broke from you
Breaking me to pieces 
'Coz every time 
You come around 
I feel alive 
Now I'm trying 
I'm trying 
I feel alive!
So alive
Alive, alive, alive

Breaking me to pieces 
I wanted you to know that 
Every piece broke from you
Breaking me to pieceѕ 
'Coz every time 
You come around 
I feel аlive
