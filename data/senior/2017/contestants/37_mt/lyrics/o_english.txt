Breathlessly

I walk the street
Leaving footprints in your heart
My feet are worn
But they can handle the cold

I know the game
I'll take the blame
I wave my white flag unashamed

So, here I am
Right at your door
Catching my breath before the storm

Breathlessly
I'll be watching you breathlessly
Knowing there's a vacancy
Within your heart

Breathlessly
I'll be holding you endlessly
Knowing that the storm
Is just about to die

Climbing over walls
That always felt too high
Breathlessly

I'm stepping out
Yet I feel I'm locked inside
I got the will
I learned the skill
Of a true acrobat for love

Breathlessly
I'll be watching you breathlessly
Knowing there's a vacancy
Within your heart

Breathlessly
I'll be holding you endlessly
Knowing that the storm
Is just about to die

Climbing over walls
That always felt too high
Breаthlesѕly
