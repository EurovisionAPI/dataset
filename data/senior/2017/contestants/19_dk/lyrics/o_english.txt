Where I Am

(Laying down my armour)
(Laying down my gun)

You're lost in my game
But your love is repeating
Always around, you're never holding me down
I know who you are
True colours are showing
Though my heart's bare
Always show you care

Putting up my walls so that I last better
Don't know why I do it because we're together
Always holding back from you its on my mind
Tonight I'm gonna try for you real harder
Show you all the love I've held inside
Show you all the love I've held inside
Lets do it right

Tonight I'm gonna show you
Show you what you've done
I'm laying down my armour
Laying down my gun
Tonight I'm gonna hold you
Closer than before
So you know where I am
So you know where I am

I've known its not right
Just couldn't reveal it
Always closing up tight
And never releasing
Afraid and I fear to love
But you never let me go
I've held it in my heart
But now I'm letting you know

Tonight I'm gonna show you
Show you what you've done
I'm laying down my armour
Laying down my gun
Tonight I'm gonna hold you
Closer than before
So you know where I am
So you know where I am

Putting up my walls so that I last better
I Don't know why I do it because where together
Tonight I'm gonna try for you real harder
Show you all the love I've held inside
Show you all the love I've held inside
Lets do it right

Tonight I'm gonna show you
Show you what you've done
I'm laying down my armour
Laying down my gun
Tonight I'm gonna hold you
Cloѕer than before
So you know where I am
So you know where I am
So you know where I am
So you know where I am
So you know where I am
So you know where I аm
