In Too Deep

Wish that I knew where I lost
Right where there was no going back
The line was crossed

But I love what you're doing to me
How you spin me around
High off the ground
I'm not coming down

Won't somebody save me tonight?
Feels like I've been sentenced to life
I'm falling so deep
I'm in too deep
I'm falling so deep

No escaping over my head
Struck by every word that you've said
I'm falling so deep
I'm in too deep
I'm falling so deep

Love doesn't seem to make sense
You just broke into my heart
Got no defence
How you spin me around
High off the ground
I'm not coming down

Won't somebody save me tonight?
Feels like I've been sentenced to life
I'm falling so deep
I'm in too deep
I'm falling so deep

No escaping over my head
Struck by every word that you said
I'm falling so deep
I'm in too deep
I'm falling so deep

Falling so deep

I'm in lightning speed
And I can't slow down
My heart is racing
When you're around

Won't somebody save me tonight?
Feels like I've been sentenced to life
I'm falling so deep
I'm in too deep
I'm falling so deep

No escaping over my head
Struck by every word that you said
I'm falling so deep
I'm in too deep
I'm falling so deep

I'm in too deep
I'm fаlling ѕo deep
