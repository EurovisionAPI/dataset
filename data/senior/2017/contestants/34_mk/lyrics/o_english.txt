Dance Alone

Take out my hair, wash off my makeup
It's gonna be a one man show
I gotta feel good, infatuation
And I'm the only one who knows

I will dance alone
Wherever I am, the rhythm follows
I will dance alone
I'm lost in the sound of no tomorrow

I let the pavement be my catwalk
Oh bring the fire on, feel the heat
And all I need to keep on moving
Is the sound of my heartbeat

I will dance alone
Wherever I am, the rhythm follows
I will dance alone
I'm lost in the sound of no tomorrow
I let it go
I, I, I let it go, wild
I let it go
I, I, I let it go
I will dance alone
Wherever I am, the rhythm follows

Take me to places that I've never been
Show me the faces that I've never seen

I will dance alone
Wherever I am, the rhythm follows
I will dance alone
I'm lost in the sound of no tomorrow
I will dance alone
I let it go
I, I, I let it go, wild
I let it go
I, I, I let it go, wild
I let it go
I, I, I let it go, wild
I let it go
I, I, I let it go, wild

I'll be dаncing on my own
Wishing you could hold me cloѕe
