My Turn

From the very, very first time I saw you
You were my home, you were my home, you were my home

Now that you are falling, let me be your calling
Be your one prayer, keep away the bad things
In this moment let me give to you what you've given to me
That's the least I can do

Baby, it's you every time I close my eyes
It's always been you
And heaven knows that I'll be waiting always by your side
Baby, it's you every time that I was down
You were there to fix me up, you were there to pick me up
Now it's my turn

From the billion hearts to choose between
Well I was your choice, I was your choice
So let me be your salvation and joy

Now that you are falling, let me be your calling
Be your one prayer, keep away the bad things
In this moment let me give to you what you've given to me
That's the least I can do

Baby, it's you every time I close my eyes
It's always been you
And heaven knows that I'll be waiting always by your side
Baby, it's you every time that I was down
You were there to fix me up, you were there to pick me up
Now it's my turn

You know that I love it when you call just to say hello, oh oh
Will you let me hear it once more?

Baby, it's you every time I close my eyes
It's always been you
And heaven knows that I'll be waiting always by your side, oh yeah
Baby, it's you, uh uh (Every time that I wаs done)
You were there to fix me up, you were there to pick me up
Now it'ѕ my turn
I know
