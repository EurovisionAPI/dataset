Love For Both

If anyone ever wonders about me
Tell them I have lived solely to love you
Before you I only existed
Worn out and with nothing left to give

My love, listen to my pleas
I beg you to come back, to want me again
I know that one can't love by oneself
But maybe with time you will learn to love me as well

My love, listen to my pleas
I beg you to come back, to want me again
I know that one can't love by oneself
But maybe with time you will learn to love me as well

If your heart won't be willing to give in
Won't be willing to feel or to suffer
Without making plans of what will come ahead
My heart can love for both of us inѕteаd
