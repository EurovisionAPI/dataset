Story of My Life

How many days, how many dates
New figures and towns
The Chain of events falls behind us
Keeping in a heart 
and moving on

Story of my life
Will shine brighter
The sun will sparkle in our blood
The entire beauty of your eyes

I will seek you out wherever you may be
To discover vivid impressions rapidly
Present day will become a birth
Of new wills and better thoughts

Story of my life
Will shine brighter
The sun will sparkle in our blood
The entire beаuty of your eyeѕ
