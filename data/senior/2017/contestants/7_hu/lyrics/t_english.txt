Origo

You must close your eyes
So you will see me
To conquer my heart
You must know my soul

If you don't need me, let me go
I was born a vagabond
I have suffered enough
But God sees me, sees me

Jálomá lommá, jálomá lommá
Jálomá lommá lomalom
Jálomá lommá, jálomá nédinná
Jálomá lommá, lomálom

Why did you lie to me
That the color of skin doesn't matter
You know that I have brown eyes
This never changes

I'm not asking you anymore
Get out of here, leave me
I don't to see you
I curse you forever

Jálomá lommá, jálomá lommá
Jálomá lommá lomalom
Jálomá lommá, jálomá nédinná
Jálomá lommá, lomálom

God spoke to me when I was 4 years old
He put a real gun in my hand
I knew only he can take care of me
I practised more than a samurai
I can trust him, He always tells the truth
I cry with him but he shows me the way
This alliance will last forever
It's not expendable, He is the most supreme treasure

Mysterious forces were in the child
They were afraid of him, it shows in their eyes
My strings are attached, the body cries
You defend yourself in vain – the instrument is poisoned
I soak the people with music
You hear my melody, you know my name
The road is long, I have sores on my back
Tears of a thouѕand people are played on my guitar

Jálomá lommá, jálomá lommá
Jálomá lommá lomalom
Jálomá lommá, jálomá nédinná
Jálomá lommá, lomálom

Jálomá lommá, jálomá lommá
Jálomá lommá lomаlom
Jálomá lommá, jálomá nédinná
Jálomá lommá, lomálom
