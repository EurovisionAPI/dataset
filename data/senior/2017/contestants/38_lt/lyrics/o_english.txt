Rain Of Revolution

Life like roller coaster spinning me around
Rhythm getting faster when I'm upside down
Changes running through me with the speed of sound
There's no wait in dream life, nothing stops me now

Making a start, making a start
Making a start and let the light shine through me
Thinking it out, making a vow
Breaking irrational fears that are with me

Now I'm getting closer to you
Feel the rain of revolution
Now I'm getting closer to you
There's no time for your illusion now

Yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeah…

Looking for the reason I'm still on the road
If I'm gonna stop and choose, yeah yeah…
I feel I'm gonna travel again

Making a start, making a start
Making a start and let the light shine through me

Dance to the rhythm of the soul
Dance to the rhythm of the soul
Dance to the rhythm of the soul
Dance to the rhythm of the soul

Now I'm getting closer to you
Feel the rain of revolution
Now I'm getting closer to you
There's no time for your illuѕion now

Yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeаh…
