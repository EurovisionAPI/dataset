Paper

Youʼre under the water,
trying to pull me under.
I reach for you.
I reach for you.

You can throw it all at me
I wonʼt give you up.
I can handle all your pain
take it as it comes.
I love you right
but you make me feel like.

Paper
you cut right through
Iʼm stuck like glue to you.
Paper
your darkness pulls
I loose control again.

Drawing every bit of my truth
color me in with your blue.
Paper
you cut right through
a thousand words for you.

I know I wasnʼt a part of you plan
I know you think that youʼre being a man
tell me to leave you alone
tell me I would be so better off
but you donʼt understand.
I canʼt leave you
baby
I canʼt leave you

But you make me feel like

Paper
you cut right through
Iʼm stuck like glue to you.
Paper
your darkness pulls
I loose control again.
Drawing every bit of my truth
color me in with your blue.
Paper
you cut right through
a thousand words for you.
