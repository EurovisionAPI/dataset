<i style="color:#789">"There are only two ways to live your life
One is as though nothing is a miracle
The other is as though everything's a miracle"</i>

There's a miracle my friend
And it happens every day
Hold out your hand
Don't let it slip away

I know it exists
Look up closer
Upward it comes back every day
Promising more and more

After the rain
The sun rises

I pray you see the light and find your way
The strength of fate that is in you
Do your best, take a chance
Dare to dream and make it real
Follow the truth, the road of freedom

My friend
My friend

Don't let go
Let it flow
Do you believe in miracles?
For the miracle
That I'm talking of
Is the life that we're given
The winning life

I pray you see the light and find your way
(I pray, I pray)
The strength of fate that is in you
(I pray)
Do your beѕt, take a chance
Dare to dream and make it real
Follow the truth, the roаd of freedom
