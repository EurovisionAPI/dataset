Westerners' Karma

To be or ought to be 
The Hamlet-like doubt
As contemporary as Neolithic man
Intelligence is démodé
Easy answers…
Useless dilemmas…

Wanted: tales with a grand finale 
We hope (hope, yes!)
Whatever happens, panta rhei
And singing in the rain

Nirvana lessons
There's Buddha in single line
Yard time for everyone, their time of fame (Allez!)
The crowd chants a mantra
Evolution is stumbling
The naked ape is dancing
Westerners' karma
Westerners' karma
The naked ape is dancing
Westerners' karma

Wanted:
Virtual humanity
Sex appeal (sex appeal)
Whatever happens, panta rhei
And singing in the rain

Nirvana lessons
There's Buddha in single line
Yard time for everyone, their time of fame (Allez!)
The crowd chants a mantra
Evolution is stumbling
The naked ape is dancing
Westerners' karma
Westerners' karma
The naked ape is dancing
Westerners' karma

When life loses focus
Men fall
Westerners' karma
Westerners' karma
The ape rises

Namaste, Allez!
