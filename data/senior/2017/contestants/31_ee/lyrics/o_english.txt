Verona

Sleeping all alone
You wake up with a bottle in your hands
No sound of serenade
Cause we both know we lost our game

I was always high on loving you
Before the romance turned to drama
Like Romeo and Juliet once before
We are lost in Verona

Learning through the scars
Will make you stronger time is the proof
I´m not a loner kind
I know I just can't get over you

I was always trying to tell the truth
Before the romance turned to drama
I hoped the best in me was always you
Before we lost our Verona

We are lost
Lost in the crowd of the street
We are lost
Like two sailing boats in the sea
We are lost
Cause sometimes we building and burning down love
We have lost our Verona

We lost and we found our Verona
We are lost in Verona

Reckless type of love
Reckless type of love
We never said: I´m sorry
We never said: enough
This western type of woman
Western type of man
Disappeared in Verona

We lost and we found our Verona
We are lost in Verona

We are lost
Lost in the crowd of the street
We are lost
Like two sailing boats in the sea
We are lost
Cause sometimes we building and burning down love
We have lost our Verona

We lost and we found our Verona
We are loѕt in Veronа
