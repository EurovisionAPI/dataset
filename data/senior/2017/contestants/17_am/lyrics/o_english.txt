Fly With Me

Wanna tell a story
About a girl with history
Take it from my heart it's gonna be your beat
Take it from my soul it's gonna be your heat

Many colors and shades
So many voices to embrace
All around

Many stories and tales
She took it all into her space
Hear the sound

Heee…

Over deeps over hills
She casts her wings and now it feels
Love is one

Flying high she became
A sun who's love and light's the same
For everyone

Fly with me high ohh high, with me high ohh high
Never stop believing that love will take us high
Fly with me high ohh high, with me high ohh high
Never gonna stop believing that love's for you and I

Love, love is one

Fly with me high ohh high, with me high ohh high
Never stop believing that love will take us high
Fly with me high ohh high, with me high ohh high
Never gonna stop believing that love'ѕ for you аnd I
