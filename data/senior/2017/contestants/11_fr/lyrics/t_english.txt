Requiem

Love dies, love is born
Centuries pass and disappear
What you believe is dead
Is a season and nothing more

One weary day of this wandering
You will go, what does it matter
Because the world will turn again
Even we we don't turn anymore

Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me smile in the middle of a requiem
Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me dance until the time comes again
What he gave

Will you take me to paradise?
With you nothing ever dies
You take my smile and make it bright
Before the night erase the light

I won't go below silver skies
The only dark is in your eyes
We cry but we still survive
That's the beauty of the requiem

The sparks become flames
The little girls become women
What you think is death
Is an inferno and nothing more

Our rips, our declines
We think that they have importance
But tomorrow the day will be reborn
Like if we had not lived

Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me smile in the middle of a requiem
Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me dance until the time comes again
What he gave

Will you take me to paradise?
With you nothing ever dies
You take my smile and make it bright
Before the night erase the light

I won't go below silver skies
The only dark is in your eyes
We cry but we still survive
That's the beauty of the requiem

Love is born, love dies
Tonight I'm finally not afraid
I know that I will love again
When the world doesn't turn anymore

Love is born, love dies
Tonight I'm finally not afraid
I know that I will love again
When the world doesn't turn anymore

Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me smile in the middle of a requiem
Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me dance until the time comes again
What he gave

Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Kiss me
Kiss me, tell me thаt you love me
Kisѕ me
