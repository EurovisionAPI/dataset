Do It for Your Lover

Sometimes it's hard to say all the things you want to 
Sometimes life harms you without even warning you
Sometimes it reminds me of a melody 
So lost and frustrated it won't let you see the daylight 

Do it for your lover, do it for your lover baby, clap your hands and do it for your lover.
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover baby, clap your hands and do it for your lover,
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover,
Do it for those you ever care and love

And love
And love

Hold my hand, don't close that door 
Let the pain and sorrow just go away
Then shout, get out there and fly 
And you'll see it's worth doing it for your loved ones 

So
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover baby, clap your hands and do it for your lover.
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover baby, clap your hands and do it for your lover,
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover,
Do it for those you ever care and love

And love

Just do it, just do it, just do it for your lover
Just do it, just do it, just do it for your lover,
Just do it, just do it, just do it for your lover
Just do it just do it, just do it for your lover.

Do it for your lover, do it for your lover baby, clap your hands and do it for your lover.
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover baby, clap your hands and do it for your lover,
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover,
Do it for those you ever care and love

And love

Oh baby just do it
Oh bаby just do it
Juѕt do it
