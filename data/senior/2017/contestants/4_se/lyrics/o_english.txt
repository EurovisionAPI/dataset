I Can't Go On

I can't go on

Gotta keep it together 

Don't get me wrong

Cause baby you make me better

Hey 

With just one look you make me shiver 
I just wanna take you home 
Wanna go OH 
Yeah I wanna go OOH 

Now girl you make me a believer  
I wanna take off all my clothes   
wanna go OH 
You make me wanna go OH

I just can't go on no more 
When you look this freakin' beautiful

Hands down to the floor my love 
And I'm doing  
Whatever you want

I can't go on I can't go on  
When you look this freakin' beautiful  
I can't go on I can't go on  
When you look this freakin' beautiful

You've got me good 
You've got me good 
And I'm not going nowhere

Right in your hook 
That's understood 
But Im take you to somewhere

I just can't go on no more 
When you look this freakin' beautiful

Hands down to the floor my love 
And I'm doing  
Whatever you want

I can't go on I can't go on  
When you look this freakin' beautiful 

I can't go on I can't go on  
When you look this freakin' beautiful 

So freakin' beautiful  
Baby I just can't go on

I can't go on I can't go on  
When you look this freakin' beautiful 

I can't go on I can't go on  
When you look this freakin' beautiful 

So freakin' beautiful  
Baby I juѕt cаn't go on
