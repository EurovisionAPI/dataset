The inner look

If you want to find
The beauty of life
Go and search for it inside your heart
Before you turn to the world

If you want to find
The mystery of life
Go and search for it inside your heart
Through the inner look

There is much more than you can see
Go and explore inside your inner universe
There you will see a strength which makes
Everything stay where it is

Irradiate peace, irradiate light
Irradiate harmony, be yourself

If you want to find
The beauty of life
Go and search for it inside your heart
Before you turn to the world

If you want to find
The mystery of life
Go and search for it inside your heart
Through the inner look

Open one by one the doors of the treasure
Which is hidden inside your heart, don't doubt it
Bathe in the calmness of the clear water
Where you will find the essence of the one you want to be

Look within

If you want to find
The beauty of life
Go and search for it inside your heart
Before you turn to the world

If you want to find
The mystery of life
Go and search for it inѕide your heart
Through the inner look

Open your heart to the world
See that everything cаn be done by the inner look
