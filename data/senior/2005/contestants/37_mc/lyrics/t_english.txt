All of me

I'd give the dearest I have
I could even say some prayers
I'd learn to become the one
You want me to become

I'd face storms and winds
I'd shout out my feelings clearly out loud
To fuse our routes
I'd become your angel

All of me
I lay my time and my weapons down at your feet
When everything already
Reminds me that I'm nothing without you

Yes, all of me
I give you all my dreams, my heart and my soul
When everything already
Reminds me that I don't exist without you

In this town where everything speaks about us
The memory of our dates are left
I hang up words full of hope
Waiting for the evening wind

I have nights that look like years
I've lost sleep by dreaming too much
I've shouted against walls
But nothing puts my mind at ease

All of me
I lay my time and my weapons down at your feet
When everything already
Reminds me that I'm nothing without you

And if the gods are against us
Then I would be a marabout
I would hunt cold winters
Like a queen of hearts defends her king
Oh whoa…
Oh oh…

All of me
I lay my time and my weapons down at your feet
When everything already
Remindѕ me thаt I'm nothing without you
