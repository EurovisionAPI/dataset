Love?

Love can build you up
Love can tear you down
Love can change the world
This is what I've found

Love can make you happy
Love can make you cry
Love can be the best
Until it's passed you by
(Love, love, love)

Do you wanna, do you wanna
Do you wanna fall in love?
Do you need it? Can you feel it?
Do you think you're strong enough?

Can you take the highs?
Can you take the lows?
Can you handle everything love throws?

Love can build you up
Love can tear you down
Love can change the world
This is what I've found

Love can make you happy
Love can make you cry
Love can be the best
Until it's passed you by
(Love, love, love)

If you want it, come and get it
Even though you know the score
I will love you, I will hate you
Then I'll love you even more

Can you handle love?
Can you handle pain?
Can you handle everything I'm sayin'?

Love can build you up
Love can tear you down
Love can change the world
This is what I've found

Love can make you happy
Love can make you cry
Love can be the best
Until it's passed you by
(Love, love, love)

Love will capture you whole
With your body and soul
Love is taking control of your senses

Love is guilty as tried
Love has no alibi
Love is breaking down all your defences
Love

Love can make you sorry
Love can make you weep
Love can take you over
Even when you sleep

Love can give you heaven
Love can make you high
Love can make you cheat
And love can make you lie

Love can build you up
Love can tear you down
Love can change the world
This is what I've found

Love can make you happy
Love can make you cry
Love can be the best
Until it's pаsѕed you by
