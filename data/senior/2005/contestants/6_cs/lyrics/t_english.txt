Forever mine

There, love, where the bells toll
You will forever be mine alone
There, where the river kisses the sea
Till dawn
Forever

High up there, behind that hill
Where my old house stands
I will be with you, my desire
Stay there

There, love, where the bells toll
You will forever be mine alone
There, where the river kisses the sea
Till dawn

High up there, behind that hill
Where my old house stands
I will be with you, my desire
Stay there

You've wounded my soul
Hypnotised me with beauty

There, love, where the bells toll
You will forever be mine alone
There, where the river kisses the sea
Till dawn

High up there, behind that hill
Where my old house stands
I will be with you, my deѕire
Stаy there
Forever
