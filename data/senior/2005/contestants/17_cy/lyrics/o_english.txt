Ela ela

(Ela, ela, ela, la…)

You're there, I'm here
No need to fear
Feel around me the desire
Search my body, reach the fire

Just cross the line
You have no time
My persistence is outrageous
You'll be mine 'cause I'm contagious

Come, baby, come, baby
Get the feeling
Come, baby, come, baby
Get the meaning
Ela, ela, ela, la
I'll make your heart go bang, bang

Come, baby, come, baby
Get the feeling
Come, baby, come, baby
Get the meaning
Ela, ela, ela, la
I'm the king of the night
Let me show you tonight who I am
Ela, ela, ela, la

(Ela, ela, ela, la…)

Mysterious, delirious
Let me be the key to passion
"Ela" is the word for action

Come, baby, come, baby
Get the feeling
Come, baby, come, baby
Get the meaning
Ela, ela, ela, la
I'll make your heart go bang, bang

Come, baby, come, baby
Get the feeling
Come, baby, come, baby
Get the meaning
Ela, ela, ela, la…
I'm the king of the night
Let me show you tonight who I am

(Ela)
(Come, baby, come, baby…)

Come, baby, come, baby
Get the feeling
Yeah, come, baby, come, baby
Get the meaning
Ela, ela, ela, la
I'll make your heart go bang, bang

Come, baby, come, baby
Get the feeling
Yeah, come, baby, come, baby
Ela, ela, ela, la
I'm the king of the night
Let me show you tonight who I am

Ela, ela, ela, la
I'm the king of the night
Let me ѕhow you tonight who I am
Come, baby, come, bаby
