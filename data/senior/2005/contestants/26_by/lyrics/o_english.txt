Love me tonight

I wish you could be near me
I seek your eyes to thrill me
So take your chance and feel me
I am ready now

(I dream of you by my side)
Move closer, baby
(You've got a place in my mind)
I'm with you, baby
(Do it to me one more time)
I'm waiting, baby
Give me the time of my life

Love me tonight
And I'll love you forever
It's no sin, it's no crime
That I want you mine

Love me tonight
I need you more than ever
You can make me feel right
Just love me tonight
Love me tonight

I've got no hesitation
It's my infatuation
Your touch is an obsession
I'm addicted now

(I dream of you by my side)
Move closer, baby
(You've got a place in my mind)
I'm with you, baby
(Do it to me one more time)
I'm waiting, baby
Give me the time of my life

Love me tonight
I need you more than ever
You can make me feel right
Just love me tonight

(Do it to me one more time)
(Give me the time of my life)
(Give me the time of my life)

Love me tonight
I need you more than ever
You can make me feel right
Just love me tonight
Love me tonight
Love me tonight

Love you forever
And we'll be together
So just ѕtаy with me for the night
Love me tonight
