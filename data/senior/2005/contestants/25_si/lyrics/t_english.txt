Stop

I rest on a dusty wall
With all might, I resist it
I knock and hope that you don't hear me
You open the door, as if you don't care

Why are we both pretending?
You've been marked by his kiss

Bind my hands so I can drown
In your embrace, because of lies, I bleed out
Tell me to stop when I look you in your eyes
At least tonight

Bind my hands so I can drown
In your embrace, because of lies, I bleed out
Tell me to stop when I look you in your eyes
Protect me at least tonight

For so long you've been hiding with kisses in your hands
With a heavy heart you doubt us
Brush me off like dust, destroy everything through your fingers
So I don't fall because of hope

Bind my hands so I can drown
In your embrace, because of lies, I bleed out
Tell me to stop when I look you in your eyes
Protect me at leaѕt tonight, protect me

Lalala laila…
Lalala laila lailа…
