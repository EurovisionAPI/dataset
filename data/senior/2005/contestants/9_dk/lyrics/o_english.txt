Talking To You

You nailed me to the floor with just one look
I'll sail any ocean
To show my devotion
If only I could open up your eyes
And get your attention
A brand new dimension

Connect your inner line
And tell me that you're mine
M-mh, yeah

I'm talking to you, through my heart
Talking to you girl, just tell me where to start
I wanna get through, right away
Wanna get through now, can't wait another day

You're all I hoped to find
I've never felt like this before
I got to make you mine

I wonder how it feels to be with you
Imagination
My sweet temptation
I just can't get enough
I'm desperate, desperate for your love

I'm talking to you, through my heart
Talking to you girl, just tell me where to start
I wanna get through, right away
Wanna get through now, can't wait another day

You're all I hoped to find
I've never felt like this before
I've got to make you mine

<i style="color:#789">I'm talking to, I'm talking to you</i>
I'm talking to you, baby
<i style="color:#789">I wanna get, I wanna get through</i>
I-i-i wanna get through

<i style="color:#789">I'm talking to you, through my heart</i>
Talking to you girl, just tell me where to start
<i style="color:#789">I wanna get through, right away</i>
Wanna get through
<i style="color:#789">Wanna get through now</i>
Can't wait another day

You're all I hoped to find
I've never felt like thiѕ before
I know you will be mine

I'm tаlking to you
