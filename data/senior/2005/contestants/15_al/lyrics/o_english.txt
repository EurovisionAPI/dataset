Tomorrow I Go

Please don't be sad, it's like you always dreamed
I wear the white veil
Oh mother, bless me please
Don't you cry
Tomorrow I go
The last night falling

Do you recall
How I would imagine a white wedding dress?
And now finally my time is here
I know that I will miss
Your sweet words singing

Maybe I'll cry
Still I hope you will sing, sing for me

Ti-ti-da… eh ti-ti-da…
Lift the drum beat, raise your voice
Ti-ti-da… eh ti-ti-da…
May the whole world shake as one
Let the song begin
Celebrate the dance within
Ti-ti-da-ti…

Maybe I'll cry
Still I hope you will sing, sing for me

Ti-ti-da… eh ti-ti-da…
Lift the drum beat, raise your voice
Ti-ti-da… eh ti-ti-da…
May the whole world shake as one
Let the song begin
Celebrate the dance within
Ti-ti-da…

Eh ti-ti-da… eh ti-ti-da…
Lift the drum beat, raise your voice
Ti-ti-da… eh ti-ti-da…
May the whole world shake as one
Let the song begin
Celebrate the dance within
Ti-ti-da-ti…

Oh…
Ti-ti-da… eh ti-ti-da…
Let the ѕong begin
Celebrate the dance within
Ti-ti-dа-ti…
