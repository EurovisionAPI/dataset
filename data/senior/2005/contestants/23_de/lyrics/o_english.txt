Run & hide

You'd better run and hide

Twenty five dollars wasted on you
Got you out of trouble, but you'll soon
Come by
For another try

You're a friend of mine and I know
Only crooked places you can go
Your eyes
Conveyed too many lies

You'd better run and hide
Too many girls have cried
Oh no, no, no, why
Do I feel sorry?

You'd better run and hide
Too many dreams have died
Oh no, no, no, why
Do I still worry?

You'd better run and
You'd better run and hide

Twenty five reasons to leave you
But I'm still feeling kinda blue
Inside
Watching our worlds collide

Baby, gotta see you as you are
Wipe the rest of yearning out of my heart
And try
To say that last goodbye
Yeah, yeah, yeah…

You'd better run and hide
Too many girls have cried
Oh no, no, no, why
Do I feel sorry?

You'd better run and hide
Too many dreams have died
Oh no, no, no, why
Do I still worry?
Yeah, yeah…
No, no, no, no
I ѕtill worry

You'd better run and hide
Hide
You'd better run and hide
You'd better run аnd hide
