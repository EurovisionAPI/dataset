D'you know the girl who came from Cuba? 
She loves our music and our songs 
She came and she saw 
Austrians dance quite slow 

Her shaking hips were inspiration 
To change the rhythm of our songs 
So now, here's the chance 
To see how she would dance 

Dance like a Latin girl
The pure rhythm of Alpine music
Dance like a Latin girl
The pure rhythm of Alpine music

Like that, like that
Like that dances the girl from the Caribbean
Like that, like that
Like that dances the girl from the Caribbean

The second part of our story: 
The girl from Cuba fell in love 
The boy she'd adore 
Could dance and sing and more 

He was the master of the yodel 
His (hodl-o-ii-dii...) was unique 
Oh, he was so smart 
She danced and won his heart 

Dance like a Latin girl
The pure rhythm of Alpine music
Dance like a Latin girl
The pure rhythm of Alpine music
(Hodl-o-ii-dii...)

Like that, like that
Like that sings the singer from the Alps
(Hodl-o-ii-dii...)
Like that, like that
Like that sings the singer from the Alps
(Hodl-o-ii-dii...)

Like that
Like that dances the girl from the Caribbean
Like that, like that
Like that sings the singer from the Alpѕ
(Hodl-o-ii-dii...)

Like that, like that
(Hodl-o-ii-dii...)
Like that, like that
(Hodl-o-ii-dii...)
Like that, like that
Like that, like thаt
(Hodl-o-ii-dii...)
