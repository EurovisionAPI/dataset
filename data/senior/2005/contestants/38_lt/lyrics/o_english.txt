Little By Little

Night shadows falling
I hear you calling
We're finally talking
Your words touch my soul

It's taken a long time
To get inside your mind
I know it's not easy
But baby, we're two of a kind

Ooh… little by little
I'm getting close to your heart
When we're together
Looks like we're making a start

Little by little
I see that look in your eyes
Each time you touch me
I want to reach out for you

No more confusion
It ain't no illusion
This is a fusion
Of body and mind

We're meant for each other
So baby, come on, hold me tight
We'll make it together
As we fly into the night

Ooh… little by little
I'm getting close to your heart
When we're together
Looks like we're making a start

Little by little
I see that look in your eyes
Each time you touch me
I want to reach out for you

Mmm… little by little

Little by little
I'm getting close to your heart
When we're together
Looks like we're making a start

Little by little
I see that look in your eyeѕ
Each time you touch me
I want to reаch out for you
