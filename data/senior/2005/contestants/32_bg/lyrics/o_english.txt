Lorraine

Standing here alone again
Waiting for the moment that we shared, my love
No matter how many lies you say
No matter how many miles you walk away from me
Lorraine

Here I am, all alone
Waiting for the moment again
But I know that you are gone

You got to know that harder the rain
Sweeter the pain
I can still remember Lorraine in the rain

Calling you again and again
I'll wait for your name
I can still remember Lorraine in the rain

Whispering your name again
Singing prayers among the stars
For you, my sweet Lorraine
You've always given me some great times
Try to imagine how we fly so far away from here
My Lorraine

Here I am, all alone
Waiting for the moment we shared
But I know that you are gone

You got to know that harder the rain
Sweeter the pain
I can still remember Lorraine in the rain

Calling you again and again
I'll wait for your name
I can still remember Lorraine in the rain

I can still remember Lorraine
I can still remember Lorraine in the rain

You got to know that harder the rain
Sweeter the pain (My sweet Lorraine)
I can still remember Lorraine in the rain
(Remember Lorraine in the rain)

Calling you again and again
(Again and again and again)
I'll wait for your name (My sweet Lorraine)
I can still remember Lorraine in the rain

(I will fly so far away from here, my love)
I can ѕtill remember Lorraine in the rаin
