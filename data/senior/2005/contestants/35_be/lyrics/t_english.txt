The big night

Tonight, all these looks
There in the dark, fear and hope
Tonight, it's not too late
To believe in dreams of glory
Tonight, a light
In a flash, to change history
Tonight, I prayed for it
I waited for it, the big night

Tonight, short of breath
With high commitment, not to disappoint
Tonight, to change sidewalk
Tonight, a new start
And to see his entire life
All his friends in a glance
Tonight, I make a wish
I want for them, the big night

Tonight, we all forget
The bad paths, the misty nights
Tonight, it's another day
Tonight, it's my turn at last
To have, as a Sunday
A revenge and the power
Tonight, to cаll it, to ѕing it
The big night, oh...
The big night
