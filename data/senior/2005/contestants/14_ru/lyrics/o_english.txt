Nobody Hurt No One

Hello sweet America
Where did our dream disappear?
Look at little Erica
All she learns today is the fear
You deny the truth
You just having fun
Till your child will shoot your gun

Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one, anybody
(Nobody hurt no one)
Nobody hurt no one, yeah, yeah…

She didn't wanna go to school
Didn't wanna face all this pain
Hoh… mummy, can I stay at home?
I am scared, the boys are insane
Don't you dare to say
Her reaction's dumb
'Cause she had no place to run

Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one, anybody
(Nobody hurt no one)
Nobody hurt no one, yeah-eah…

(Nobody hurt no one)
You deny the truth
You just having…
(Nobody hurt no one)
Till your child will shoot your gun
(Nobody hurt no one)
So please don't hurt anyone
(Nobody hurt no one)
