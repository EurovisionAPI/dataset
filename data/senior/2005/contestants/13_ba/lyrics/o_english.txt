Call Me

Call me

I used to think that we could never make it
That million hearts could never beat as one
But now, miracle is not so hard to find

There were times when I really doubted
If, after stormy weather, always comes the sun
But now, I can see the world from a different side, yeah

Singer after singer, remembered
Different flags, but nations gathered
From the north to the south, all standing side by side

There was laughter and there was crying
But after all, I'm not denying
I'm so happy to be here, 'cause it's the time of my life

Call me
Every time you're feeling lonely
Our greatest wish is one and only
Sing with me, it's how it should be
For the rest of our lives

So won't you call me?
We'll reach the very top and nothing less
United in the song, that's all it takes
Fifty candles on the party cakes
For the many years of happiness

There were times when I really doubted
If, after stormy weather, always comes the sun
But now, I can see the world from a different side, yeah

There was laughter, and there was crying
But after all, I'm not denying
I'm so happy to be here, 'cause it's the time of my life

Call me
Every time you're feeling lonely
Our greatest wish is one and only
Sing with me, it's how it should be
For the rest of our lives

So won't you call me?
We'll reach the very top and nothing less
United in the song, that's all it takes
Fifty candles on the party cakes
For the many years of happiness

There was laughter, and there was crying
But after all, I'm not denying
I'm so happy to be here, 'cause it's the time of my life
Call me

Call me
We'll reach the very top and nothing less
United in the song, that's all it takes
Fifty candles on the party cakes
For the many years of happiness

United in the song, that's all it takes
For the many years of happiness (of happinesѕ)
Cаll me
