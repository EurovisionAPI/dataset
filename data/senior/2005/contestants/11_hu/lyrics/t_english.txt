Spin, world

Spin, world
Carry me into the light
Or I won't live tomorrow
Your wild night kills me
Although it is waiting for me with a kiss

Don't hurt me, world
Don't hug, don't feel
Your love hurts more
Don't play, world
Let me go if a happy land calls

Haynana nanana… haynana nanana…
I want to be somewhere else for a long time
Haynana nanana… haynana nanana…
I don't see any light, I won't wait for it

Haynana nanana… haynana nanana…
I disappear in the sky or on the ground somewhere
Haynana nanana… haynana nanana…
That's how every sorrow can turn into a dream

Spin, world
I'm cold in the dark
You are at the end of all hope
Crazy world
You flame up, but turn into ice

Don't hurt me, world
I'm not walking on your path
Don't ask, don't call, don't see me
Don't regret it, world
All the other hearts are yours

Haynana nanana… haynana nanana…
I want to be somewhere else for a long time
Haynana nanana… haynana nanana…
I don't see any light, I won't wait for it

Haynana nanana… haynana nanana…
I disappear in the sky or on the ground somewhere
Haynana nanana… haynana nanana…
That's how every ѕorrow can turn into a dreаm
