Wolves die alone

Silence ties the dark like an anchor
The fear in me slowly melts away
This love was a vision
This is not my time

Only a few hours left till dawn
And outside unrest, as if a war is on
I put my coat on and leave
To forget everything

And once again boats sail down the Danube
Don't you worry about me anymore
I'm like leaves, the wind blows me away
Wolves die alone

And once again boats sail down the Danube
Don't you worry about me anymore
I'm like leaves, the wind blows me away
Wolves die alone

Silence ties the dark like an anchor
The fear in me slowly melts away
I put my coat on and leave
To forget everything

And once again boats sail down the Danube
Don't you worry about me anymore
I'm like leaves, the wind blows me away
Wolves die alone

(Down the Danube, down the Danube)
(Down the Danube, down the Danube)
(Down the Danube, down the Danube)
(Down the Danube)

And once again (boats sail down the Danube)
Don't you worry about me anymore
I'm like leaves, the wind blows me away
Wolves die alone

I'm like leaves, the wind blows me away
Wolveѕ die alone

(Down the Dаnube)
