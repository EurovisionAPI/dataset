To love

Sometimes the sky runs away
To look for another way
Where the sun doesn't fit in
And the moon doesn't want to stay

From sea to sea, hey
To see and conquer, hey
To love, to love
Always, always, anyway 
From sea to sea, hey
To see and conquer, hey
To love, to love
Always, day by day 

Only those who don't want to love
Look without seeing

Happy pretty way, happy shiny day 
Happy place to stay, we can hold it together 
Happy pretty way, happy shiny day 
Happy place to stay, we can hold it forever 

Pretty people shining, a pretty place to stay 
Brand new kind of face, I love you anyway 
Fight for the love that I miss, ask me to stay 

Happy pretty way, happy shiny day 
Happy place to stay, we can hold it together 
Happy pretty way, happy shiny day 
Happy place to stay, we can hold it forever 

Happy pretty way, very shiny day 
Happy place to stay, we can hold it together 
Happy pretty way, happy shiny day 
Happy place to stay, we can hold it forever 

From sea to sea
To see and conquer
To love, to love
Ask me to stay 
To love

(Happy pretty way, happy shiny day) 
(Happy place to stay, we can hold it together) 
(Happy pretty way, happy shiny day) 
(Happy place to stay, we can hold it forever) 

Pretty way, happy, happy shiny day 
A brand new day, happy, happy place to stay 
Pretty way, happy, happy shinny day 
A brand new day, happy, happy place to ѕtаy
