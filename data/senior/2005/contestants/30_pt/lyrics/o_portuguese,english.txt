Amar

O céu às vezes foge
Procura outro lugar
Onde o Sol não cabe
E a Lua não quer ficar

De mar em mar, hey
Ver e vencer, hey
Amar, amar
Sempre, sempre, anyway
De mar em mar, hey
Ver e vencer, hey
Amar, amar
Always, day by day

Só quem não quer amar
Olha sem ver

Happy pretty way, happy shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it together
Happy pretty way, happy shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it forever

Pretty people shining, a pretty place to stay
Brand new kind of face, I love you anyway
Fight for the love that I miss, ask me to stay

Happy pretty way, happy shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it together
Happy pretty way, happy shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it forever

Happy pretty way, very shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it together
Happy pretty way, happy shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it forever

De mar em mar
Ver e vencer
Amar, amar
Ask me to stay
Amar

(Happy pretty way, happy shiny day)
(Happy place to stay, we can hold it together)
(Happy pretty way, happy shiny day)
(Happy place to stay, we can hold it forever)

Pretty way, happy, happy shiny day
A brand new day, happy, happy place to stay
Pretty way, happy, happy shinny day
A brand new day, happy, happy place to ѕtаy
