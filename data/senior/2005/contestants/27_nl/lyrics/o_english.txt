My impossible dream

I have a dream…

You 'n' me, we're driftin' far apart
Our story has been told
Can't you see, the writing's on the wall?
I've come in from the cold
And I will follow my dream

I'll fight the big wide world
I'll make it on my own
Against all odds I'm breakin' free
The gauntlet has been thrown
My colours have been shown
Now I seek my impossible dream

Now's the time
To hold my head up high
Find my identity
So I will follow my dream

I'll fight the big wide world
I'll make it on my own
Against all odds I'm breakin' free
The gauntlet has been thrown
My colours have been shown
Now I seek my impossible dream

My dream…

I'll fight the big world
I'll make it on my own again
Against all odds I'm breakin' free
The gauntlet has been thrown
My colours have been shown
Now I seek my imposѕible dreаm
