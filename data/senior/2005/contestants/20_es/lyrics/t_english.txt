Witchcraft

In every corner of my home
In every thing that happens to me
I feel his presence looking at me

I look in every corner
I search in every drawer
Messing up everything until I find my soul

And I surrender to him
And I don't know what to do
Love dominates me

I don't want to go out
I don't want to eat
I don't want to live another adventure

I get hot with your body
I feed myself with your kisses
Because you are my only madness

And I don't know what to do
I believe
That it is witchcraft

There's no cure for my soul
I only desire your warm body
And you look like a burning fire
That penetrates me all, all
And I become the target of your witchcraft

There's no cure for my soul
You dominate me with only one look
And you don't need ropes to tie me up
I'm a beast that doesn't escape for love
Although you open the grills

(Le le ley le)
(Le le le ley le)
(Le le le ley le)
(Ley)

There aren't antidotes nor ointments
Neither cures from once upon a time
That can take this obsession out of my head

There's neither a fantastic owl
Nor wings of a muse
Even if they're cooked with melons and cherries

And I don't know what to do
I believe
That it is witchcraft

There's no cure for my soul
I only desire your warm body
And you look like a burning fire
That penetrates me all, all
And I become the target of your witchcraft

There's no cure for my soul
You dominate me with only one look
And you don't need ropes to tie me up
I'm a beast that doesn't escape for love
Although you open the grills

(Blend some happiness)
(With a little fantasy)
(And your lover will answer)

(I would like you to wrap me)
(With your bullfighter's cloak)
(And only this way I'd like)
(Your love, your love, your love)

Witchcraft
There's no cure for my soul
I only desire your warm body
And you look like a burning fire
That penentrates me all, all
And I become the target of your witchcraft

There's no cure for my soul
You dominate me with only one look
And you don't need ropes to tie me up
I'm a beast that doesn't escape for love
Although you open the grillѕ
