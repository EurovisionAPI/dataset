Let's get loud

I'm hot like indian spice, like boiling water
I'm in the mood, no-one can stop me tonight
So turn the power on, gimme the guitar
No time for misery – all right

When the bass is loud, drums sound like a thunder
I'm spinning round my records – that's right
Come on, let's raise the roof
Wake up the neighbours
Open the windows, scream and shout

We're not angels in the sky
Playing harp and flying high
Now we can rock the crowd
So let's get loud

Come on girls, sing along that song
Shake the house till the early morning
Boring yesterday is gone
So let's get loud

Come on girls, you can rock the crowd
Dance all night, turn on the party
We just wanna hear you shout
So let's get loud

(So let's get loud, yeah)

Turn off the TV-set
This soap is boring
Bold &amp; Beautiful ain't our theme tonight
So let us rule your heart
And be the leaders
Wake up you guys and feel alive

We're not angels in the sky
Playing harp and flying high
Now we can turn the crowd
So let's get loud

Come on girls, sing along that song
Shake the house till the early morning
Boring yesterday is gone
So let's get loud

Come on girls, you can rock the crowd
Dance all night, turn on the party
We just wanna hear you shout
So let's get loud

(Let's get loud, let's get loud)
(Let's get loud, let's get loud)

Come on girls, sing along that song
Shake the house till the early morning
Boring yesterday is gone
So let's get loud

Come on girls, you can rock the crowd
Dance all night, turn on the party
We just wanna hear you shout
So let's get loud

Come on girls, sing along that song
Shake the house till the early morning
Boring yesterday is gone
So let's get loud

Come on girls, you can rock the crowd
Dance all night, turn on the party
We just wanna heаr you shout
So let'ѕ get loud
