Why

In the night, there's a candle burning
Little light full of ache and yearning
For the child who won't be returning
And all the loved ones left behind

Morning breaks with the news of violence
Nothing moves in the haze of silence
Deep inside it feels like a riot
Oh, where can I find peace of mind?

(And they say that our trouble's just begun)
Tell me how
(Tell me how much we'll lose before we've won)
These tears won't dry

So I'm asking
Why? (Why?) Why?
Will we ever find the answer?
Why? (Why?) Why?
Why can't love be all that matters?
Why? (Why?) Why?
While we try to understand
Faith and hope are slipping through our hands
Can you tell me why?

What's the secret to make things better?
Where's the thread holding us together?
How do we find the key that lets us
Open up our hearts and minds?

Winds of faith blow us past our limits
Spend our lives searching for forgiveness
Can one voice really make a difference?
Still I know we've got to try

(And they say that our trouble's just begun)
Tell me how
(Tell me how much we'll lose before we've won)
These tears won't dry

So I'm asking
Why? (Why?) Why?
Will we ever find the answer?
Why? (Why?) Why?
Why can't love be all that matters?
Why? (Why?) Why?
While we try to understand
That faith and hope are slipping through our hands
(Tell me why)

Tears are falling down like rain
A flood of questions come
It is getting hard to wait
Is really love so hard to find?

So I'm asking
(Why?) Why…?
Will we ever find the answer?
Why? (Why?) Why? (Why?)
Why can't love be all that matters?
Why? (Why?) Why?
While we pray to understand
Faith and hope are slipping through our hаndѕ
Tell me why
