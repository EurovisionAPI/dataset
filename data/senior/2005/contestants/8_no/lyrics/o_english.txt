In my dreams

Come on, come on, come on
Love is all over me (Over me)

I don't know if this is what it seems
Is it real or just a fantasy?
Aim to please is all you ever do
Making all my fairytales come true

Come on, come on, come on
Love is all over me (Over me)
You are the only one
Livin' in my fantasy, in my dreams

Scared of waking up and you'll be gone
Face the truth and I'll be all alone
Baby, let's get into the groove
Show me all your dirty moves

Come on, come on, come on
Love is all over me (Over me)
You are the only one
Livin' in my fantasy, in my dreams

Come on, come on, come on
Love is all over me (Over me)
You are the only one
Livin' in my fantasy, in my dreams
In my dreams

If this ain't real, don't wake me up
I don't ever wanna stop
No, no

Come on, come on, come on
Love is all over me
You are the only one
Livin' in my fantasy, in my dreams

Come on, come on, come on
Love is all over me
You are the only one
Livin' in my fantasy, in my dreams

(Come on, come on, come on)
(Love is all over me) Ooh…
(You are the only one)
(Livin' in my fantasy)
In my dreаmѕ
