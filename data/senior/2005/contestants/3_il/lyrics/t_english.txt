The silence that remains

I was blind to the light of day
From all the logic there was no room left
Trembling beside you and the drug in me is not yet finished
I'm breathing you and the taste is already bitter

The glance is different and the cold is piercing
You're hiding, breaking my body
The glance is different and the cold is piercing
How another day goes by without a breath

Nighttime comes slowly, time stands still
Nighttime and you are the silence that remains
Falling with you for one moment at the end of the game
(And only the silence that remains)

With dozen lonely nights in my empty bed
Waiting for your touch, drying tears instead
I can't forget them
Promises you made had no faith
You never really kept them
And now it's goodbye

Oh, now that love is gone
Where do I belong?
Was it right or wrong?
Look at me now

Finally I know it's time to say goodbye
Suddenly all by myself I feel alive
I can't live the lie, no reason to cry
But now it's just time, ooh…
(It's time to say goodbye)

Finally tonight (I know) I feel alive
Can't live the lie, no reason to cry
But now it's just time, oh…
(And only the silence that remаinѕ)
