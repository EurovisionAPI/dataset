Hasheket shenish'ar

Hayiti ke'iveret le'or hayom
Merov hahigayon lo nish'ar makom
Ro'edet leyadcha vehasam shebi od lo nigmar
Noshemet li mimcha vehata'am kvar mar

Hamabat acher vehakor choder
Ata mistater, et gufi shover
Hamabat acher vehakor choder
Ech od yom over bli neshima

Laila ba le'at, hazman ne'etsar
Laila ve'ata hasheket shenish'ar
Rega echad nofelet itcha besof hamischak
(Verak hasheket shenish'ar)

With dozen lonely nights in my empty bed
Waiting for your touch, drying tears instead
I can't forget them
Promises you made had no faith
You never really kept them
And now it's goodbye

Oh, now that love is gone
Where do I belong?
Was it right or wrong?
Look at me now

Finally I know it's time to say goodbye
Suddenly all by myself I feel alive
I can't live the lie, no reason to cry
But now it's just time, ooh…
(It's time to say goodbye)

Finally tonight (I know) I feel alive
Can't live the lie, no reason to cry
But now it's just time, oh…
(Verak hasheket sheniѕh'аr)
