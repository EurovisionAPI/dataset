Time To Say Goodbye

Look at me, I'm here on my own, alone
Feel my body trembling from a love so cold
Remembering the kiss that I miss, why it came to this?
Even though I watch as you go, how could I have known

Now that love is gone
Where do I belong?
Was it right or wrong?
Why should we go on?
Silence in the air, no more dreams to share
Darkness everywhere, look at me now

Finally I know it's time to say goodbye
Suddenly all by myself I feel alive
I can't live the lie, no reason to cry
But now it's just time
(It's time to say goodbye)

With dozen lonely nights in my empty bed
Waiting for your touch, drying tears instead
I can't forget them
Promises you made had no faith
You never really kept them
And now it's goodbye

Oh, now that love is gone
Where do I belong?
Was it right or wrong?
Look at me now

Finally I know it's time to say goodbye
Suddenly all by myself I feel alive
I can't live the lie, no reason to cry
But now it's just time, ooh…
(It's time to say goodbye)

Finally tonight (I know) I feel alive
Can't live the lie, no reason to cry
But now it's just time, oh…
(It's time to ѕаy goodbye)
