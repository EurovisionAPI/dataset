Rimi rimi ley li, ley li limi ley, hey…

Yamah-ah…
My love was addicted to your love
I was addicted and perplexed
Ley limi ley, rimi rimi ley
This is not love, but like a punishment for me
Ley limi ley, rimi rimi ley
This is not love, but like a melancholy

Did the love tire you, demon?
My heart loved you so much
My insanity is miserable
Come back, cutie

You're my heart, my everything
Who sets me on fire, upsets me and makes me smile
You're the one who ruins me in the end
Destiny, you're cruel

Lah-ah…
My love was addicted to your love
I was addicted and perplexed
Ley limi ley, rimi rimi ley
This is not love, but like a melancholy

Did the love tire you, demon?
My heart loved you so much
My insanity is miserable
Come back, cutie

You're my heart, my everything
Who sets me on fire, upsets me and makes me smile
You're the one who ruins me in the end
Destiny, you're cruel

Did the love tire you, demon?
My heart loved you so much
My insanity is miserable
Come back, cutie

You're my heart, my everything
Who sets me on fire, upsets me and mаkes me smile
You're the one who ruins me in the end
Deѕtiny, you're cruel
