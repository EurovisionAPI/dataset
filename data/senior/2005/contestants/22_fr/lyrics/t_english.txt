Everyone thinks of himself

Everyone thinks of himself
As if there's nothing but that
Everyone accomplishes
What he wants

Everyone thinks of himself
As if there's nothing but that
Everyone accomplishes
What he wants

Let's look around us
We live in a world of fools
Everyone looks for glory
Everyone looks for hope

We forget what surrounds us
Those who give us love
We hunt away from our memory
What we don't want to believe

We leave behind on the side of the road
Our sorrows with no day after
We each follow our path

We each leave behind on the side of the path
All our little doubts
We follow our road

Everyone thinks of himself
As if there's nothing but that
Everyone accomplishes
What he wants

Everyone thinks of himself
As if there's nothing but that
Everyone accomplishes
What he wants

We hold in the palm of our hands
The keys to our destiny
To lead to victory
All our dreams of one night

And we run behind the time
We pass beside people
We run for money
We hide ourselves, we lie

Even if the solitude
Is our only attitude
We hold within each of us

The love of those who love us
Even if we are in pain
We will find each other

Even if the reality
Is not our truth
We keep believing in it
In this fighting for our history

Even if the price to pay
Is higher with each time
We keep believing in it
Hopes for our hopes

Everyone thinks of himself
As if there's nothing but that
Everyone accomplishes
What he wants

Everyone thinks of himself
As if there's nothing but that
Everyone accomplishes
What he wants

Everyone thinks of himself

As if there's nothing but that
(Is not our truth)
Everyone accomplishes
(We keep believing in it)
What he wants
(In this fighting for our history)

Everyone thinks of himself
(Even if the price to pay)
As if there's nothing but that
(Is higher with each time)
Everyone accomplishes

(Hopes for our hopes)

Everyone thinks of himself
(Even if the reality)
As if there's nothing but that

As if there's nothing but that
