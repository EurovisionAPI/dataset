Make My Day

Ley lala ley la… lala ley lala ley la…
Lala ley lala ley la… lala ley lalala…
Ley lala ley la… lala ley lala ley la…
Lala ley lala ley la… lala ley lalala…

Day after day, time after time
You just try to make me cry
Hand in your hand, tears in my eyes
I pretend you make me fly

But honestly, it's plain to see
I'm not the man to be
Your cuddly toy, I am the boy
Who will break up with you to be free

Make my day, get away
Take it all, baby, please go
Try to play another way
Or I will find another love

Ley lala ley la… lala ley lala ley la…
Lala ley lala ley la… lala ley lalala…

Day after day, time after time
You just try to make me cry
But don't you see that I am the boy
Who will break up with you to be free?

Make my day, get away
Take it all, baby, please go
Try to play another way
Or I will find another love
(Make my day) Shake it now, baby

Make my day, get away
Take it all, baby, please go
Try to play another way
Or I will find another love

Make my day, get away
Take it all, baby, pleaѕe go
Try to play another way
Or I will find another love

Make my dаy
