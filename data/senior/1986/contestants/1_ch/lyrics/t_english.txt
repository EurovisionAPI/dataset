Not for me

Not for me, all those adventures
Not for me, easy come and easy go
Not for me
Those tricks after evenings at the disco
Not for me
I can't stand advances anywhere
Be it at the opera or in the underground

I want a love written in capitals
I want a story that lasts a lifetime
I won't unfold my wings
For a one night stand
No that's not it
I want love, love the way it used to be
Tender feelings, that's what I want from you

Not for me, all those extravagances
The parties, certain holidays
The follies that one regrets later in life

Not for me
I don't trust those with experience
No thanks, all that was not really made for me

I want a love written in capitals
I want a story that lasts a lifetime
I won't unfold my wings
For a one night stand
No, that's not it
I want love, love the way it used to be
Tender feelings, that's what I want from you

I want love, love the way it used to be
Tender feelings, that's what I want from you
And why iѕn't it thаt?
