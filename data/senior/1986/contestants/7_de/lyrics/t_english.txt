Crossing the bridge

Enough words, come on, we go into the light
There we will be seen, no, I'm not afraid
Because your hand gives me a feeling of trust
Let's begin to build a bridge, whoa….

Crossing the bridge, understanding other people
Other songs, other countries in the world
Crossing the bridge, looking behind the wall
Good thoughts melt the ice in the hearts of our world

We are only guests for a little time
On this star filled with light and darkness
What becomes of it also depends on you and me
Open your heart and then the door will open, whoa…

Crossing the bridge, understanding other people
Other songs, other countries in the world
Crossing the bridge, looking behind the wall
Good thoughts melt the ice in the hearts of our world

Crossing the bridge, to see the brighter sun
The brighter morning, the brighter shine of our star
Crossing the bridge, to see love grow brighter
Good thoughts melt the ice in the heаrtѕ of our world

Our unique world
