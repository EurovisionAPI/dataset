Now I live

A blue sky
And golden sand is in my heart
And in my dreams
Everything becomes a dance

A far away exotic island
You have, as a hidden flower
In every one of your songs
A purpose full of rhythm and melody

Now, now I live, only now I live
I live what I was living in my dreams
Now, now I live, only now I live
Now I live and have you in my heart

A thousand birds sing
The world becomes a feast
Look at the stars now
They become hot kisses

The moon plays hide and seek
And dances on the seawave
Everything goes right
Like a sweet smile

Now, now I live, only now I live
I live what I was living in my dreams
Now, now I live, only now I live
Now I live and have you in my heart

All, all, all for dance
Music, song and rhythm
Nana nanana…
All, all, all for dance
Music, song and rhythm
Nana nanana…

Now, now I live, only now I live
I live what I was living in my dreams
Now, now I live, only now I live
Now I live and have you in my heart

Now, now I live, only now I live
I live what I was living in my dreamѕ
Now, now I live, only, only now
Now I live and have you in my heаrt
