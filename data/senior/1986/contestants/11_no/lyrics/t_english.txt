Romeo

I still remember when I asked you out
I was shivering inside
But I was torn between belief and doubt
You made me swallow all of my pride

I bought you flowers and dressed like a prince
Just to show you that I was sincere
But when I thought, this is where it begins
You whispered goodbye in my ear

Romeo, Romeo, heavens knows you never get to be another
Romeo, Romeo, time to wrangle in Rome

I tried to hard to make you change your mind
You needed time to be assured
Must keep myself from going across the line
That's one mistake I can't afford

I've played the part of a fool and a clown
I couldn't see you were turning me down
But every time I got up to ask why
You would give me a familiar reply

Romeo, Romeo, heavens knows you never get to be another
Romeo, Romeo, time to wrangle in Rome

Romeo, Romeo, heavens knows you never get to be another
Romeo, Romeo, time to wrangle in Rome

Got on my knees and told you from the heart
"Take me or tear me apart"

Romeo, Romeo, heavens knows you never get to be another
Romeo, Romeo, time to wrangle in Rome

Romeo, Romeo, heavens knowѕ you never get to be another
Romeo, Romeo, time to wrаngle in Rome

Romeo
