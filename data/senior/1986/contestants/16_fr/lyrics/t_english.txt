European girls

We feel like going away
When there's no more sunshine in the house
We want to take off
A few hours in a plane to change everything

Amsterdam, Copenhagen or Capri
It's super to do a thousand foolish things

We're European girls
And the things we love
We find them here, from London to Paris
Even if the music is connected
Live from Radio L.A.

European girls, and when we love someone
It's the French love, a bit liberated
We like the old continent
With background music USA

We all have in our hearts
A song about Indian summer
Colour posters
Of African sunsets

We prefer the smile of Italy
England, Boy George and Lady Di

We're European girls
And the things we love
We find them here, from London to Paris
Even if the music is connected
Live from Radio L.A.

European girls, and when we love someone
It's the French love, a bit liberated
We like the old continent
With background music USA
Hey...

We're all European girls
And the things we love
We find them here, from London to Paris
The weather is nice in California
But Saint-Tropez is also good
