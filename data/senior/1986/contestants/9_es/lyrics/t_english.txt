Valentino

In Madrid, in a hotel
It happened, I played my role
She and I, the passion
Coincided at the reception

Valentino couldn't have done it better
Red roses with an invitation
A tango in the lounge
Champagne and seduction
And the orchestra will play for the two of us
The passion will take us to your room

Valentino, Valentino

Attraction, emotion
She will fall under my control

Valentino, dance a tango for me
I want to be the hero in your films
Valentino couldn't have done it better
Red roses with an invitation
Lying on the chaise longue, waiting for my love
Ah, if Hollywood knew who I am
Everybody would dance to my ѕong

Valentino, Valentino, Vаlentino
