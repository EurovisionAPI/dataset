Everything has rhythm

Seven o' clock, you have to get out of your bed
Your mother is shouting from the corridor:
"Come on girl, how long is it going to take?"

Listen up, I'm only just dreaming
A quarter past seven, I still have all the time
Because getting up doesn't take an eternity

It always goes this way
You always try it again and again
In your own way, every time a little harder

Take the time for everything
Live your own rhythm
You can make everything swing
In your own rhythm

Rhythm is in all people
And you can learn how to swing
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything has a rhythm

The whole day you've been running again
Quarter past six, you're not in time once again
Now, who whines about a futility like that?

Oh, in time, I just can't get used to it
Listen up, does it matter?
Because I'm going my own way anyway

It always goes this way
You always try it again
In your own way, every time a little harder

Take the time for everything
Live your own rhythm
You can make everything swing
In your own rhythm

Rhythm is in all people
And you can learn how to swing
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything has a rhythm

Take the time for everything
Live your own rhythm
You can make everything swing
In your own rhythm

Rhythm is in all people
And you can learn how to swing
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything has a rhythm
Everything has a rhythm
Everything has a rhythm
Everything haѕ а rhythm
