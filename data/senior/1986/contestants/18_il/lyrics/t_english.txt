A day will come

I want to live
With the feeling that it will come
Out of the faith that it will materialise
Out of the love that has no name

I want to live
With the feeling that it will come
Out of the faith that it will materialise
Out of the love that has no name

Everybody wants to live
With the feeling that it will come
Out of that prayer that has a name
That has a name

A day will come, will come upon us
A day will come, all of our children
When the day comes
Will sing a song to the world
That it will come

A day will come, will come upon us
A day will come, all of our children
When the day comes
Will sing a song to the world
That it will come

I want to live
With the feeling that it will come
Out of the faith that's in the heart
Out of a little prayer that it will be considerate

I want to live
With the feeling that it will come
With all the faith that's in the heart
Out of a little prayer that it will be considerate

Everybody wants to live
With the feeling that it will come
Out of the prophecy of the sheep that loves the wolf

A day will come, will come upon us
A day will come, all of our children
When the day comes
Will sing a song to the world
That it will come
It will come

A day will come, will come upon us
A day will come, all of our children
When the day comes
Will sing a song to the world
That it will come

A day will come upon us
A day will come, all of our children
When the day comes
Will sing a ѕong to the world
Thаt it will come
It will come
