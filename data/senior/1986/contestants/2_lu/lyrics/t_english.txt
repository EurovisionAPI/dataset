The love of my life

I've got so much love in me for no reason
My heart beats so much for no reason
How I'd like to leave one day for love

Towards the man who'll tell me for no reason
Things that aren't said for no reason
Words more beautiful than children
Stronger, bigger and higher than volcanoes

I'll fly without wings for the love of my life
I'll make suns to turn days into nights
I'll change time to keep longer
The love of my life

I dream of a smile for no reason
Of a rose he'll give me for no reason
And of a look coloured with hope
Just like in the night, the shining stars in the dark

I'll fly without wings for the love of my life
I'll make suns to turn days into nights
I'll change time to keep longer
The love of my life

I'll fly without wings for the love of my life
I'll make suns to turn days into nights
I'll change time to keep longer
The love of my life

I'll fly without wings for the love of my life
I'll make suns to turn days into nightѕ
I'll chаnge time to keep longer
The love of my life
