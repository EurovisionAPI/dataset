Is this what you call love?

I cannot live normally anymore
Each day is different from the other
And I've been trying to ignore you totally
Even though I know you are unique

Emotions always burning are torment to me
And yet I still want you for me
Even though I suffer a longing for you
I ask and demand an answer

Is this what you call love? (This what you call love?)
I don't want to have any more
Is this what you call feelings? (This what you call feelings?)
There's no point to it

Everything you do is concentrated on me
You've become an obsession
It's easy for me to be fascinated by you
You are loves irresistible force

Emotions always burning are torment to me
Yet I still want you for me
Even though I feel, I'm longing for you
I ask and demand an answer

Is this what you call love? (This what you call love?)
I don't want to have any more
Is this what you call feelings? (This what you call feelings?)
There's no point to it

And every time you smile, something happens
I plead and I pray, but no wonder happens

Is this what you call love? (This what you call love?)
I don't want to have any more
Is this what you call feelings? (This what you call feelings?)
There's no point to it

Is this what you call love? (This what you call love?)
I don't want to have any more
Is this what you wаnt?
There'ѕ no point to it
