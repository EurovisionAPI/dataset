You're full of lies

Look, just like before
You stand there making eyes,
Ooh… so confidently, to me
Standing there looking
As if it's a game you're playing
I say it honestly now, do you know what you are?

You're full of lies
When you say we're just friends
I go along with the joke for a little longer
And before 24 hours have passed
I think your lies will come to an end
For you strike sparks when you touch me

You play up
And entertain your friends
That will stop the first time
When you see, it's the two of us
And you finally admit
That everything I say is true

You're full of lies
When you say we're just friends
I go along with the joke for a little longer
And before 24 hours have passed
I think your lies will come to an end
For you strike sparks when you touch me

Just polish your halo
Do a cool style
Tell a new story, you can do whatever you want

For I can see that… (I can see that…)
You're full of lies
Clear as an open book
So give me four days, just with you

You're full of lies
When you say we're just friends
I go along with the joke for a little longer
And before 24 hours have passed
I think your lies will come to an end
It's so simple, you're hot like me
For you strike spаrks when I touch you
It's so ѕimple, you're hot for me
