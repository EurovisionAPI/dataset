I love life

I see people bowing their back
As if life was a zero
I'm fifteen and I tell you
Whoa whoa… I love life
(I love life – life, the whole life)

You have to believe in it, I also have
Flashes of hope, of insomnia
But in total, on the bill
I love the horizon

I love, I love life
(Even if it's madness)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
I love, I love life
Don't hold it against me
I was born that way
I love, I love life

Whoa… and no matter
If it rains a bit much on me
Whoa whoa… you're there

Compared to Jacques Brel, to Mozart
I feel so small, I've got the blues
I'm just a speck of dust
In this universe
(That's life – life, the whole life)

But as soon as you love me, as soon as you smile
My joy goes on forever
There's no more Brel, no more Mozart
My life begins again

I love, I love life
(Even if it's madness)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
I love, I love life
Don't hold it against me
I was born that way
I love, I love life

No matter if it rains a bit on me

I love, I love life
(Even if it's madness)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
I love, I love life
Don't hold it against me
I was born that way

I love, I love life
(Even if it's madness)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
For those days when things don't work out
I have something to fall back on
I'm counting on you
I love, I love life

Whoa… and no matter
If it rains a bit much on me
Whoa whoa… life – yeѕ, you аre there
