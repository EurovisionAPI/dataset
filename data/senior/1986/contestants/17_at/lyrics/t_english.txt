Time is lonely

Time is lonely and it is tired
It is tired of looking for you and stands still
Time is lonely and looks for us both
I alone cannot make it start again

For as long as you are not here
Time is so quiet
I am so like it
Time is lonely

I was always with you there
Time didn't know anything else
Always beaming eyes
It asks: Where is this light?

It asks: Where is the person
I used to be when I was with you?
It says, that I am alien to it
Why do I come alone to it

Time is lonely and it is tired
It is tired of looking for you and stands still

For as long as you're not here
It will not pass
I аm so like it
Time iѕ lonely
