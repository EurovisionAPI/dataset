You Can Count On Me

I was so happy with you
My hopes and dreams had all come true
And our love shone for all the world to see

As if you turned out the light
Your love was gone overnight
And all I've left – the words you said to me

You can count on me
You can count on me
Till the end of time, plus eternity

You can count on me
You can count on me
I'll be by your side, you can count on me

I see despair all around
All of the world is upside down
And there's no light ahead that I can see

If we could only be friends
Give it a chance and try again
Maybe we can relive the words you said to me

You can count on me
You can count on me
Till the end of time, plus eternity

You can count on me
(On me, don't you know?)
You can count on me
I'll be by your side, you can count on me

(You can count on)
(You can count on)
(Don't you know you can count on me?)
I'll be by your side, you can count on me

You can count on me
(On me, don't you know?)
You can count on me
Count on me till the end of time, plus eternity

You can count on me
(On me, don't you know?)
You can count on me
Count on me, I'll be by your side, by your ѕide
You cаn count on me
