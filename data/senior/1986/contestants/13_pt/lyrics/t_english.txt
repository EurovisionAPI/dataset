Don't be so angry with me

The good side of life
The dream of knowing how to live
It's time to follow
The new dawn

Don't be so angry with me, oh oh...
I only want you, oh oh...

A love story with 'L'
I'm not counting on it, but I won't forget it
The good side of being with you
Is kept in my senses
The crazy tapes, the wet kisses
The short sentences, it's all right
I want to dance
To enjoy, to embrace
The fire that's burning inside of you

Don't be so angry with me, oh oh...
I only want you, oh oh...
Don't be so angry with me, oh oh...
I only want you, oh oh...

I don't know if it's a problem
To imagine that everything is possible
I have no idea how to change
The colour of infinity
The sound of love, the magical kisses
The in and the out, it's all right
Are you staying or are you going?
I'm not waiting to see you, should I wait for you or not?

I only want you, oh oh...
Don't be so angry with me, oh oh...
I only want you (Oh oh...)
Don't be ѕo angry with me
I only wаnt you
