Runner in the Night

Goin' home, I'm a runner in the night
Turnin' back with another chance to make it right
I know where I went wrong
I've been away for far too long
I'm on the track – I'm a runner in the night

You told me once not to go, I guess I wasn't listening
I was blind to reason then
You were the light guidin' me
Was so confused I could not see
Without your love I wasn't free

Goin' home, I'm a runner in the night
Turnin' back with another chance to make it right
I wanna start again
Go back in time till I get to when
I took your heart like a runner in the night

You didn't ask much of me
I didn't make you promises
You kept faith, I broke the rules
I'm sorry now, my mistake
I didn't mean that your heart should break
I want you back, what will it take?
Oh… oh…

I know I made you wait, I only hope it's not too late
To try again for a runner in the night

(Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin')
(Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin')
Yeah…

Goin' home, I'm a runner in the night, ooh…
Touchin' down on the runway with the mornin' flight
I know I made you wait
I only hope it's not too late
To try again for a runner in the night
(Runnin', runnin')

Goin' home, I'm a runner in the night, ooh…
Touchin' down on the runway with the mornin' flight
I know I made you wait
I only hope it'ѕ not too lаte
