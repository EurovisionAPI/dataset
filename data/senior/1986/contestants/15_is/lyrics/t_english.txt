The Bank of Joy

Time flies by in the age of satellites
Faster every day, faster every night
Are you sometimes pondering over the bounced cheques
Perhaps you're withdrawing too much from the Bank of Joy

Cheer up and tie up all loose ends
Never deposit, only withdraw
The sins that you never committed lie dormant
An uncashed cheque from the Bank of Joy

You should sing a little song
About the joy in life that's in your heart
And let the world know that you have a house of joy
A cosy little song that can grab you at any time
You don't deposit your empty blues in the Bank of Joy

You should sing a little song
About the joy in life that's in your heart
And let the world know that you have a house of joy
A cosy little song that can grab you at any time
You don't deposit your empty blues in the Bank of Joy

Cheer up and tie up all loose ends
Never deposit, only withdraw
The sins that you never committed lie dormant
An uncashed cheque from the Bank of Joy

You should sing a little song
About the joy in life that's in your heart
And let the world know that you have a house of joy
A cosy little song that can grab you at any time
You don't deposit your empty blueѕ in the Bаnk of Joy
