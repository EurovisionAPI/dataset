My desire

I loved you and still do
I give it all truly
This night is dark without you

If there's luck, you'll come back
My punishment, my sin
Quiet, quiet, my tear, don't give up

My desire, my sorrow
I'm still yours, you're still mine
Everything is aching because of you
My desire, my sorrow

If there's luck, you'll come back
My punishment, my sin
Quiet, quiet, my tear, don't give up

My desire, my sorrow
I'm still yours, you're still mine
Everything is aching because of you
My desire, my sorrow

Everything is aching becаuse of you
My desire, my ѕorrow
