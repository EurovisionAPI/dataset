Day of two people

Over the mountains
Beyond the seas
My mind banishes the past
A little boy is a grown person
After he can create a new beginning

I can't sleep
Till the next morning
I'm awake
And wondering why I can't find
I don't want a bigger world
Just one day
One tomorrow
I will never say the end

The city lights
The echo of music
They stay in the foggy web
I have lost so much
I'm still looking for you
Like a world that has disappeared

I can't sleep
Till the next morning
I'm awake
And wondering why I can't find
I don't want a bigger world
Just one day
One tomorrow
I will never say the end

I can't sleep
Till the next morning
I'm awake
And wondering why I can't find
I don't want a bigger world
Just one day
One tomorrow
I will never ѕаy the end
