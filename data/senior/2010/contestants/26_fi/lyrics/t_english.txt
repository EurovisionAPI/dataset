One lives by working too

What do I sing when I'm happy?
What do I put on top of floating melodies?
Lots of sunshine and white clouds
Laughing eyes for market vendors

I sing: shine, sun, walk your route, dear moon
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading
I sing: shine, sun, walk your route, dear moon
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading

What do I sing when I'm unhappy?
What do my melodies need to carry then?
Rain and stormy weather over the city
A penny coin for the troubadour with holes in his pants

I sing: shine, sun, walk your route, dear moon
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading
I sing: shine, sun, walk your route, dear moon
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading

What do I sing when I'm in love?
Will my love carry the song to the moon?
Just some velvet, silk and golden threads
From those is sewn a shirt for my dearest

I sing: shine, sun, walk your route, dear moon
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading
I sing: shine, sun, walk your route, dear moon
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading

What do I sing when I'm walking alone?
Wondering why I keep on writing new songs
Two strange birds already fly behind the horizon
When it's time to finish the song

I sing: shine, sun, walk your route, dear moon
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading
I sing: shine, sun, walk your route, dear moon
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading

I sing: shine, sun, walk your route, dear moon
One lives by working too, but getѕ rich by trаding
