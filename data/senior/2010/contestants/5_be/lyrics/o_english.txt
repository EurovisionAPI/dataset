Me And My Guitar

People always say:
"Tom, this has gone too far"
But I'm not afraid to chase my dreams
Just me and my guitar

And no one may ever know
The feelings inside my mind
'Cause all of the lines I ever write
Are running out of time

So maybe I should get a nine to five
But I don't wanna let it go
There's so much more to life

Tell me that I got it wrong
Tell me everything will be okay
Before I fall
And tell me they'll play my songs
Tell me they'll sing the words I'll say
When darkness falls
Then all of the stars will see
Just me and my guitar
Mmm…

I'm sure that I'll find my way
'Cause I'm not afraid to try
But even a world of love and hope
Can't guarantee that price

So maybe I can get a nine to five
But I don't wanna let it go
There's so much more to life

No… tell me that I got it wrong
Tell me everything will be okay
And before I fall
No, no… tell me they'll play my songs
And tell me they'll sing the words I say
When darkness falls
Then all of the stars will see
Juѕt me and my guitar, oh oh…

Me and my guitаr, mmm… mmm…
