There are such days

There are such days
That leave us alone
The soul empty
The hurt in our voice

We wore away our hands
We hold them tight so much
There are no words anymore
Because we kept quiet so much

There is a song
Which I have not sung to you
Verses that are still to rhyme
Poems that I have never invented

Who set us this way?
The life torn
Who took you from me?
Stole my soul
But does not know a thing about you

There are such days
There is no need to hide
Fear words
To love or to suffer

To hide senses
To pretend they do not exist
There are lost days
Here and there

There is a song
Which I have not sung to you
Verses that are still to rhyme
Poems that I have never invented

Who set us this way?
The life torn
Who took you from me?
Stole my soul
But does not know a thing about you

I know one day you will know
That life is only one
It does not turn back

Who set us this way?
The life torn
Who took you from me?
Stole my soul
But doeѕ not know a thing аbout you
