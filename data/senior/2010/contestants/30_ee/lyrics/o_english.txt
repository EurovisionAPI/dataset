Siren

Siren in my head, is making an awful sound
It's time to make it clear
What is lost and what is found?

My life has been oh lame
Has been oh lame so far
I wasted years, I wasted time
Trying to reach the stars
My life has been oh lame
Has been oh lame so far

So, give me time and give me strength
Give me strength to carry on
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night
So, give me time and give me strength
Give me strength to carry on
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night

Siren in my head, yes, I can hear it again
Is it just the beginning, or is it the end?

My life has been oh lame
Has been oh lame so far
I wasted years, I wasted time
Trying to reach the stars
My life has been oh lame
Has been oh lame so far

So, give me time and give me strength
Give me strength to carry on
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night
So, give me time and give me strength
Give me strength to carry on
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night

So, give me time and give me strength
Give me strength to carry on
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night
So, give me time and give me strength
Give me ѕtrength to cаrry on
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night
