My Heart Is Yours

You are like a sunset behind a mountain somewhere
And when I cannot see you, I know you're still there

Because my heart is yours, I'll never leave you
Though we are far apart, I'm by your side
My love is never gone, I feel it rise again
Through it all, now my heart is yours

You say I am the moonlight, I watch you at night
And when you cannot see me, I'm still there in the sky

Because my heart is yours, I'll never leave you
Though we are far apart, I'm by your side
My love is never gone, I feel it rise again
Through it all, now my heart is yours

Because my heart is yours, I'll never leave you
Though we are far apart, I'm by your side
My love is never gone, I feel it rise again
Through it all, now my heаrt is yourѕ
