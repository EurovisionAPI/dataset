This is Balkan

Hey… Ljubica, Ljubica
Ljubica, you're making my mouth water
Hey… squeeze me, kiss me
Ljubica, press me against your chest

You're kissing me like a girl, you have no shame
Belgrade, Belgrade, I'm cheeky
Not once, not twice, three times for me
Belgrade, Belgrade, three times, it's our way

Balkan, Balkan, Balkan, this is Balkan, come on
Hop, hop, hop, this is Balkan, come on
Hop, hop, hop, this is Balkan, come on
Hop, hop, hop, this is Balkan, come on
Hop, hop, hop, this is Balkan, come on

Hey… Ljubica, Ljubica
Your breasts are a deadly weapon, Ljubica

You're kissing me like a girl, you have no shame
Belgrade, Belgrade, I'm cheeky
Not once, not twice, three times for me
Belgrade, Belgrade, three times, it's our way

Balkan, Balkan, Balkan, this is Balkan, come on!
Hop, hop, hop, this is Balkan, come on
Hop, hop, hop, this is Balkan, come on
Hop, hop, hop, this is Balkan, come on
Hop, hop, hop, this is Balkan, come on

Just a bit, just a bit, just a bit, just a bit
Just a bit, just a bit, just a bit, just a bit
Just a bit, just a bit, give it to him

You're kissing me like a girl, you have no shame
Belgrade, Belgrade, I'm cheeky
Not once, not twice, three times for me
Belgrade, Belgrade, three times, it'ѕ our wаy
