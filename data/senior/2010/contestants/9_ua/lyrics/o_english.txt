Sweet People

Oh, sweet people
What have we done?
Tell me what is happening?
For all that we've built
Tumbles and is gone

Oh, sweet people
Have you no love for mankind?
Must you go on killing
Just to pass the time?

The message is so true
The end is really near
All these feelings take me down
It steals the things so dear

Yes, the message is so real
Don't turn all the earth to stone
Because, because, because
This is your home

Oh, sweet people
What about our children?
In theatres and video games
They watch what we send to ruin

Oh, sweet people
What senseless game
Have we all been playing?
No one but you to blame?

The message is so true
The end is really near
All these feelings take me down
It steals the things so dear

Yes, the message is so real
Don't turn all the earth to stone
Because, because, becаuse
This is your home

This iѕ our home
