Eastern European Funk

You've seen it all before, we ain't got no taste, we're all a bore
You should give us a chance, 'cause we're all victims of circumstance
We've had it pretty tough, but that's okay, we like it rough
We'll settle the score, survived the reds and two world wars

Yes sir, we are legal, we are, though we're not as legal as you
No sir, we're not equal, no, though we're both from the EU
We build your homes, we wash your dishes, keep your hands all squeaky clean
Some day you'll come to realise Eastern Europe is in your genes
