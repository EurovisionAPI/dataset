You're an angel

Ho… oh…
Ho… oh…

We were kids, some have grown up
The others haven't, they remained angels
The key is in you, the doors are closed
Behind them, an angel with wings lives

You're an angel, don't you believe?
An angel predicted your way
You're an angel, have you forgotten?
Your love proves it

Oh… oh…
Oh… oh…
Oh oh… oh…
Oh oh… oh…

You're an angel born to be free
But I've got you and you've got me
When the lights go down, you bring me salvation
When the tears run dry, you appear
To save and love and comfort me
Till the end of time you will always be my angel

My love, my love
You're an angel, my love

Oh… oh…
Ho… oh…
Oh… oh…
Oh oh… oh…

You're an angel, don't you believe?
An angel predicted your way
You're an angel, hаve you forgotten?
Your love proveѕ it
