Apricot Stone

Many, many years ago, when I was a little child
Mama told me you should know our world is cruel and wild
But to make your way through cold and heat
Love is all that you need

I believed her every word, more than anything I heard
But I was too scared to lose my fun
I began to cry a lot and she gave me apricots
Kisses of the earth, fruits of the sun

Apricot stone, hidden in my hand
Given back to me from the motherland
Apricot stone, I will drop it down in the frozen ground
I'll just let it make its round

Apricot stone, hidden in my hand
Given back to me from the motherland
Apricot stone

Now I see the northern stars shining brightly in the storm
And I've got an avatar of my love to keep me warm
Now I'm not afraid of violent winds
They may blow – they can't win

May the winter stay away from my harvest night and day
May God bless and keep my cherished fruit
Grow my tree up to the sky, once I waved my home goodbye
I just wanna go back to my roots

Apricot stone, hidden in my hand
Given back to me from the motherland
Apricot stone, I will drop it down in the frozen ground
I'll just let it make its round

Apricot stone, hidden in my hand
Given back to me from the motherland
Apricot stone, hidden in my hand
Given back to me from the motherlаnd
