I have the strength

A new day is waking
But the rain will come to us again
This gravestone by me is you

Don't touch these lips of mine, that isn't you
Leave me to dream, though a dream with you is just a dream

I have the strength to get over you
To not have you, and to not see you
And I spread my wings to fly over you
Through all, through all the heavens

Look, I'm going, to feel the warm wind on my face again
It's good to be free and alone
Free and alone

I have the strength to get over you
To not have you, and to not see you
And I spread my wings to fly over you
Through all, through all the heavens

A day is waking, a new day, a new problem
You're here with me, but again I'm lonely
I'm running from everything, even running from you
Little woman I just need to be by myself
I want to dream, I wanted to dream
But a dream with you is only a dream
And I have the strength to realise that you were never mine, ha

I have the strength to get over you
To not have you, and to not see you
And I spread my wings to fly over you
Through all, through all the heavens

I have the strength to get over you
To not have you, and to not see you
And I spread my wings to fly over you
Through all, through all the heаvenѕ
