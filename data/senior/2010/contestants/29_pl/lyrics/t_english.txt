The legend

Over the forest, over the mountain
There once lived a knight called Peacock Feather

Every day I think about tomorrow
Wanna see my princess much closer
I've decided never feeling sorrow
I will share my heart when I find her

I'll be forever, ever and ever
Feeling this love till the day when I die
Being together, even no matter
You didn't want me to be by your side

He kidnapped a girl from the castle
The chase after him was in vain

Lovely princess, I am here to save you
Take my hand and say that you love me
If you ever say it, even lying
I will let you fly like a bird – free

I'll be forever, ever and ever
Feeling this love till the day when I die
Being together, even no matter
You didn't want me to be by your side

I'll be forever, ever and ever
Feeling this love till the day when I die
Being together, even no matter
You didn't want me to be by your side

(I'll be forever, ever and ever) I'll be forever…
(Feeling this love till the day when I die)
(Being together even no matter) Forever
(You didn't want me to be by your side) You didn't want me by…

(The moral of this iѕ that)
(She didn't like the knight) Till the dаy I die…
(She didn't like the knight)
