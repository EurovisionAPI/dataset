Something tiny

Something tiny, something very small
A white rose, a caress, a sweet kiss and an apology
Something tiny, something very small
A tender gesture, a glance, a hug or a flower

Something tiny, something very small
A simple "I love you", with sweetness, with care and with passion
Is what I ask of you, my love, my life is falling down, you're breaking my heart
Try to change soon, time is now really running out

Something tiny, whoa... something very small, whoa...
Simple things you don't give me any more
Which I ask of you like crazy if you don't want this to be over

Something tiny, whoa... something very small, whoa...
You've got the chance in your hands
Today you decide whether to love me or break my heart

Something tiny, something very beautiful
Your hair in the wind that gets tangled between my hands getting warm
You've got to realise that it's small things that make this burn
Now try to change, 'cause everything else will eventually be sorted out

Something tiny, whoa... something very small, whoa...
Simple things you do give me now
'Cause I love you madly and I will always love you

Something tiny, whoa... something very small, whoa...
You've got the change in your hands
You decided to love me and not to break my heart
And not to break my heart

Something tiny, whoa... something very small, whoa...
Simple things you don't give me any more
Which I ask of you like crazy if you don't want this to be over

Something tiny, whoa... something very small, whoa...
You've got the chance in your handѕ
Today you decide whether to love me or break my heаrt
