This Is My Life

I go down the beaten track
'Long the river with an empty bag
At the end she said to me:
"Why are you here with the autumn leaves?"

'Cause this is my life, my friend
And this is my time to stand
Now this is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else

I'm done, tipping on my toes
Striking iron and attack my soul
Misty moon, you're gonna see
I've got your blues to get on my feet

'Cause this is my life, my friend
And this is my time to stand
'Cause this is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else

I don't wanna run, I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna hide, I just wanna stay free
To be me
I don't wanna win, I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna play, I just wanna remember
Oh, my name

'Cause this is my life, my friend
And this is my time to stand
Oh, ooh…

('Cause this is my life, my friend
(And this is my time to stand)
Now this is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else
'Cause this is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else

'Cаuse this iѕ my life, my friend
