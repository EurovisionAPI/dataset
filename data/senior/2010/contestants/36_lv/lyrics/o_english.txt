What for?

I've asked my angels why, but they don't know
What for do mothers cry and rivers flow?
Why are the skies so blue and mountains high?
What for is your love always passing by?

I've asked my uncle Joe, but he can't speak
Why does the wind still blow and blood still leaks?
So many questions now with no reply
What for do people live until they die?

What for are we living?
What for are we crying?
What for are we dying?
Only Mr God knows why

What for are we living?
What for are we dreaming?
What for are we losing?
Only Mr God knows why

But his phone today is out of range

The sun in colour black is rising high
The time is turning back, I wonder why
So many questions now with no reply
What for do people live until they die?

What for are we living?
What for are we crying?
What for are we dying?
Only Mr God knows why

What for are we living?
What for are we dreaming?
What for are we losing?
Only Mr God knows why

(What for are we living?) What for we're living?
(What for are we crying?) Crying
(What for are we dying?) Dying
(Only Mr God knows why) Mr God knows why

(What for are we living?)
(What for are we dreaming?) Dreaming
(What for are we losing?)
(Only Mr God knows why) Only God knows why

(Why)
(Only God knowѕ who we аre)
