Let there be (let there be, let there be) a change of the scene
Let everybody (let everybody, let everybody) go crazy about this sound
Let it run through the veins, let it strike right into the heart
Popular folk rock

Polka is the queen in the Slovenian land
It brings out dance, shrieks and laughter
Rock is the king of partying, sharp, but sincere
Hot like summer, colourful like autumn

But just one drop of creativity
Hides polka into a wild rhythm

Let there be (let there be, let there be) a shift in the mind
Let it be (let it be, let it be) like a positive shock
The feeling is right, let everybody be overwhelmed by
Popular folk rock

These country melodies bring out enthusiasm
A feeling of patriotism, love and pride
And rock spreads energy through guitar strings
Throughout the land, like a fire

But just a tiny bit of imagination
Hides rock into the polka rhythm

Let there be (let there be, let there be) a change of the scene
Let everybody (let everybody, let everybody) go crazy about this sound
Let it run through the veins, let it strike right into the heart
