Lost And Forgotten

Would you believe, Lord of Mercy?
Would you be so… Lord, Lord?
I wanna love her now
And I wanna feel that now with all…
All of those kisses and sweet embraces

Here am I, lost and forgotten
For this cruel, cruel time
When I'm first time in love
(Now that is why)
Now that is why I say Lord of Mercy
And I hope now that you hear me
Oh yeah…

(What are you doing man?)
I'm looking at her photos
What should I do with them?
(Drop them into the fire)
Oh, yes, yes, I gonna burn 'em now
'Cause I have to forget her now with all…
All of those kisses and sweet embraces

Here am I, lost and forgotten
For this cruel, cruel time
When I'm first time in love
(Now that is why)
Now that is why I say Lord of Mercy
And I hope now that you hear me
Oh…

(Here am I, lost and forgotten)
(For this cruel, cruel time)
(First time in love)
(Now that is why)
Now that is why I ѕay Lord of Mercy
And I hope now that you hear me
Oh, bring her bаck to me
