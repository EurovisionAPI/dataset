I'm in love (Sha-la-lee)

I've forgotten where I've heard this song, in the summer sun
I believe it was back there with you on the beach in Lisbon
Or was it back there in Paris behind a bowl of fresh mocha ice cream?
Or possibly, it was us two above the sea in an air balloon

Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala
I can't get it out of my head
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala
I get up with it in the morning

I'm in love with you
That's why I forget so quickly and don't know it anymore
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala
That's roughly how it goes

I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, that's quite noticeable

Or possibly, I was sitting together with you on a plane to Oslo
Or did it come from a bar in an alley, we were in Trinidad
Or was it with a good glass of wine at that sidewalk cafe in Berlin?
Or was it in Moscow where I've had my first kiss with you?

How can I, how can I…
How can I, how can I…
How can I possibly forget that?

Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala
I can't get it out of my head
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala
I get up with it in the morning

I'm in love with you
That's why I forget so quickly and don't know it anymore
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala
That's roughly how it goes

Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala
I can't get it out of my head
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala
I get up with it in the morning

I'm in love with you
That's why I forget so quickly and don't know it anymore
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala
That's roughly how it goes
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala
Yeѕ, I remember it agаin
