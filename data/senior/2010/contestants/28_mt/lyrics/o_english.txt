My Dream

We used to say that dreams could be so true
Where am I? What will I be?
It's my dream which I could share with you
A new day for you and me
Just a smile with warmth in my heart and go all the way
There's so much in life and I'll sing

This is my dream, I want to make it really happen
And make my dream come true
This is my dream, I'll make it if I just believe it
In a fairytale I'll live it, just like a new born star

Fly above like a seagull on the waves
And the sun will shine upon your face
Just believe, follow your heart and make it happen
Grow much brighter and we'll say

This is my dream, I want to make it really happen
And make my dream come true
This is my dream, I'll make it if i just believe it
There is nothing that could stop me
I just want the world to know

This is my dream, and I know that I'll be strong
It will come true because I know I'll make it happen
This iѕ my dreаm
