It's For You

Look into these eyes, hold onto these hands, believe in this heartbeat
Though you're afraid that I might break, just hold on
Shadows only haunt you when darkness crowds your heart
So let the light of my love shine bright

When I cry, it's for the lonely
When I pray, it's for the lost and stray
When I love like there's no tomorrow
No more words to say, it's for you

Look straight ahead, hold onto your dreams, believe in this magic
Open your eyes, open your mind and it's there
Shadows only haunt you when darkness crowds your heart
So let the light of my love shine bright

When I cry, it's for the lonely
When I pray, it's for the lost and stray
When I love like there's no tomorrow
No more words to say…

When shadows haunt you and darkness crowds your heart
Let the light of my love shine bright

When I cry, it's for the lonely
When I pray, it's for the lost and stray
When I love like there's no tomorrow
No more words to sаy, it's for you (It's for you)
It'ѕ for you
