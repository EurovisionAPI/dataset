Horehronie

When the sun goes down in <span class="lyrics_mark" data-mark="65zt4erjqe">Horehronie</span>
I want to sing, die and live
When the sun goes down in Horehronie
I wish I could get closer to the sky

I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
Of what, I don't even know
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point

The most beautiful trees are in Horehronie
A silent brotherhood is telling that
I come back here when I feel sad
The trees are saying: shake it off

I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
Of what, I don't even know
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point

Ah… hallelujah…

When the sun goes down in Horehronie
Out there somewhere far away our bell is ringing
When it hurts, let it hurt
One day it will vanish in the black mountain

I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
My eyes are crying softly
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point

Ah… ah… ah… ah…

I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
My eyes are crying softly
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point

The most beautiful treeѕ аre in Horehronie
