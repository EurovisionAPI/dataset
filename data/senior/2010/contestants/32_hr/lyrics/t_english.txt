Everything is easy

Easy, everything is easy, whenever I have you
Believe me, wherever I am, I know that I'm yours
You can see it by the glow in my eyes

Easy, everything is easy, because you're not leaving me
When I'm not smiling at you, I know I'm making a mistake
Because I'm just a woman who surrenders

With last shred of strength now, I'm standing here before you
My soul is being torn up by storms of unrest
It's harder to come to terms with this pain
Because you were cheated and it's killing me

Easy, everything is easy, because you know me best
While I'm standing here before you, you can see I'm scared
Because betrayal is written on my face

While I'm standing here before you, you can see I'm scared
Please forgive me, I love you, really love you
I can't live without you, I'm no longer myself
I'm no longer myself

Believe me, wherever I am, I know that I'm yours
You can see it by the glow in my eyes
Easy, everything is eаѕy
