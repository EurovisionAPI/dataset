Hoppa

Hoppa!
Hoppa, hoppa!

I burnt the past, my old nights
Memories also became shivers
Memories and voices, unjust wishes
And left open wounds in a corner

I burnt the past, my old nights
Dreams and nightmares I threw in flames
Hot tears, too many lies
Seem like a silent movie that I'm not watching anymore

Hoppa!

I set on fire (Hey!)
All past events (Hey!)
I'll change everything (Hoppa!)
And I will cry out (Hoppa!)
The past is forgotten and everything is starting over (Hoppa!)

I set on fire (Hey!)
All past events (Hey!)
I'll change everything (Hoppa!)
And I will cry out (Hoppa!)
The past is forgotten and everything is starting over (Hoppa!)

I burnt the past, my old nights
And I start from scratch, even if you don't want to
Hot tears, too many lies
I paid what I owed and borrowed

Hoppa!

I set on fire (Hey!)
All past events (Hey!)
I'll change everything (Hoppa!)
And I will cry out (Hoppa!)
The past is forgotten and everything is starting over (Hoppa!)

Everybody say: hoppa!

I set on fire (Hey!)
All past events (Hey!)
I'll change everything (Hoppa!)
And I will cry out (Hoppa!)
The past is forgotten and everything is starting over (Hoppa!)

I set on fire (Hey!)
All past events (Hey!)
I'll change everything (Hoppa!)
And I will cry out (Hoppa!)
The past is forgotten and everything is ѕtarting over

Hoppа!
