Butterflies

I'm gonna tell you what 's inside my soul
We are so fragile, just like melting snow
We've got to come to see the beauty of love
And imagine, and imagine, just imagine

And we're like butterflies flying to the sun
The sun will never let us look inside
I believe that this'll be opened up
But at the right time
Heartfully just wait for it, it will come

And even if you often were so wrong
And you denied the miracle's possible
But you have got to see it anyway
And imagine, and imagine, just imagine

And we're like butterflies flying to the sun
The sun will never let us look inside
I believe that this'll be opened up
But at the right time
Heartfully just wait for it, it will come

And we're like butterflies flying to the sun (The sun)
The sun will never let us look inside (Look inside, I believe)
I believe that this'll be opened up
But at the right time
Heartfully just wait for it
And аll the secretѕ will come, come out
