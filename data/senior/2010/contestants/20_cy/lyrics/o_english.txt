Life Looks Better In Spring

Time changes everything, even you and I have changed
The rain the winters bring has made us fade away
I still remember everything, that old December, the fears, the cold
I really wonder how you feel on these nights, all alone

I hope someday you'll see me
I hope someday you'll spot me in the crowd
Take my hand and kiss me
I hope someday you'll say my name out loud

(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings, tell me about your stories
Look into my eyes and come on closer, make me immortal with a kiss
(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings, tell me about your stories
We know it's over, so tell me it's over and life will be better in spring

Time changes everything, but this feeling, it still remains
The sweetness of the lips I kissed will always be the same

I hope someday you'll see me
I hope someday you'll spot me in the crowd
Smile and say you miss me
I hope someday you'll say my name out loud

(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings, tell me about your stories
Look into my eyes and come on closer, make me immortal with a kiss
(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings, tell me about your stories
We know it's over, so tell me it's over and life will be better in spring

(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings, tell me about your stories
Look into my eyes and come on closer, make me immortal with a kiss
(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings, tell me about your stories
We know it's over, so tell me it's over аnd life will be better in ѕpring
