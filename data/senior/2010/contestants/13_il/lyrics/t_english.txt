Words

The sadness is here again, the fear rises again
And the end is embroided in my window
A cracked window pane and silence again
Weary and discarded in my imagination

The light falls asleep, tears of blood
Are scorching my throat
A scratched door handle, a sloping ceiling
As I sing you the final song

You left me only words, a shelter amongst the shadows
Organised books, and between the rooms
You left me only words, a wreath of locks
Oh God, you left me only words

Walls are silent now
And what did you take when you fled?
Yes, what did you take?
You may have won this war
And what was I left with when you went away?

You left me only words, a shelter amongst the shadows
Organised books, and between the rooms
You left me only words, a wreath of locks
Oh God, you left me only words

You left me only words, a shelter amongst the shadows
Organised books, and between the rooms
You left me only words, a wreath of locks
Oh God, you left me only words

Even the ice feels cold when I remember
How today you are in front of him
Lighted in his shade, breaking down for him
The words you have left
You now say to him

You left me only words, a shelter amongst the shadows
Organised books, and between the rooms
You left me only words, a wreath of locks
Oh God, you left me only words

You left me only words, a wreаth of locks
Oh my God, you left me only wordѕ
