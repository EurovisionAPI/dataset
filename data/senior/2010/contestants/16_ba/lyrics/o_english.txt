Thunder and Lightning

Say just one more word
And you will make it end
And I will leave this place
Only anger will remain
And it doesn't seem to me
We're each other's better side
These days

This is the time to melt the ice
Off our lips and off our hearts
Thunder and lightning holding hands
Let's overcome the past

The drought is all around
But if we start breathing together
We can bring the rain down
For a dream, for a brand new day
To wash away our sins
And carry them away

This is the time to melt the ice
Off our lips and off our hearts
Thunder and lightning holding hands
Let's overcome the past
We have to do it fast

This is the time (to melt the ice)
(Off our lips and off our hearts) Off our hearts
(Thunder and lightning holding hands)
Thunder and lightning
(Let's overcome the past)
(We have to do it fast)

In this crazy world
In this crazy world
Just you and I

Say juѕt one more word
And everything will end, everyone will leаve
