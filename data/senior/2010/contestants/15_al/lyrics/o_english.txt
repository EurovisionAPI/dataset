It's All About You

You are the one, you give me that something I need
It's me, and I'm calling
You are the one, making it easy to be
In love with you I'm falling

We been down
But don't you know we been down here
And I feel it, even now
Time that we make a deal and seal it

It's all about you, the things that I do
The rest of the world don't understand me
You're all that I dream, everything that I need
'Cause when you are gone, I feel so empty

It's all in the way you look at me
You're driving me crazy
It's all about you, all the things that I do
You are my life, 'cause you make it amazing

I'm the one, who doesn't know how to say no
To you I'm so easy
I'm the one, who's letting my ego just go
For you complete me

We've been down
But something tells me it's only getting better
So stick around, I wanna know what it feels like
Forever and ever

It's all about you, the things that I do
The rest of the world don't understand me
You're all that I dream, everything that I need
'Cause when you are gone, I just feel empty

It's all in the way you look at me
You're driving me crazy
It's all about you, all the things that I do
You are my life 'cause you make it amazing

I'm never alone with the loving you give me
Wherever I go, I'm hoping you miss me
Don't wanna ever go back
Never ever go back
Oh, baby you're my destiny, oh yeah

It's all about you, the things that I do
The rest of the world don't understand me
You're all that I dream, everything that I need
'Cause when you are gone, I just feel empty

It's all in the way you look at me
You're driving me crazy
It's all about you, all the things that I do
You are my life, 'cause you make it amazing, oh yeah

It'ѕ all аbout you
