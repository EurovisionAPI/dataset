It's raining gold

Pam dadadam dadadam…
Padada dadadam…
Padadam padadam…

At the horizon, a touch of silver
Like after a storm, the clouds disappear
The summer nights, forgotten dream
Thanks to your perfume, I find my way back

It's raining gold, each time you talk to me about love
It's raining gold, let's leave together for the big journey
Under the starry vault, the destinies are golden
It's raining gold

Pam padadam padadam…
Padada dadadam…
Padadam padadam…

And in the morning, shared secrets
The exchanged glances are accomplice of summer
The day chases magic
The shimmering eyes remain

It's raining gold, each time you talk to me about love (It's raining gold)
It's raining gold, let's leave together for the big journey
Under the starry vault, the destinies are golden
It's raining gold, the whole night and until the dawn
It's raining gold

Dance with me, fly with me
Speak quietly, speak with me

(It's raining gold) It's raining gold
(It's raining gold)

It's raining gold, let's leave together for the big journey
Under the starry vault, the destinies are golden
It's raining gold, the whole night and until the dawn
It'ѕ rаining gold
