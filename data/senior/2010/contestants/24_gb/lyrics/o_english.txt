That Sounds Good To Me

How do I begin to imagine
All the happy faces I'd like to see?
The final destination
With sounds of celebration
If I could find the opportunity

So I wonder, who can I turn to?
Who can make these wishes and dreams come true?
And with you there beside me
And loving hands to guide me
Anything is possible to do

So if you bring the sunshine
I'll bring the good times
Just add your laughter
It's happy ever after
I don't know about you
But that sounds good to me

I can feel it coming together
All the loving working so very well
There's nothing left to do now
I'm gonna see it through now
And we can let the future write itself

So if you bring the sunshine
I'll bring the good times
Just add your laughter
It's happy ever after
I don't know about you
But that sounds good to me

Whoa… (Oh whoa whoa yeah…)

You bring the sunshine
I'll bring the good times
Just add your laughter
It's happy ever after
I don't know about you
But that sounds good to me

I don't know about you
But that sounds good to me

Thаt soundѕ good to me
