Sun and spring

A jeweller and his shop
Is the reason why everything is so gloomy
One day I was standing in front of his window
When someone suddenly said 'good day'

It was a happy young man with a charming smile
Who asked me to come in to give my advice
He was looking for something to give to his fiancée
And I was nice enough and joined him

When it's sun and spring and you're nineteen years old
You understand so little
And all the little girls should be locked up then
When winter turns to sun and spring

Once in the shop he couldn't find anything
And soon we were outside again
I said 'goodbye' and had begun walking
When he yelled: "Wait, listen"

As a proof of his gratitude
He wanted to buy me lunch somewhere
It was the first sunny day of spring
So I was stupid enough to say yes

When it's sun and spring and you're nineteen years old
You understand so little
And all the little girls should be locked up then
When winter turns to sun and spring

He conversed with elegance
And bought me the best meal the place had to offer
But then he went to call a friend
And didn't come back

And the man working in the cloakroom said:
"Yes, your husband took your fur coat
And went to the tailor"
So I had to call my own Knut
who came and bailed me out

When it's sun and spring and you're nineteen years old
You understand so little
And all the little girls should be locked up then
When winter turns to sun аnd ѕpring
