Your name

Your name that is playing with my name
Trying to get it and to erase yours
Your joy that is singing with my joy
So they would fuse together

Your heart that is playing with my heart
With a lot of luck, of passionate luck
And then your hand that is holding mine
And guiding me through the shadow to the sun

We don't need complicated romances
Like those of lovers in movies
We don't need to put on an act
Luck is as I see it

Your name that is playing with my name
Trying to get it and to erase yours
Your joy that sings with my joy
So that they would fuse together

Your heart that is playing with my heart
With a lot of luck, of passionate luck
And then your hand that is holding mine
And guiding me through the shаdow to the sun

To the ѕun
