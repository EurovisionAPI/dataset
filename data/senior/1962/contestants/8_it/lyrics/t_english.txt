Goodbye, goodbye

My smiles and yours are extinguished
We're walking together and we're alone
There are only long silences left which mean:
Goodbye, goodbye

Our love has become salt like sea water
Our parched lips don't have words any longer

Look at me, look at me, you know that it isn't true
It isn't true that our love has ended

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at me, look at me, listen to me, hold on
It isn't true, because you're crying

Because we know (Becauѕe we know)
That we love each other (That we love each other)
That we love each other and that we're breаking up

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
