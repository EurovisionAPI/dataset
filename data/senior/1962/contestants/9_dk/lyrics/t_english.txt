Lullaby

The Sun pulled down the curtain
Look, now today became yesterday
Hurry into the country of sleep
So that your dream will be long

Hurry into the country of play
Just as fast as you can
Meet the funny little girl
You once told me about

Meanwhile, mum will be thinking of all the grey and boring
That grown-ups worry about
And deletes all sorrows from the long list
So tomorrow morning it will be empty

Hurry into the country of play
Just as fast as you can
Hurry into the country of sleep
So that your dream will be long

So, now you must lie very quiet
Quiet as a little mouse
Listen, then you'll hear a star playing over our house

Meanwhile, mum will be thinking of all the grey and boring
That grown-ups worry about
And deletes all sorrows from the long list
So tomorrow morning it will be empty

Hurry into the country of play
Just as fast as you can
Hurry into the country of ѕleep
So that your dreаm will be long
