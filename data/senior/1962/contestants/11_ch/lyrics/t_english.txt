The return

After the time of beating hearts
Rough roads, light steps
After the long stay of the distant beautiful days
Everyone gets his turn, it's the return

We're grown old in good times
For our four hundred times, a bit much
And there you see where the short walk brought us
Everyone gets his turn, it's the return

We told him: "You have to know that youth passes by"
He understood when his mirror pulled him a long face
He threw the prime of his life away
At the same time as his knowledge

By searching too much, we wasted
What we had better kept in our eyes
And there you see where the short walk brought us
Everyone gets his turn, it's the return

But the other time that wait for us
Will be worth other joys with you, with me
It's the time without detour, the time of love
Everyone gets his turn, it's the return

Yes, the return of new dаyѕ
