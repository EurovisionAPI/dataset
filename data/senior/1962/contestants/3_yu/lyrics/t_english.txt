Don't turn the lights on at twilight

In the warm darkness of the room, two cigarettes
Two tiny lights are closer and closer
This night is made for them, this dream is so slow and quiet
Two stars will now depart on a long journey

In the blue glass of the vase, under the roses
Two tiny lights are closer and closer
That day was so quiet, now sleep is descending upon them
You're putting out your cigarete, embracing sleep

That day was so quiet, now sleep is descending upon them
Two stars will depart on a long journey

In the blue glass of the vase, under the roses
Two tiny lights are closer and closer
This night is made for them, now sleep is coming, so quiet
You're putting out your cigarete, embracing sleep

Don't turn the lightѕ on аt twilight
