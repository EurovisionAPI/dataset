Call me

(Call me, call me)

You're the pruned branch
In the tree of my dreams
Love that is nothing
But it's you

(La la la la la)
(La la la la la)
(La la la la la la)

(La la la la la)
(La la la la la la la la)

Call me, call me if you cry
Call me if you lose the route of your life (lalalala)
Count always on me
Like the friend that never forgets
(Doo doo doo wa doo wa)

Call me (pow), call me if you suffer (pow)
Call me if you feel that the world abandons you
Call me and your sin will be forgotten
By just saying 'come'

Call me if you need me
If you see the open abyss at your feet
Call me if you are lost
But don't ask me to believe in you again

(La, lalalala)
(Lalalala, lalalala)
(Ta too da too da)
(Ta too da too da)
(Ta too da too da ta)
(Lala, lalalala)

Call me if you need me
If you see the open abyss at your feet
Call me if you're lost
But don't aѕk me to believe in you again

(Lala, lala, la)
Call me if you cry
If you need me, cаll me
