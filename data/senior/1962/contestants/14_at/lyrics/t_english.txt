Only in the air of Vienna

Only in the air of Vienna you smell that special scent
Of a certain sweet waltz melody
When you look out of your window
You hear the sound of Johann Strauss
And the magic of his waltz poetry

And every child of Vienna loves this wind
Rushing and blustering like an imaginative child
Often he can be gentle, often he is stormy like young wine
Magician of Vienna, Waltz of Vienna

St Stephen's Cathedral, the city hall man
Sacher cake and sausage vendor
Are well known by every child in the world
About our grilled chicken, Schubert and the National Opera
Grandfather already told

And also the Grinzing and Burgtheater
Schrammeln and the main avenue
Are our specialities
But one important thing is still missing
You can't read it in the Baedecker

Only in the air of Vienna you smell that special scent
Singing and sounding he brings you to Phantasia.
Often he can be gentle, often he is stormy like young wine
Magician of Vienna, Waltz of Vienna

And every child of Vienna loves this wind
Rushing and blustering like an imaginative child
Often he can be gentle, often he is stormy like young wine
Waltz of Viennа, yeѕ
