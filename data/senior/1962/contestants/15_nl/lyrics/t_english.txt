Katinka

Every morning, at half past eight
We meet Katinka
Red bonnet and blond locks
Bright yellow shirt, blue skirt
But she trips silently beside her mum
That's why all the boys who long for her, sing

Little coquettish Katinka
Now, look round for once
Sneaky over your shoulder
Your mum doesn't see it, so come on
Little coquettish Katinka
Are you maybe shy?
We really want to see for a moment
A glimpse of your tip-tilted nose

Every morning, sun or rain
We meet Katinka
Heels tick-tack on the sidewalk
Short skirt with narrow cut
But her look doesn't betray no or yes
That's why all the boys who long for her, sing

Little coquettish Katinka
Now, look round for once
Sneaky over your shoulder
Your mum doesn't see it, so come on
Little coquettish Katinka
Are you maybe shy?
We really want to see for a moment
A glimpse of your tip-tilted nose

Little coquettish Katinka
Now, look round for once
Sneaky over your shoulder
Your mum doesn't see it, so come on
Little coquettish Katinka
Are you maybe shy?
We really want to see for a moment
A glimpse of your tip-tilted noѕe
