Come sun, come rain

Come sun, come rain, come what may come
As long as you are here
Come sun, come rain, as long as we exist
For you, for me, happiness is always close

Rain becomes sunshine when only you smile at me
The two of us walk along the path of summer
Come sun, some rain, what could happen when I
Have everything I could wish for in you

I hoped many times: A day must come, my day
But the doubt planted seeds of unease in my mind
My world was so stressful, and I went along with its rush
But then you came and then the world was mine

Come sun, come rain, the only thing I know
Our happiness remаins with uѕ when we
Hold on to our love
