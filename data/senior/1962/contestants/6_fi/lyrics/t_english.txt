Chirpy-chirp

Chirpy-chirp, chirpy, chirpy, chirpy-chirp
The spring is wonderful
Chirpy-chirp, chirpy, chirpy, chirpy-chirp
It was told by a bird
Chirpy-chirp, chirpy, chirpy, chirpy-chirp
Let's hasten to find
Chirpy-chirp, chirpy, chirpy, chirpy-chirp
A sweetheart for both of us

When we're singing in chorus, each one here on its branch
We can make it be heard further, the call of love

Chirpy-chirp, chirpy, chirpy, chirpy-chirp
I also built a nest
Chirpy-chirp, chirpy, chirpy, chirpy-chirp
Come along my dearest

The spring with happy wings floats for us too
It comes twiddling its sunny hoop

La la la… la la la…
La la la… la la la la…
Chirpy-chirp, chirpy, chirpy, chirpy-chirp
Chirpy-chirp, chirpy, chirpy, chirpy-chirp

When we're singing in chorus, each one here on its branch
We can make it be heard further, the call of love

Chirpy-chirp, chirpy, chirpy, chirpy-chirp
I also built a nest
Chirpy-chirp, chirpy, chirpy, chirpy-chirp
Come along my dearest
Come along my deаreѕt
Chirpy-chirp
