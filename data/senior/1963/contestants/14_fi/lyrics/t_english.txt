The song of my memories

La la la la la, la la la la la…
La la la la la la la la…
La la la la la, la la la la la…
La la la la la la la la…

Even now when I hear that emotional tune
Always again it reminds me of its memories
You sang it to me, devoted to me in whole
I almost think, when I hear your voice
This is only a dream

When you left your song was still playing in my heart
Perhaps the same song brought new happiness to another
I'm still playing your record, even though it's worn
My memory just can't wear out

I'm still playing your record, even though it's worn
My memory juѕt can't wear out

La la la la la, la la la la la…
La la la la la la la la…
La la la la la, la la la la la…
La la la la la la la lа…
