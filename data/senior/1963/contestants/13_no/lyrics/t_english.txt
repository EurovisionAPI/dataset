Solstice

In the embrace of the winter night with stars without names
When snow, ice and frost covers everything on earth
A morning ready for dawn and night becomes day again
An hour of dawn beats for my tired heart

When the sun has turned its course
And the day has lit its lights
When you are with me, then the night is over
We're humming a happy melody

Now we walk with spring in our minds
Towards summer and heat from the sun
And the days come, and the days go
In the dawning spring of love

My own, you are so dear to me
You're the symbol of light
Our winter is distant, our summer is near
And you are my heart's beloved

When the sun has turned its course
And the day has lit its lights
Our winter is distant, but our summer is near
In the spаrkling glow of the morning ѕun
