Love goes away

Love goes away, and yours wouldn't last
Like the others, one fine day you're going to leave me
If it isn't you, it will be me who will go away
Love goes away, and we can't change anything about that

For you're also going to tell me a thousand forevers
And I'll also say them again in my turn

Love goes away, I escape from you when you chase after me
Or it's me who refuses to believe everything is finished
And every time, someone will always have to admit it
Love goes away, but without ѕtopping, we run аfter
