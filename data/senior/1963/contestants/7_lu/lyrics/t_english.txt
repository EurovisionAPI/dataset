By persistently praying

By persistently praying, every night, every day
By persistently begging all the gods of love
By persistently singing your name like a poem
By persistently loving you, it will be necessary that you love me

By persistently praying from the depth of my heart
And by despairing to find the happiness
When I will have cried until my sorrow is over
By persistently calling, it will be necessary that you come

By persistently praying and by living of hope
The sun rose painfully on the fog
I'm going to be able to sing, shout, shout victory
My turn came, this day came
By persiѕtently prаying, love… love… love
