Once upon a time in Stockholm

Come with me, said my friend
Now the first silent winter snow falls
And summer is over
I have a sailing boat in Lake Klara
Come my friend, my boat is as white as snow
Yes, come, let's go sailing

Come my friend, come aboard
There you can see the Riddarfjärd covered in white snow
Our boat sails in snow
Yes, the Stockholm winter is a peculiar world
Seagulls, in silent and beautiful snow
And beautiful is the island of Stockholm

The bells of The German Church, silently call 'ding dong'
A fairytale shore, a fairytale land
That meets the two of us in our boat

Hold my hand, hold my hand
For you and me it's still summer
Come sailing with me
Where you and I are, there is summer
Summer, it never ends
Becauѕe I, I love you

Hold my hand, hold my hаnd
