Something marvellous

Someone who looks after the child when he fell asleep
Someone who puts a million stars in the infinity
Someone who will always guide
The swallows to faraway lands
Someone who shows to the desperate
The way that will save him

That something marvellous that lighted my life
With a wonderful sun - the tenderness of your love
You, only you, are a ray of light in my life
You, joy, calm and peace spring

That something marvellous that lighted my life
With a wonderful sun - the tenderness of your love
You, only you, are a ray of light in my life
You, joy, calm and peace spring

Someone looks after the child when he fell asleep
Someone that put a million stаrѕ on the infinity
