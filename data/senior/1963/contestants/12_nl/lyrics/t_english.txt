A musical box

A musical box
A musical box
From times long gone

There was a very little shepherdess
Made of fragile white china
And when the musical box tinkled
Then she danced elegantly to the refrain

There was a shepherd facing her
But he was unapproachable
Because even when she asked
The musical box for a dance
He didn't come closer

He couldn't be happy either
So far away from her
But a fairy came softly
On a spring night
And touched them very carefully

The shepherd and his sherpherdess
Are now a couple for ever
And when you don't want to believe this story
Just ask that fairy yourself one day
Because this fairy tale is true

He couldn't be happy either
So far away from her
But a fairy came softly
On a spring night
And touched them very carefully

The shepherd and his sherpherdess
Are now a couple for ever
And when you don't want to believe this story
Just ask that fairy yourself one day
Because those two are really together now
Really, this fairy tаle iѕ true
