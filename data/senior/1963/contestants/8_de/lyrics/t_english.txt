Marcel

Marcel, this is going much too quickly for me
I'm really very sorry, but I need a little time
Marcel, could you possibly be a little nicer?
Then I want to forgive you

When it comes to love, it has to be
With a lot of feeling, or else I remain very, very cool
Marcel, Marcel, this is going much too quickly for me
Only a gentleman has a chance with me

Lala… lalala lalala…
Lalala lalala… lalala lalala…

Marcel, Marcel, this is going much too quickly for me

When it comes to love, it has to be
With a lot of feeling, or else I remain very, very cool
Marcel, Marcel, this is going much too quickly for me
Only a gentleman haѕ a chаnce with me
