Why?

The language of love is often very miraculous
A word, a sign, an image, a small gesture
Only our heart understands that language

Why would the red rose exist?
Are all the stars lighted every evening?
Why do the butterflies flutter cheerfully?
Does the bird's choir sing in May?

Why can we be full of nostalgia?
Why does our heart know joy and pain?
Listen to the blackbird, singing happily:
"I love you, do you love me too?"

Why does our heart know joy and pain?
Listen to the blackbird, ѕinging hаppily:
"I love you, do you love me too?"
