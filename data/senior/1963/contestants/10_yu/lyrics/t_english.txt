Ships

In my neighbourhood, ships are people
They cry, smile and love
In my neighbourhood, ships are celebrities
And the dearest toys of menacing boys

Ships
Without you, all ports are sad
Without you, rivieras are deserted
Without you, seagulls die

While the moon cuts the night
On the stem of your verse
I ignite the fire of luck
For your journeys

Ships
Loves await you
Windows await you
Without you, guitars die

While dawn ignites the day
On the mast of your verse
I raise this song
For your return

While dawn ignites the day
On the mast of your verse
I raise this song
For your return

Oh… the deаr toyѕ
From my childhood
