Strings Of My Heart

Aha… aha…
Stay now and softly play the strings of my heart

Don't break my heart tonight, don't leave me when I cry
Stay now and softly play the strings of my heart
I want you by my side, you make me feel all right
And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart
And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart

Don't break my heart tonight, don't leave me when I cry
Stay now and softly play the strings of my heart
I want you by my side, you make me feel all right
And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart

Don't break my heart, oh no
(Don't break my heart, don't break my heart, don't break my heart)
I want you by my side, you make me feel all right
(Right by my side, right by my side, I feel all right)
And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart
(Strings of my heart)
And let the fiddler play on the stringѕ of my heаrt
