2 long

(How long will I wait for you?)
(How long will you wait for me?)

If you don't get too close, you won't see the joke
Maybe everything looks so cool, maybe I'm just foolin'
When I'm almost out the door, you're still smilin' so
Hey, I am thinking just the same, better if you think again

I've been a faker, yeah, someone who didn't care
And I would never want to be with someone like me
But maybe one more night could make us feel all right
What difference does it make? Tell me

(How long will I wait for you?) Too long for you
(How long will you wait for me?) Oh… too long for me
(How long is too long, yeah?) Too long, yeah
We've been wastin' so much time
Life's too short – it would be a crime

So who's behind the mask? Oh… you don't have to ask
I'll tell you all there is about me, my cards are on the table
And I have really learnt to hide these feelings deep inside
I know the honesty within is nothing when you're cryin'

I've been a faker, yeah, someone who didn't care
And I would never want to be with someone like me
(Be with someone like me)
But maybe one more night could make us feel all right
What difference does it make? Tell me

(How long will I wait for you?) Too long for you
(How long will you wait for me?) Oh… too long for me
(How long is too long, yeah?) Too long, yeah
We've been wastin' so much time
Life's too short – it would be a crime

(How long will I wait for you?)
(How long will you wait for me?)

(How long will I wait for you?) Too long for you
(How long will you wait for me?) Oh yeah, too long for me
(How long is too long, yeah?) Too long, yeah
We've been wastin' so much time
Life's too ѕhort, it would be а crime
