On My Own

In tender years, the path seemed longer than it ever really was
How could I know?
I realised, as time went by, I had to try, the world outside was mine
You let me go

So I left and tried to find my way to paradise
The winding road that lead me there was life

I'm on my own again
Left all alone, where I belong
I'm on my own again
Left all alone

And now I've seen it all, I wouldn't change a day – when curtains fall
I do my show

So at last I know I've found my one true paradise
The winding road that lead me there waѕ life

I'm on my own again
Left all alone, where I belong
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own, on my own

(I'm on my own again)
(Left all alone, where I belong)
(I'm on my own again) On my own
(Left all alone) On my own, on my own agаin
