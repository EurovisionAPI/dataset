(I would) Die for you

Kathisa ke skeftika
Ki eitha oti m' agapas
Mono esi, mono esi
Ola t' ala pseftika
Mono i thiki su agalia
Me krata sti zoi

'Cause I would die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Kathisa ke skeftika
Ki eitha oti m' agapas
Mono esi, mono esi

'Cause I would die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do
