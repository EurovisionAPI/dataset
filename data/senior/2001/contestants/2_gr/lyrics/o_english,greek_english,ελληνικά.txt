(I would) Die for you

Κάθησα και σκέφτηκα
Κι είδα ότι μ' αγαπάς
Μόνο εσύ, μόνο εσύ
Όλα τ' αλλα ψεύτικα
Μόνο η δίκη σου αγκαλιά
Με κρατά στη ζωή

'Cause I would die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Καθησά και σκέφτηκα
Κι είδα ότι μ' αγαπάς
Μόνο εσύ, μονό εσύ

'Cause I would die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

'Cаuѕe I would die for you
