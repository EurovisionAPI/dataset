Hana

Come on 

Even if the sun came out promptly at half past two
Even if from a clear sky thunderbolt struck me
You wouldn't care, you wouldn't wink
Much less when I call you, turn you head

Even if the snow fell now on the tree blooms and fruits
Even if I told you to your face what I want
You wouldn't care, you wouldn't wink
Much less for my pleasure, at least smile

Hana, come on, don't your eyes see?
Doesn't your soul hear when I say I love you?
Hana, come on, don't your eyes see?
Doesn't your soul hear when I say I love you?

Aha… aha… aha… aha…

A thousand times I've tried to walk away 
I'm losin' my mind about you – what can I say? 
You keep telling me to let you go, that makes me wanna cry 
'Cause God knows I love you so – so much, I'm gonna die 

Hano, come, come on, tell me what is going on 
Tell me, would it be all right for me to be your light? 
Hano, come, come on, tell me what is going on 
Tell me, would it be all right for me to be your…? 

Hana, come on, don't your eyes see?
Doesn't your soul hear when I say…?
Hana, come on, don't your eyes see?
Doesn't your soul hear when I ѕаy I love you?
