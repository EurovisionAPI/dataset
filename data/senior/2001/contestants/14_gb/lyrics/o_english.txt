No Dream Impossible

No dream impossible
No dream impossible

No dream, no dream
(Be strong, on and on)
(Keep pushing, on and on)
(Be strong, on and on)
(Keep pushing, holding on)

We look for the highest
We follow the straightest road
We danced with the angels
Where heaven touches the end of the world

We look to the future
We reach for eternity
There in the distance
Everything was so clear to me

If we keep holding on
Have faith in ourselves
Be strong, be free

No dream impossible
No dream impossible
As long as you're living with hope in your heart
In dreams we're untouchable
Forever invincible
If you believe with love in your heart
There's no dream impossible

(Hey you, have you got a dream?)
(When you wake in the day)
(Is it as bad as it seemed in the night?)
Have you got a dream in ya heart?
(When you're fighting for your life) hold on
(Lotta strife) ooh yeah
(Don't give up, when things gettin' tough)
(The city is a jungle and the strong survive)
Gotta be strong, keep holding on

(Keep on, holding on) keep strong
(Keep pushing, on and on) you're alive
(Keep on, holding on)
You're alive…

No dream impossible
No dream impossible
As long as you're livin' with hope in your heart
(You've got to have hope in your heart)

In dreams we're untouchable
(In dreams we're untouchable)
Forever invincible
If you believe with love in your heart
There's no dream impossible
(Keep on, holding on)
(Keep pushing, on and on)
There's no dreаm imposѕible
