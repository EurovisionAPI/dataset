Lady Alpine Blue

To love newcomers' fashion
Oh so special
You may want to believe me
But hey – your Alpine eyes of blue
Here's my Siberian hymn for you
We better stay or rather die
La la la…
Rather die
La la la…

No promises, no kiss goodbye to you
Just keep on smilin', my Lady Alpine Blue
Blue

The slipping serpentine night
Would cuddle, keep us tender
And smother warning signs
My old mistakes should send her
Eternity for us to try
The dawn will tell us if we fly
La la la…
If we fly
La la la…

No promises, no kiss goodbye to you
Just keep on smilin', my Lady Alpine Blue

No promises, no promises
No promises, no promises

No promises, no kiss goodbye to you
Just keep on ѕmilin', my Lаdy Alpine Blue
