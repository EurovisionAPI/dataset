Tell her that I love her

If you see her, ask her what she feels
If still something remains of that love that united us
If you find her quite indifferent
Make her see reason, and do me this favour
Talk to her, insist on her that they've done us damage
That everything is a lie

Tell her that I love her, that I was always sincere
Tell her that I'm going crazy because of this nonsense
Tell her that I'm sailing between love and fear
Tell her that this melancholy is killing me

(Tell her) that I love her
(Tell her) that I'm sincere
(Tell her) Tell her that this melancholy is killing me

If you see her, remind her that she has
The doors of my heart wide open
Tell her that my tears don't understand
Why she isn't with me in this room
Talk to her, insist on her that that they've done us damage
That everything is a lie

Tell her that I love her, that I was always sincere
Tell her that I'm going crazy because of this nonsense
Tell her that I'm sailing between love and fear
Tell her that this melancholy is killing me

(Tell her, tell her, tell her) Tell her that I'm going crazy
(Tell her, tell her, tell her)

Tell her that I love her, that I was always sincere
Tell her that I'm going crazy because of this nonsense
Tell her that I'm sailing between love and fear
Tell her that this melancholy is killing me

Tell her that I love her, that I was always sincere
Tell her that I'm going crazy because of this nonsense
Tell her that I'm sailing between love and fear
Tell her that this melаncholy iѕ killing me

Tell her
