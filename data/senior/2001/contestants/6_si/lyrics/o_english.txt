Energy

Energy
Oh, what you do to me
Your rhythm runs right through me
You're my destiny
My whole life is one big fantasy
And yet the closer that I get, you're further away

Energy
I feel such energy
Electric runs right through me
I'm in ecstasy
Your caress, the sweetness on your lips
But the closer that I get, you're drifting away

With every heartbeat, I'm electrified
With just one look
Your body moves me, moves me
If for one second you'd remember me
Then I would break free
From these chains that are wrapped around me

Energy
I feel such energy
Your rhythm runs right through me
I'm in ecstasy
Your caress, the sweetness on your lips
But the closer that I get, you're drifting away

Oh, energy
I feel such energy
Electric runs right through me
You're my destiny, oh…
My whole life is one big fantasy, oh…
And all I am meаnѕ nothing till you're here with me

Energy
