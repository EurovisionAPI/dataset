Out on my own

Closing the door, leaving behind all that has been
No turn around, life begins out on my own

Follow the sun from day to day, free as a bird
Now is the time to spread my wings out on my own

Come to the conclusion I am in control
Take it with my body and my soul

I can fly over mountains, over seas
I never felt so free in the choices of my life
I can fly over mountains, over seas
I never felt so free in the choices of my life

Closing the door, leaving behind all that has been
Now is the time to spread my wings out on my own

Come to the conclusion I am in control
Take it with my body and my soul

I can fly over mountains, over seas
I never felt so free in the choices of my life
I can fly over mountains, over seаs
I never felt so free in the choices of my life

Free in the choices of my life
Free in the choiceѕ of my life
