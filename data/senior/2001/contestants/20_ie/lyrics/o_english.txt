Without Your Love

I don't want to live my life without you
I don't ever want to say goodbye
'Cause you're the only one that I am here for
Never want to see you cry

But I can't go on (Can't go on)
Oh no
No, I can't go on (I can't go on)
Oh no

Without your love, without your heart
I'd be lost here, in the dark
I just don't know
Where would I be without your love?
You're the light in the dark

I want to wake up with you beside me
I will never let this feeling die
I just want to be here in the morning
To see the sunlight in your eyes

But I can't go on (Can't go on)
Oh no
No, I can't go on (I can't go on)
Oh no

Without your love, without your heart
I'd be lost here, in the dark
I just don't know
Where would I be without your love?

Without your love, without your heart
I'd be lost here, in the dark
I juѕt don't know
Where would I be without your love?
You're the light in the dаrk
