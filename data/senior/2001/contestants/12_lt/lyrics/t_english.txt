You Got Style

Hey you, sittin' over there lookin' so fine
And I can't deny, given a while, we could spend some time
And see if there's more to you than meets the eye
'Cause you sure look fine and you sure got style, yeah yeah

You look so divine that you blow my mind
Think I'll make you mine, yeah
You look so divine that you blow my mind
Think I'll make you mine, think I'll make you mine

(You got style, you got style,) yeah
(You got style,) baby
You got style, you got style
You got style, (baby)
I think I'll make you mine

Hey you, with the smile so sweet
Make all the girlies weak with that sleek physique
But once we meet I'll probably see you're no good to be true
Just another cute fool, but one thing I know is true

You look so divine that you blow my mind
Think I'll make you mine, yeah
You look so divine that you blow my mind
Think I'll make you mine, think I'll make you mine

(You got style, you got style,) yeah
(You got style,) baby
You got style, you got style
You got style, (baby)
I think I'll make you mine

I walk down the street, is it you I see?
Finely designed, indeed
My gaze slides down, down

I watch your every move
You glance at me, my heart starts to beat
You paralyse my thoughts and I feel
A hot night is approaching me

Like this, like that, yeah (Like that)
I'm glad I met ya (All right)
What's up? All clear? - Wonderful (Come on , thank you)
How is it? - Like this, like that

Don't you know you look so fine?
Don't you know you blow my mind?
Don't you know that you got style?
I think I'll make you mine

(You got style, you got style,) yeah

You got style, you got style
You got style, (baby)
