Those who experience love

Summer sunshine falling into your room
Bright and warm, embracing you
And the dark view, which clouds your days
Suddenly becomes clear again

Ice turns to fire, when its magic quietly touches you
And all of a sudden your grey day starts to shine
And you hear the melody, full of emotion and full of poetry

Those who experience love, will be immortal
Those who experience love, won't ever be alone
Look for love with every new day

Sometimes it smiles at you
And will stay with you your whole life long
Mmm... sometimes all your happiness lies in just one moment
And you look for the melody, full of emotion and full of poetry

To live for love means you'll never die 
To live for love for all of your life 
You'll see forever's here to stay 

You'll see forever's here to stay 
Forever's here to ѕtаy
