Too Much

The day before marriage, I was out so long in the night
My lovely fiancée no more is feelin' my sight
Why do I feel this way? - Dunno, last night was great
But something's screwin' me up, I swear to God I will stop

Too much, too much, too much, I say
My life - it looks like a cabaret
Too much, too much, too much, enough
I swear I'll never use that stuff

Oo… baby, take me back (Okay)
Oh…. give me one more smile (All right)
You're mine and only one (We'll see)
Why, darling, you don't come?

The day after marriage, I went in the streets with my bride
She wanted coffee - oh no, I'm voting for beer
You see how good is she - my caring, lovely fiancée
We walked into the bar through light
Oh God - there's girls from last night

Too much, too much, too much, I say
My life - it looks like a cabaret
Too much, too much, too much, enough
I swear I'll never use that stuff

Oo… baby, take me back (Okay)
Oh…. give me one more smile (All right)
You're mine and only one (We'll see)
Why, darling, you don't come? (Too much)

Oo… baby, take me back (Okay)
Oh…. give me one more smile (All right)
You're mine and only one (We'll ѕee)
Why, dаrling, you don't come? (Too much)
