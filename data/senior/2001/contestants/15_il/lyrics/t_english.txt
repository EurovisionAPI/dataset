Never mind

If it seems like the entire way was in vain
If it seems like my heart is torn now
There is a kind of song that rises in me and sings
Never mind, never mind, never mind

If it pains you, your two eyes are in tears
If it pains you and there's no sign for what's to come
I will sing to you, caress your head up to your neck
Never mind, never mind, never mind

Because this song consoles hearts
Doesn't give up, it always finds ways
Turns bad into good time and again
And the familiar melody returns
Never mind, never mind, never mind

In front of a wave of joy, the sea of sorrow is large
Light and darkness are fighting over us now
Only the song is still rising, beloved and familiar
Never mind, never mind, never mind

Because this song consoles hearts
Doesn't give up, it always finds ways
Turns bad into good time and again
And the familiar melody returns
Never mind, never mind, never mind

Lalalala… lalalala lala…
Lalalala… lalala…

Because this song consoles hearts
Doesn't give up, it always finds ways
Turns bad into good time and again
And the familiar melody returns
Never mind, never mind, never mind

And the familiar melody returns
Never mind, never mind, never mind

(Lalalala… lalalala lala…)
You'll see, ѕweetheаrt
Never mind
