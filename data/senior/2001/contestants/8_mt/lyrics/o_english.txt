Another Summer Night

The golden sand beneath my feet
There's music in the air
A guitar in my hand
I'm sure you understand all this is magic
No matter where the wind blows
I'll always think of you
Stay with me, young and free
We'll live in perfect harmony

Another summer night down by the ocean
Under the palm trees, you and I
Walking on the beach beneath the moonlight
Just like a dream that never dies
Never dies, never dies

Blue skies all around us
Feels like love is everywhere
Just a smile and our eyes
Will meet so we can feel the fire burning
A taste of heaven's what I need
Can never get enough
Million stars, endless sky
With each moment passing by

Another summer night down by the ocean
(By the ocean)
Under the palm trees, you and I
(Just you and I)
Walking on the beach beneath the moonlight
Just like a dream that never dies
Never dies, never dies
(Like a dream that never dies)

Another summer night down by the ocean
(By the ocean)
Under the palm trees, you and I
(You and I)
Walking on the beach beneath the moonlight
Just like a dream that never dies
Never dies

(Another summer night down by the ocean)
(Just by the ocean)
(Under the palm trees, you and I)
Never dies
(Walking on the beach beneath the moonlight)
(Just like a dream thаt never dies)
Another ѕummer night
