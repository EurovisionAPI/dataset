The end of love

In my every song, every word, in any night of mine without you
You were there, you again, my heart trembles because you're not here
On the long endless roads, in the rain, in my tears
You were there, you again, my heart trembles because you're not here

For the last time look behind
What's left except your sorrow
Please look behind to see what you've left
While my arms are waiting for you, my love is on the roads

It is going mad
Ah, this heart of mine beats always with the pain you brought to me
The one that carries you in it like crazy

So far away, so far apart, lonely am I, my love, tonight 
Longing for all I left behind, precious moments I no longer find 

Love has gone, memories - they fade away 
Nothing more left for me but only to say 
I still love you, please come back, my lonely heart 
Keepѕ calling you back, once again 
I feel that old pain, lonely аm I now, tonight 
Oh…
