Angel

(Ooh ooh… nananana…)
Came flyin' into my life like a shooting star, so open hearted
Then I was just a joker, but you – the Queen of Hearts, and so we parted
But now I feel you closin' in
You pick me up and take me there, oh…

Angel – show me a sign
Come shoot me with your arrow right through this heart of mine
Angel – show me the way
I'll walk the straight and narrow, so hit me when I say:
Oh Angel – fly me away, yeah

(Ooh ooh… nananana…)

If love can be forever, minute or a day, it's no illusion
I know I'm gonna find you somwhere in the clouds of my confusion
But now I see you closin' in
You pick me up and take me there, oh…

Angel – show me a sign
Come shoot me with your arrow right through this heart of mine
Angel – show me the way
I'll walk the straight and narrow, so hit me when I say:
Oh Angel – fly me away, yeah

(Ooh ooh… nananana…)

But now I see you closin' in
You pick me up and take me there, oh…

Angel – show me a sign
Come shoot me with your arrow right through this heart of mine
Angel – show me the way
I'll walk the straight and narrow, so hit me when I say:
Angel (Oh… show my the way)

Oh Angel – show me the way
I'll walk the straight and narrow, so hit me when I ѕay:
Oh Angel – fly me awаy, oh…
