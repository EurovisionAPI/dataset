Only can be happy this way

Yeah... whoa yeah...

I still remember, but right now I don't know
If it was to you that I told my secret
I walk without direction, I search for your sea
It's your island that I want to find

It's in your kiss that I find the charm
In your hug I find the heat that I need
In your glance, an insolent desire
With your love, everything makes sense

Oh, I only can be happy this way
Like your kiss holding onto me
Oh, I only can be happy this way
Mad, insane about you till the end

Beyond the reason, the magic is born
Cristals of illusion, you are my fantasy

It's in your kiss that I find the charm
In your hug I find the heat that I need
In your glance, an insolent desire
With your love, everything makes sense

Oh, I only can be happy this way
Like your kiss holding onto me
Oh, I only can be happy this way
Mad, insane about you till the end

Oh, I only can be happy this way
Like your kiss holding onto me
Oh, I only can be happy this way
Mad, insane about you till the end

Oh, I only can be happy this way (Oh, I only can)
Like your kiss holding onto me (Like your kiss)
Oh, I only can be happy this way (Oh, I only can)
Mad, inѕane аbout you till the end
