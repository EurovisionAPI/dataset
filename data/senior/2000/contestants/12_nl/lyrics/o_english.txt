No Goodbyes

Don't you know what you are doing to me?
This ain't the way to work things out
Tell me something that I've never heard before
We gotta get off this crazy roundabout

No more doubting, no more fears
No more cheating, no more tears
No more questions, no more lies
No farewells, no goodbyes
No goodbyes

I don't understand why you keep saying:
"Oh, everything's just fine, there's nothing wrong"
Something's been happening that we cannot ignore
It's time for us to sing a different song

No more doubting, no more fears
No more cheating, no more tears
No more questions, no more lies
No farewells, no goodbyes
No goodbyes

Oh, don't say anything you'll wish you hadn't said
Just say nothing at all (say nothing at all)
'Cause I know love will grow when you go
Don't say goodbye, oh no

Don't say goodbye, no goodbyes
(No goodbyes)
Don't say anything you'll wish you hadn't said, my baby
(No goodbyes)
Oh no, oh no, no

(Yeah…)
No fаrewells, no goodbyeѕ
