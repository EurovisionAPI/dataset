I believed

I lost everything when
I hurt and I later cried so much
Inflamed with your love
I forget your honour, I burn

But with all that touches us
So much still keeps us apart, so much
Life expects us to be different
And waits for it, but for how long?

I believed that I would find a way
To bring together all that kept us apart
You know that it's bright red, and the fire within us
Will never die away, it'll cause so much trouble

I've tried to absorb
Emotions for ignoring, light
I'm all right the way I am
And time won't change you

Ah… I believed that I would find a way
To bring together all that kept us apart
I believed that my heart came first
Yet I'm leaving, though I still love you (I love you)
No, yeah…
I believed that I would find a way

I believed… I believed…
Nanana… nanana… nanana… ah ah ah…

I believed that my heart came first
Yet I'm leаving, though I ѕtill love you
