The Moon

I knew it all from the start
I knew you'll rise above my world, a little sun warming my heart
I betrayed myself, I knew I lied
You've searched into my soul to find love
And found me hiding deep inside
You did see a way to set me free

Now I hear when the wind is playing with the stars of my night
Simply 'cause I have you near
Now I feel when the moon is playing on and on and on with my heart
Simply 'cause your love is real
Oh…

I knew it all, I understood
I simply blinked and let the light give me reasons to be good
You did see a way to set me free

Now I hear when the wind is playing with the stars of my night
Simply 'cause I have you near
Now I feel when the moon is playing on and on and on with my heart
Simply 'cause your love is real
Oh…

Yes, I feel when the moon is playing
Oh…

Now I hear how the wind is playing with the stars of my night
Simply 'cause I have you near
Now I feel when the moon is playing on and on and on with my heart
Simply 'cause your love iѕ reаl
Oh…
