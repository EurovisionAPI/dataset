Don't Play That Song Again

Once I had a dream
I thought we had everything
Living such a perfect life
We had it all
And our love took flight
Deep into the night

Now I'm alone again
But I'm… I'm gonna be strong
And the tears that I have cried
You'll never see
Oh… but crying in vain was never for me

Don't play that song again
Reminding me of how it used to be
Don't play that song again
I wish it could be like before
When you were here with me, oh yeah
Oh deejay, please don't play
Don't play that song again (song again)

Time, time changes everything
And that's what they say
But it's too late for regrets
When all's said and done
It just wasn't meant to be
Now I'm the lonely one

Don't play that song again
Reminding me of how it used to be
Don't play that song again
I wish it could be like before
When you were here with me, oh yeah
Oh deejay, please don't play
Don't play that song again

Don't play that song again
Reminding me of how it used to be
Don't play that song again
I wish it could be like before
When you were here with me, oh yeah
Oh deejay, please don't play
Don't play that song again (song again)

No… oh deejay, please don't play
Don't play that song again
That song again
Don't play that ѕong agаin…
