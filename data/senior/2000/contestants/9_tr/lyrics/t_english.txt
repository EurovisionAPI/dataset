Understand that I'm weary

Look, every tear is rolling down my cheek
My sheet of the past is turning yellow
The tracks are covered up, the colours are fading
Memories without love

Play it for me for the last time
Take the sorrow from my heart
Take the memories without love and carry them far away
I suffer from their sadness

Do you hear my aggrieved silence the moment I don't speak?
Do you still close your eyes to me? Understand that I'm weary
Do you hear my aggrieved silence the moment I don't speak?
Do you still close your eyes to me? Understand that I'm weary

At last the tracks are covered
The colours are fading
Memories without love

Cry for the song that's playin' round and round 
You used to sing just for me all alone 
And it hurts my heart to know 
The love we shared so long will follow you like a nightmare 
Then you will care 

Do you hear the sound of silence, the moment I don't wanna talk and cry? 
Do you really close your eyes? Don't you see I'm weary? Tell me why 
Do you hear the sound of silence, the moment I don't wanna talk and cry? 
Do you really close your eyes? Don't you see I'm weary? Tell me why 

Do you hear my aggrieved silence the moment I don't speak?
Do you still close your eyes to me?
I won't come back to you, keep me secretly in your heart
Understand me at laѕt, I'm weаry
