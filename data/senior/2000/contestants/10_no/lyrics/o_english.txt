My heart goes boom

Wooh!

Summer, Saturday and sunshine, suddenly, I saw you there
A stunning sight from God knows where
You were standing in the shadows, looking quite impossible
I lost my mind and popsicle

A radio was singing
Something blue in perfect tune
Half a look over your shoulder
I couldn't keep from staring back at you

My heart goes boom when I see you, baby
Don't you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me
Say you're glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon
My heart goes boom

Summer, Saturday, and sunset, you said hello and I said hi
And something lit the evening sky
You came out of the shadows with a teasing twinkle in your eye
And took my senses for a ride

A radio was playing
Something slow in perfect tune
Half a smile as you sat down
I couldn't seem to keep my eyes off you

My heart goes boom when I see you, baby
Don't you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me
Say you're glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon
(My heart goes boom)

A radio was singing
Something blue in perfect tune
Half a look over your shoulder
I couldn't seem to keep my eyes off you

My heart goes…
My heart goes boom when I see you, baby
Don't you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me
Say you're glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon
My heart goes boom

Oh baby, my heаrt goeѕ boom
