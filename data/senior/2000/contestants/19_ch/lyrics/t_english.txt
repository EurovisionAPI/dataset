What is life?

I wake up in the morning
The coffee I made yesterday is still hot
The rain over the window
Is reading my thoughts

I wonder where my absent love is
The telephone has not rung
Your smile makes me crazy
I can't wait anymore

I know it was not easy, my fragile heart
Is burning in a moment and flies straight with the wind
I feel like a little seawave, the blueness of love
Now you are in my days

Where is life? What is life?
A thorn which hurts my heart
If you are not here

Where is life? What is life?
A balcony of love with no applause
If you are not here

Divide the world with me, make me live every day
To shine like the light of a star
To live love in the sky, is such a beautiful thing
Hold me strongly, kiss me

Where is life? What is life?
A thorn which hurts my heart
If you are not here

Where is life? What is life?
A balcony of love with no applauѕe
If you are not here

If you аre not here
