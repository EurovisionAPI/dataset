100% I love you

One hundred percent I love you, one hundred percent I do
And I have no intention of losing hope
One hundred percent I love you, one hundred percent I do
And I'll tell you again that I'm persistent

One hundred percent I love you, one hundred percent I do
And I have no intention of losing hope
One hundred percent I love you, one hundred percent I do
And I'll tell you again that I'm persistent

He's as sweet as chocolate, he's sweet, so sweet, I swear
And when he looks at you, is it coincidentally?
Tonight I'll get him, I'll whisper in his ear
To remind him

No, don't forget, on the wall by your bed
To cut my photo from a magazine and frame it
And don't forget to dream of me tonight

One hundred percent I love you, one hundred percent I do
And I have no intention of losing hope
One hundred percent I love you, one hundred percent I do
And I'll tell you again that I'm persistent

One hundred percent I love you, one hundred percent I do
And I have no intention of losing hope
One hundred percent I love you, one hundred percent I do
And I'll tell you again that I'm persistent

Ooh lalala lalalala…
Ooh lalala…
Ooh lalala…

No, don't forget, on the wall by your bed
To cut my photo from a magazine and frame it
And don't forget to dream of me tonight

One hundred percent I love you, one hundred percent I do
And I have no intention of losing hope
One hundred percent I love you, one hundred percent I do
And I'll tell you again that I'm persistent

I love you one hundred percent, yes, I do 
And I often wonder if you would love me too 
I love you one hundred percent, yes, I do 
And I'll make you see that this heart of mine is true 
And I'll make you see that this heаrt of mine is true 

I love you one hundred percent, yeѕ, I do
