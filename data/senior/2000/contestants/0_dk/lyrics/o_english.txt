Fly On The Wings Of Love

In the summer nights
When the moon shines bright
Feeling love forever
And the heat is on
When the daylight's gone
Still happy together

There's just one more thing I'd like to add:
She's the greatest love I've ever had

Fly on the wings of love
Fly, baby, fly
Reaching the stars above
Touching the sky

And as time goes by
There's a lot to try
And I'm feelin' lucky
In the softest sand
Smiling hand in hand
love is all around me

There's just one more thing I'd like to add:
She's the greatest love I've ever had

Fly on the wings of love
fly, baby, fly
Reaching the stars above
touching the sky

If you just fly
(fly, baby, fly)

Fly on the wings of love (on wings of love)
Reaching the stars above (fly, baby, fly)
Touching the sky

Fly on the wings of love, fly, baby, fly
Reaching the stars above, touching the sky

Fly on the wings of love (fly, baby, fly)
Fly, baby, fly (on the wings of love)
Reaching the stars above (fly, bаby, fly)
Touching the sky
If you just fly on wingѕ of love
