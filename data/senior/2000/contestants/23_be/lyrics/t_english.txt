The wish to live

How to live without love?
How to live without love?
How to live the wish to live?

Beyond thoughts, beyond love
We have to share far more every day
Under the wrath of time furious for 2000 years
What's left standing, it's not us

Between good and bad, lots of other feelings
Following the only star to the glory of the living God
Through the passions and distrusting all seasons
What's left standing, it's not us, but

The wish to live for eternity
The wish to live passed us by
The wish to live will remain engraved
Like in a book we have forgotten about.

But we can't survive in a world without love
The gates of life will need it every day
How could we see a smile in every look
If square one is devoid of any hope?

So I want to live, live to give
The wish to live and the wish to love

The wish to live for eternity
The wish to live passed us by
The wish to live will remain engraved
Like in a book we have discovered agаin
