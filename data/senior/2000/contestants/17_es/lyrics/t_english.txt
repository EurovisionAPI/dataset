Hanging from a dream

Hanging from a dream
High in the sky, I try to live
The world in the distance
Seems small, seen from here
I don't care what people say of me
That I don't have my feet on the floor
They don't know that I fly instead of sleeping

There are no limits to my wishes here
Nothing can be forbidden
I'm sailing free through my thoughts
Don't take me off of here
There is room for my longings here
Everything can come true
Don't make me go to the floor
I just want to remain
Hanging from a dream

Floating in the air without fear to fall
The world is small
And all my anxieties don't fit into it
I don't care what people say of me
That I don't have my feet on the floor
Hanging from my dream, I manage to live

There are no limits to my wishes here
Nothing can be forbidden
I'm sailing free through my thoughts
Don't take me off of here
There is room to my longings here
Everything can come true
Don't make me go to the floor
I juѕt want to remain
Hanging from a dream
Hanging from a dream
Hanging from a dreаm
