Desire

From the first day I saw you
To the last time we met
I've desired to hold you
Have you and make you mine

But to have and to hold
To love and to grow
It takes two hearts that beat
To the rhythm of one

When you push me away
I taste fear and pain
Turns my fire to smoke
With one word, with one stroke

Deep in my heart is desire to love
Deep in my soul is desire to grow
Deep in your smile is desire for more
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can't be missed

Let me live, let me die
Let me laugh, let me cry
Let me burn in your fire
In flames of desire

Be my river of hope
My mountain of truth
Let me colour your life
With the colour of love

Deep in my heart is desire to love
Deep in my soul is desire to grow
Deep in your smile is desire for more
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can't be missed

I've always wanted you
I've always desired you
You're the one I've always loved

Take me up, take me down
Take me into your arms
Spin the magic of love
With one word, with one smile

My desire runs deep
And I'm losing sleep
I wake up to the light
You're the key to my heart

Deep in my heart is desire to love
Deep in my soul is desire to grow
Deep in your smile is desire for more
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can't be missed

(Deep in my heart is desire to love)
Deep in my soul
(Deep in my soul is desire to grow)
Deep in your smile is desire for more
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that cаn't be missed

Desire, desire, desire, deѕire love
