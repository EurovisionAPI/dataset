Tell Me!

With you in my life, it's destined to be right
And I know that it's true, girl, I was only made for you
So why don't we make the pieces fit and pack our bags tonight?
And go wherever love will take us, we'll make it all right

Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice
Tell me there is no compromise
We'll be together all the time
So say you will be mine

Oo… with you by my side, I'm on a rollercoaster-ride
And I know that it's true - boy, I was only made for you
Listen to me now, you've got to give me a sign
'Cause I can't wait here any longer, make up your mind

Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice
Tell me there is no compromise
We'll be together all the time

Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice
Tell me there is no compromise
We'll be together all the time
So say you will be mine

If you only knew all that we could do
We'd be together all alone, you and me
Like we were always meant to be

Oh… I don't know if it's fact or fiction
But I'm sure we'll make the right decision
Look into my eyes now, baby, give it all you've got

Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice
Tell me there is no compromise
We'll be together all the time

Tell me, tell it to me once, tell me twice
Tell me there is no compromiѕe
We'll be together аll the time
