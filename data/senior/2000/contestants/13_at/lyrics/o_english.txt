All To You

I never was the one to carry on
But everything is different since you came along
In the middle of something special, I never felt this way before
Now I need a little time to understand a little more

I can't explain the way you made me feel (Made me feel)
Or the moment that my heart began to reel (Reel)
You took me in a new direction, you're showin' me a different way (Different way)
Now I'm in a situation, I will be the one to say

Why don't you take me, my baby
Hold me for all time and never leave me, believe me
Let me be your one and only
Love me like you do and let me give my lovin' all to you
Oh yeah…

Now I know it's love, and that's a fact (That's a fact)
No return, there is no goin' back (No, no, no, no)
It might be the way you make me crazy, you always take my breath away
And now there's only one thing, baby, that there's left for me to say

Why don't you take me, my baby
Hold me for all time and never leave me, believe me
I will always be by your side
Always on my mind, my baby, take me

And everything I feel is from the bottom of my heart (Yeah…)
I'll give you everything I have, I'll give you what you never had

Why don't you take me, my baby
Hold me for all time and never leave me, believe me
I will always be by your side
Always on my mind, you take what's wrong and make it right

I really need you, to feel you
Wrap me in your arms, surround me sweetly, completely
Let me be your one and only
Love me like you do, juѕt let me give my lovin' all to you

Let me give my lovin' аll to you
