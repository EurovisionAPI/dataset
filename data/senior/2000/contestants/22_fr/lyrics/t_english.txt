We'll have the sky

And in your eyes, my eyes, to dive, to cross the ocean
To finally put my hand on you
And in your arms, my arms, to fall, taken by the impulse
To finally let my fingers slide

We'll have the sky
A little bit like angels, wings, we're flying away, you and I
We'll have the honey
A taste of orange, cinnamon, we're flying away, you and I

And on your skin, my salty skin, to savour the moments
At night, to finally laze a little bit on you, my baby
And in your heart, my heart, to shine, to put down a diamond
At night, to finally think a little bit of me

We'll have the sky
A little bit like angels, wings, we're flying away, you and I
We'll have the honey
A taste of orange, cinnamon, we're flying away, you and I

Oh… to play with clouds under the blue sky, my baby
To play with clouds under the blue sky
We'll have the sun deeply in our eyes, my baby
We'll have the sun deeply in our eyes

And on your heart, my heart, light, taken by the wind
Oh… you and I

We'll have the sky
A little bit like angels, wings, we're flying away, you and I
We'll have the honey
A taste of orange, cinnamon, we're flying away, you and I

We'll have the sky
(And on your skin, my salty skin, to savour the moments)
We're flying away, you and I
We'll have the sky
(And on your heart, my heart, to shine, to put down a diamond)
We're flying away, you and I

We'll have the sky
A little bit like angels, wings, we're flying away, you and I
We'll have the honey
A taste of orange, cinnamon, we're flying away, you and I

We'll hаve the ѕky
