When the angels fall asleep

Kiss me and be here
Let me shut my eyes on your warm shoulder
Kiss me and be here
Let the heart beat like the first time
Kiss me, pray
May all the world's candles burn for us

Stay tonight, when everyone threatens me
Stay, embrace me like a child
Stay, when all my love is you
Stay, to hold me when the angels fall asleep

Kiss me and be here
Let the heart beat like the first time
Kiss me, pray
May all the world's candles burn for us

Stay tonight, when everyone threatens me
Stay, embrace me like a child
Stay, when all my love is you

Stay tonight, when everyone threatens me
Stay, embrace me like a child
Stay, when all my love is you
Stay, to hold me when angels fall аѕleep
