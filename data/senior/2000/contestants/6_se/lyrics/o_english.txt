When Spirits Are Calling My Name

I am caught in a trap, there is no turning back, I'm finally facin' the fear
The sky is on fire, and up with the flames, my hope and my dreams disappear
So bring me the power, I'll be the king of the land and the seas
Show me the way to go, let me fight with my body and soul

Let me be the native son with freedom in my heart
Life will never be the same when spirits are calling my name
My name…

Let me out of the darkness, the shadow of pain, and I'm keepin' my promise to you
My people, my spirit, the home of my heart - you're with me wherever I go
So bring me the power, I'll be the king of the land and the seas
I've got a way to go, let me fight with my body and soul

Let me be the native son with freedom in my heart
Life will never be the same when spirits are calling my name
My name…

So bring me the power, I'll be the king of the land and the seas
I've got a way to go, let me fight with my body and soul

Let me be the native son with freedom in my home
Life will never be the same when spirits are calling my name

Spiritѕ are calling my nаme
