When the Winds Whisper My Name

I was caught in the darkness, I couldn't see the light
Though everything was engulfed in flames
All my hope and faith was trapped therewithin
It had now gone up in smoke

Give me the power to defend my country
Give me a way to go

I'll never let my country down when the winds whisper my name

The falling rain concealed my sorrows
And quenched my aching thirst
Fled to the mountains at dawn
When I suddenly heard a voice

I hear how the winds whisper, calling my name
I've got a way to go
I see the axe-wielding warrior

Do you want me to turn back to fight for my life?
I'll never let my country down when the winds whisper my name

The winds whiѕper my nаme
