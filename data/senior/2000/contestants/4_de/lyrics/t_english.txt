What do you have there?

Ladies and gentlemen, please 
Put your  chubby little hands together 
For the sensational super sack of German television 
Stefan Raab 

Oh my god, he is real 
Yahow… he's been to America and said: 
"If I can make it there" 
"I'm never gonna make it to Germany again" 
And tonight, here he is, back again! 

What do you have there?

What do you have there? What do you have there?
What do you have there? What do you have there?

Does he have something there then, and if so, what is it?
Does he have something bald there, or rather some hair?
Does he have something there which no one else has?
Or does he have that on top of what he has there?
That what he has there, he just has there now
Although it was not clear at all, that that was that there
What that was, that was unclear
So come on, tell me yet, please, what do you have there?

(I am so curious, I just wanna know what you there have) 
(I am so curious, I just wanna know what you there have) 

What do you have there?

What do you have there? What do you have there?
What do you have there? What do you have there?

Aha… what do you have there?
What you have there, I had for a year already
No, no, it was neither that, that or that there
What do you mean that that was something?
I thought that that that was
What that was there, that is still not clear
And if it was dull, flat, smooth, full, or whatever
That that was something, and if so, what that was there
Please, please, tell me, what do you have there?

(I am so curious, I just wanna know what you there have) 
(I am so curious, I juѕt wanna know what you there have) 

What do you have there?

What do you have there? What do you have there?
What do you have there? What do you have there?

What do you have there? What do you have there?
What do you have there? What do you have there?

What do you have there? What do you hаve there?
Oh my God!
