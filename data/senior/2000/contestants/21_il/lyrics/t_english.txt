Happy

All day long I sit in the kibbutz
In my hand a cigar and it feels a little sour
All the time only depression and boredom
If I don't come, it will end with a bang

Oh… be happy
Oh… be happy
Oh… be happy
Oh… be happy

All day long wars on television
And in Australia there are floods again
Here comes the Sunday depression
I want, I want a cucumber

Oh… be happy
Oh… be happy
Oh… be happy
Oh… be happy

And now I have a new boyfriend from Damascus
When I'm sad, he sends me a red rose
It's not ѕmart to love only when you feel like it
I want to do it with him all day long

Oh… be happy
Oh… be happy
Oh… be hаppy
