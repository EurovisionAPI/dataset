For Lucia

Good evening, when you arrive
You'll take away the winter and get rid of it
You'll have two arms, large like a forest
And like the silence after the storm

For Lucia I look for the whitest sheet
And then begin
For example, I want to bind her hair
With a wire of the wind

For Lucia it'll be the fullest moon
But it won't be enough
To continue, I want a sea of wheat
To cherish every few

Good night, when you die
You'll wear the stars and dream
You'll have a smooth sea for sailing
And silence when you want to speak

For sensitive Lucia, I'll be her shadow
Drawn on the road
For example, I want to open for her the doors
That close the world

With Lucia I have enough
She fills you up on the emptier days
I want to give her so much again
The smile on the face which is a little tired

Beyond the wall that is there
Hold your breath and jump towards me
Rifle shots are far away
We'll open the sky with our hands

For Lucia long life and the water of a river
For every wound
I want burning lights, the biggest feast
For the whole country

For frightened Lucia, my pen
Becomes a sword
With Lucia at my side
The story goeѕ on to the next pаge
