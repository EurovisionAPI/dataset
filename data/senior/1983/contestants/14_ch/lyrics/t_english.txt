I don't like it this way

In that way I don't like, I don't like it
Doing for love or not
An affair leaves a sign
A woman always loses something
Falling in love doesn't make sense
You always stay with her

Even for fun, to spend an evening
To fight boredom
I don't like it this way
If it's only to make love
One time and never again, for a rushed act
Without any emotion
No feeling, nothing in here
I don't like it this way

And then who will be, which of the two of us
Will be doubtful in their heart
It will be me, it will be me not you
Instead as if nothing had happened
You'll return to her this evening

Even for fun, to spend an evening
To fight boredom
I don't like it this way
If it's only to make love
One time and never again, for a rushed act
I don't like it this way

If it's only to make love
One time and never again, for a rushed act
Without any emotion
No feeling, nothing in here
I don't like it thiѕ wаy
