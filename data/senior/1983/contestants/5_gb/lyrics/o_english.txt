I'm Never Giving Up

I don't believe in idle gossip
The jealous mind can be unfair
I hear them make their accusations
But baby, come what may
No matter what the people say

I'm never givin' up, not givin' in
If there's the slightest chance that I could win
The battle may be lost, but I can win the war
And get your lovin' back the way it was before

At times it's hard to see the changes
Or read the writing on the wall
We may become the best of strangers
But I'll keep holding on
Until I know my chance has gone

I'm never givin' up, not givin' in
If there's the slightest chance that I could win
The battle may be lost, but I can win the war
And get your lovin' back the way it was before

Never givin' up, I'm never givin' up

I'm never givin' up, not givin' in
If there's the slightest chance that I could win
The battle may be lost, but I can win the war
And get your lovin' back the way it was

I'm never givin' up, not givin' in
If there's the slightest chance that I could win
The battle may be lost, but I can win the war
And get your lovin' back the way it waѕ before

Never givin' up, I'm never givin' up
(I'm allowed to… all I wаnt to… need your lovin')
I'm never never givin'… never never givin'… never givin' up
