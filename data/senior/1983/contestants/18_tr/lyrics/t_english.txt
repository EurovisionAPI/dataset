Opera

That's opera, storm of excitement
I feel it so strongly, this love should never end

Ballet, with music full of love
Overture, trio, duet, choirs
The Abduction from the Seraglio, La Traviata will not die

Opera, opera, opera, opera, opera
Opera, opera, opera, opera, Carmen, Aida
Opera, opera, tonight at the opera they play
Tosca, Figaro and Fidelio, exciting arias

Lay lay la lay lay lay la lay la lay…
(Opera, opera, opera, opera, opera)
Lay lay la lay lay lay la lay la lay…
(Opera, opera, opera, opera), Carmen, Aida
Opera, opera, tonight at the opera they play
Tosca, Figaro and Fidelio, exciting arias

This is opera, Wagner and Puccini
Mozart, Rossini, the works of Verdi will remain forever

Ballet, with music full of love
Overture, trio, duet, choirѕ
The Abduction from the Seraglio, La Traviatа will not die
Will never die
