Sing Me a Song

Sing me a song
Such a little chanson
Blues, ballad or folk
Children's songs are allowed too
And then let the people of all countries sing

Sing me a song
Sing me a song
What the world is all about is music
And music makes understanding

Sing me a sang
(Sing sing sing me a song song)
(Sing a chanson son)
Sing a chanson
(Sing me a song song)
(Come on and sing it)
About your country
(About countries)
How it is there and what do you do over there?

Such a little chanson
Brown, white or black
It comes from the same heart
