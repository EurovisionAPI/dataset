Fantasy

Who is he and what is the language that he speaks?
Who is he? I wish that he would come close to me
What is he? He spends the days walking his dog
Who is he and where does he disappear to?

Is this a fantasy or the beginning of a crush?
He strokes the dog and I watch jealously
There's no sound in the park, I don't see anyone
Is this just a daydream or my imagination?

Is this a fantasy or just a sad story?
He gets into a black car and I'm left alone again
When I see the stop lights I hope in silence again
That he finally had noticed a woman in love

(Time goes by, cheeks will dry)
(Everything you touch turns to rust)
(Tomorrow is a sound of yesterday)

Who is he and what brings him again to this park?
What is the reason he gives tenderness to his pet?
Who is he? I may never find this out
What is this? Is this just a dream?

Is this a fantasy or the beginning of a crush?

Is this a fantasy or just a sad story?
He gets into a black car and I'm left alone again
When I see the stop lights I hope in ѕilence again
That he finally had noticed a woman…
Finally noticed a womаn in love
