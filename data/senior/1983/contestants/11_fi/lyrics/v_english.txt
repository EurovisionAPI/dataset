Fantasy Dream

Who could he be?
And if he talked to me, would I understand?
Who could he be?
Is there a chance he feels the same about me?
What kind of man
He takes his dog out everyday to the park
What kind of man
And then disappears in the dark?

Is this a fantasy dream, or am I falling in love?
And I just stare with empty eyes as he is stroking his dog
I feel like shouting his name, but I don′t know who he is
And then I'm all alone and wonder, does he really exist?

Is this a fantasy dream? I see his face everywhere
I see him running for a taxi, but the taxi′s not there
I see him calling a name, but I can't hear any word
Am I a woman who loves someone from a fantasy world?

(Time, they say, will wait for no one)
(Is he real or just an omen?)
(Only echoes of another life)

Who could he be?
What reason brings him to the park every day?
Who could he be?
And if he called me, would I know what to say?
What kind of man?
His dog – his only true companion – he feels
What kind of man?
Is he the one? Is he real?
