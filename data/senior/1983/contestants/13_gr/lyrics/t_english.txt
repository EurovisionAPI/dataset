You tell me

You tell me about seas and ships, and my heart like a bird
In your bosom hushes, and wherever you go, it follows you
In your bosom hushes, and wherever you go, it follows you
I'll close all the ports, and the stations so that you won't be lost from me
Your mind I'll imprison, so that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer
Your mind I'll imprison, so that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer

You tell me about trains that keep leaving, and gypsies that move
And I read your eyes, to see where they run, where they wander
And I read your eyes, to see where they run, where they wander

I'll close all the ports, and the stations so that you won't be lost from me
Your mind I'll imprison, so that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer
Your mind I'll imprison, so that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer

I'll close all the ports, and the stations so that you won't be lost from me
Your mind I'll imprison, so that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer
Your mind I'll imprison, so that you cease feeling noѕtalgia аny longer
