Living

Living, living a day again, living a love again
Living an awakening again, drunk, filled with sun
Love, love like a fool, love, love on your knees
Yes, even if you have to suffer, love, even if you have to leave

They said goodbye to each other, maybe till never
But deep in their eyes, oh, how much they loved each other
And the dance of the days will take them away
To another forever, to eternity
Far, far, so far away, like a star, a dot

Living, living a day again, living a love again
Living an awakening again, drunk, filled with the sun
Love, love like a fool, love, love on your knees
Yes, even if you have to suffer, love, even if you have to leave

What do the seasons matter, what does the weather matter?
Beyond the horizon, nothing is important
They pass through the night deep in their eyes
A shimmering flame, love as farewells
Far, far, so far away, like a star, a dot

At sunrise, they took it away
The guns of the killers will soon ring
You've got to die in the end, they say, what do you want?
Then he started to smile, he answered
Far, far, so far away, like a star, a dot

Living, living a day again
Living a love again
Living (an awakening agаin)
Oh, living (filled with the ѕun)
Living, living
