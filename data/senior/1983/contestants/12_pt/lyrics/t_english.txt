This ballad that I give you

She says I was a very serious case
But only I know that there's something abnormal to that
There was a time, a look, a smile, a beginning
But now everything has lost its glow

In my life there was only one hug like yours
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal
It's pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you
It's pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you

You might even think that I'm a bit sad
But there's nothing wrong with being this way
For when everything is over
A romance, a passionate amour or a way

In my life there was only one hug like yours
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal
It's pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you
It's pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you

I wanted to write the most beautiful song in the world
Looking back to see ourselves
It was when I heard a bass voice singing
This ballad which came from far away

In my life there was only one hug like yours
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal

In my life there was only one hug like yours
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal
It's pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you
It's pretty, pretty, thiѕ ballad thаt I give you
