Love is still alive

I wish I could establish a big choir
And write a song for it with a nice melody
I wish our children could learn it
And sing it all over the world
And that it would be a song for everyone
And would say together

Love is still alive, love is still alive
Love is still alive, love is still alive
Love is still alive, albeit without a sunny day
Love is still alive, I feel it in the air tonight

I wish I could establish a big choir
And write a song for it with a nice melody
I wish our children could learn it
And make music with it
And the peoples of the earth
Could sing together

Love is still alive, love is still alive
Love is still alive, love is still alive
Love is still alive, albeit without a sunny day
Love is still alive, I feel it in the air tonight

Love is still alive, love is still alive
Love is still alive, love is ѕtill аlive
