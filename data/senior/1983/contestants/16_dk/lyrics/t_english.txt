The planet's spinning

The planet's spinning, everything grows again
People meet, floating on a cloud

A rough sea in the mind of the soul
An S.O.S. that makes me so blind
Perhaps we could, between us
Break the ties
Do let me in

The planet's spinning, everything grows again
People meet, floating on a cloud

A shooting star leads the way
For people like you and me
A light is lit, and the night sees
Once again, to laughing people

The planet's spinning, everything grows again
People meet, floating on a cloud

A thousand stars show the way
The twinkle just for you and me
You and me

The planet's spinning, everything grows again
People meet, floating on a cloud

The planet's spinning, everything growѕ again
People meet, floating on a cloud
Floating on а cloud
