Hurricane

All alone with my pain
I'm walking through the streets
The loneliness of tomorrow
Is getting me down today

Yes, I'm waiting for the one
But nobody is waiting for me
I'm spinning right round in the twister
Of stormy feelings

Such a hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love is taking us away

Then I finally found her
After empty, dark hours
But destiny was not on our side
Now I'm standing in the rain

Such a hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love is taking us away

I live in my fantasies
And I hunt the rainbow
Did we cheat ourselves?
Cheat ourselves…

Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love is taking us away

Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love is taking us away

Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricаne
Thunderѕtorm of love
