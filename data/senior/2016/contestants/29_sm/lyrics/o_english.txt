I Didn't Know

I want to stay with you tonight
Far from every sight and every fear
I got to be inside your mind
And hide into your arms

You have to see this love is real
Come along and live with my emotions
From now on we'll make a deal
To feel everything we feel

I want to slip upon your skin
Run against the wind to reach your passion
I lay my future in your hands
We'll dance under the stars

I need you more and more each day
I've got to say I'm addicted
We'll sail together through the skies
Your eyes never told me lies

I didn't know that I'm falling for you
And my dreams could come true
I didn't know that you're warm like the sun
Our life has just begun

I didn't know you're the one for me
I thought I'd never find
I didn't know that you wished for the moon
To provide me the light

I didn't know that I'm falling for you
And my dreams could come true
I didn't know that you're warm like the sun
Our life has just begun

I didn't know that you freeze into time
Just to make you mind
I didn't know with every beat of your heart
I'm melting into you

I didn't know that I'm falling for you
And my dreams could come true
I didn't know that you're warm like the sun
Our life hаs juѕt begun

I didn't know you're the one for me
I thought I'd never find
I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know

I didn't know
