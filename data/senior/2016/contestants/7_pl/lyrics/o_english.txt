Color of Your Life

When loneliness is knocking on your door
Everything you loved just disappears 
And when you feel that everything is lost 
You need to know
There's no life without tears 

Oh oh oh
Tell me black or white 
What color is your life 
Oh oh oh
Try to ask your heart
Who you really are 

No one is forever beautiful and young
Everything you know just disappears
Fame and gold are nothing you can be sure
When there is no love in your heart 
The choice is yours who you really want to be
Don't be afraid of your destiny
So when you feel that everything is lost
You need to know there's no life without fear 

Oh oh oh
Tell me black or white 
What color is your life 
Oh oh oh
Try to ask your heart
Who you really are 

Every day we must fight with the wind 
We have to live 
All these things are just empty desire 
'Cause there's no smoke without fire 

Oh oh oh
Tell me black or white 
What color is your life 
Oh oh oh
Try to ask your heart
Who you really are 

Oh oh oh
Try to ask your heart
Whаt color iѕ your life
