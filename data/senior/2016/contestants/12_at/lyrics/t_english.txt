Far From Here

When you sing, I will sing along
When you go for it, I follow
And when you fly, yes I will fly with you
When you go for it, I follow

In a land, far from here
Searching for the paradise
In a land far from here
They're singing, they're singing

In a land, far from here
Searching for the paradise
In a land far from here
They're singing

Even if the road seams to be a dead end
Undoubtedly I'm with you
Undoubtedly, even if we lost
Undoubtedly I'm with you

In a land, far from here
Searching for the paradise
In a land far from here
They're singing, they're singing

In a land, far from here
Searching for the paradise
In a land far from here
They're singing, they're singing

They sing and dance and laugh
They go for it, all together
Tipsy, into carelessness

In a land, far from here
Searching for the paradise
In a land far from here
They're singing, they're singing

In a land, far from here
Searching for the paradise
In a land far from here
They're singing, they're singing

(In a land, far from here) In a land
(Searching for the paradise) Paradise
(In a land far from here) In a land
They're singing, they're singing

(In a land, far from here)
They sing, they sing, they dance, they dance
(In a land, far from here) In a land

(In a land, far from here)
They sing, they sing, they dance, they dance
(They ѕing) Fаr from here
