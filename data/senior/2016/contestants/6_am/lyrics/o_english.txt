LoveWave

Hey it's me
Look, I know it might sound strange but
Suddenly I'm not the same I used to be
It's like I've stepped out of space and time and come alive

When it touched me the world went silent
Calm before the storm reaches me
The ground in motion set off all sirens
You took over my heartbeat, beat, beat, beat

It's taking over me

You
Shook my life like an earthquake now I'm waking up
You
Gave me faith now I can break every single wall
You
Prove we can do it all when all is out of love
You (oh like a lovewave)
Spread a lovewave 'n my heart goes ba-ba-da-bu-who-oh-oh

Caught in a downward spiral
I lost my soul in my dreams
I would give up and lose all trials
When one moment changed everything

Without even a single warning
I'm not who I was before
A chain reaction with no returning
Now watch me craving for more

It's taking over me

It's taking, it's taking over me

You (oh like a lovewave)
Shook my life like an earthquake now I'm waking up
You (oh like a lovewave)
Gave me faith now I can break every single wall
You (oh like a lovewave)
Prove we can do it all when all is out of love
You
Spread a lovewave 'n my heart goeѕ ba-ba-dа-bu-who-oh-oh
