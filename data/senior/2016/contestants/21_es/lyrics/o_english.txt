Say Yay!

Hello, hello Mr fighter
Look, there we go again
Go-getters don't forsake
They never wallow in their fate

More than a thousand miles until the end
We're never gonna know what lies ahead
We only got today
To learn from our yesterday

I feel alive (bringing into play)
My whole life (going all the way)
I'm still alive (and I turn away)
From broken mirrors
I feel alive (when I dare to say)
I wanna fight
Won't fix by running, running, running

(Say yay yay yay)
Come on and raise your battle cry
You are the one who never dies
Hurray sing it lalalala Go on singing lalalala
You keep on climbing over hills
Right now you're following your dreams
Hurray sing it lalalala Hurray

(Say yay yay yay)
Hurray
(Say yay yay yay)
(Say yay yay yay)
Hurray
(Say yay yay yay)

Hello, hello Mr Danger
No need to be afraid
I know by heart my shades
I got the light between my breaks

More than a thousand wounds upon my hands
Of every time I fought them face to face
We go through our mistakes
To find the way to go back straight

I feel alive (bringing into play)
My whole life (going all the way)
I'm still alive (and I turn away)
From broken mirrors
I feel alive (when I dare to say)
I wanna fight
Won't fix by running, no no no, won't fix by running

Come on and raise your battle cry
You are the one who never dies
(Hurray sing it lalalala Go on singing lalalala)
You keep on climbing over hills
Right now you're following your dreams
(Hurray sing it lalalala)
Hurray

(Say yay yay yay)
Hurray
(Say yay yay yay)
(Say yay yay yay)
Hurray
(Say yay yay yay)
Say yay yay yay
Hurray
You gotta say yay
Do, do, do, do, do…
Do, do, do, do, do…
Hurray
You gotta say yay
Raiѕe up your battle cry

Say yay yay yаy
