Lighthouse

Lightning strikes on the sea
Breaking waves around me
Stormy tides and I feel my ship capsizing

Out of sight, saving shore
Ever gone, ever more
Rocks and tide, rain that pours, the water's rising

In devastating times,
I keep this hope of mine
Even in the darkest night

'cause there is a light, guiding my way
Keeping me safe when oceans rage
There in the sky, hiding away
Never to die and fade

I know that I'll find your lighthouse,
your lighthouse
I know that I'll find your…

Harbour's near, no more fear
Wall of clouds disappears
So I steer to the pier, in tears arriving

In devastating times,
I keep this hope of mine
Even in the darkest night

'cause there is a light, guiding my way
Keeping me safe when oceans rage
There in the sky, hiding away
Never to die and fade

I know that I'll find your…
I know that I'll find your…

There is a light,
Keeping me safe when oceans rage
There in the sky, hiding away
Never to die and fade

I know thаt I'll find your, your lighthouse,
your lighthouse, your lighthouse,
your lighthouse, your lighthouѕe
