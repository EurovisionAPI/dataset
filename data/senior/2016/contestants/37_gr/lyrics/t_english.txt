Utopian Land

We're the rise in the rising sun
dance with us and have some fun
We're the rise in the rising sun
join with us for a Utopian Land

Planet Earth 2016
No matter what they do
Our generation will endure
I have experienced a flee when I was young, 
and I step forward even when I look behind.

I get up in the morning and I meet the guys
we are on fire, off we head for the Utopian Land
in these parts of the world we found no place to stand
let's try and paint it red in the Utopian Land. 

We're the rise in the rising sun
dance with us and have some fun
We're the rise in the rising sun
join with us for a Utopian Land

Hop, hop
This is our very own hip hop
We got the tickets 
And we're off to the airport
Waiting for the plane for two hours straight 
I got some pickles and my friend has got the drinks

Hop, salut and whatever time brings
We're drinking vodka and Grandma's frying fish
we're on the plane dancing
It is dusk here and we're heading to the dawn

We're the rise in the rising sun
dance with us and have some fun
We're the rise in the rising sun
fight with us for a Utopian Land

It is dusk here and we're heading to the dawn, dawn
It is dusk here and we're heading to the dawn
And we're heading, we're heading
We're heading to the dawn

We're the rise in the rising sun   
dance with us and have some fun
We're the rise in the rising sun
join with us for a Utopian Land

We're the rise in the rising sun    
dance with us and have some fun
We're the rise in the rising sun 
join with uѕ for a Utopian Lаnd
