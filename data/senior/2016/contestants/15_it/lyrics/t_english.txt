No Degree of Separation

It's the first time it's happened to me
Before, I just used to shut myself in
Keeping my distance from life and its stuff
Because I'd never felt it so deep down
And then I felt an emotion flare up quickly
And push its way into my heart without turning down its voice
And I feel no tension, only life inside me 

No degree of separation
No kind of hesitation
There's no division keeping us apart
We are going the same direction in this universe on the move
There's no degree of separation

I had less time for my heart and more for my mind
Always one step behind and my soul on high alert
and I watched the world from a door
never completely open, from a distance
and no, there's no hesitation now inside me

There is no degree of separation 
There is no degree of hesitation
There is no degree of space between us
live in love
We are stars aligned together
dancing through the sky, we are shining

No degree of separation

No degree of separation
in this universe on the move

And then I felt an emotion flare up quickly
And push its way into my heаrt without turning down itѕ voice
