1944

When strangers are coming
They come to your house
They kill you all and say
We're not guilty, not guilty

Where is your mind? Humanity cries
You think you are gods but everyone dies
Don't swallow my soul
Our souls

I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace
I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace

We could build a future
Where people are free
To live and love
The happiest time, our time

Where is your heart? Humanity rise
You think you are gods but everyone dies
Don't swallow my soul
Our souls

I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace
I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace

I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace
I couldn't ѕpend my youth there
I couldn't have my homelаnd
