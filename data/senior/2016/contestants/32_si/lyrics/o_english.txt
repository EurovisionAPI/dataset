Blue and Red

Blue and red
Like I'm watching you and me
Every little thing you said
Led me to fall in love with you

Then you tried to fix me and I wasn't strong
But you were not a composer, I am not your song
Strange chords, different words

How can I mix red and blue together?
Beautiful things in stormy weather

Alive, alive, alive
'Cause blue is blue and red is red
Our past is fading in my head
Now the colour doesn't matter
You feel blue and and I am better

Now I'm changed
Now I'm stronger than before
You're never touching me no more
I'm okay, I'll find my way

How can I mix red and blue together?
Beautiful things in stormy weather

Alive, alive, alive
'Cause blue is blue and red is red
Our past is fading in my head
Now the colour doesn't matter
You feel blue and and I am better

(Blue is blue and red is red)
(Now the colour doesn't matter)

Alive, alive, alive
(Beautiful things in ѕtormy weather)
Alive, alive, аlive
