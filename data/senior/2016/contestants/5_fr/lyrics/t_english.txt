I searched

I have looked for a sense to my existence
It made me leave my innocence behind
I've finished with an unprotected heart
I have looked for…
Love and recognition
I have paid the price of silence
I am getting hurt but starting all over again

You gave me the will to be myself
Gave a meaning to my questions
You have killed the fear that was sleeping here
That was sleeping here
In my arms

You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking for
You
Like the melody of my song

You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking for
You
Like the melody of my song

I have looked for, a direction, a landmark
Split into two hemispheres
Like a mistake of the universe
I have thrown…
Too many bottles to the sea
Drank so much bitter liquor
It made my lips as cold as stone

You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking for
You
Like the melody of my song

You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking for
You
Like the melody of my song

Along our injuries
And our flippancies
It's when we completely lose our faith
That we find a lost paradise inside ourselves

Within us
Oh, you, you, you, you

You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking, looking for
You
Like the melody of my song
Like the melody of my song

You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking for
You
Like the melody of my song
Like the melody of my song

You
You're the one that's mаking me strong
I'll be looking, looking, looking for
You
Give me your love with my song
Give me your love with my ѕong
