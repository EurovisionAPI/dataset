Hear Them Calling

Can you hear them calling
Oh they're calling out tonight
Now the skies are burning
Oh they burn so bright

We shiver as we step into
The cold cold night
Then we're running we are running now

I hear them calling me
I hear them whispering
They're singing oh we are coming home

I hear them calling me
I hear them howling
Singing oh we are coming home

See the shadows dancing
Oh they dance for us tonight
And as I'm tossing and I'm turning
Oh they come alive

We shiver as we step into
The cold cold night
Then we're running we are running now

I hear them calling me
I hear them whispering
They're singing oh we are coming home

I hear them calling me
I hear them howling
Singing oh we are coming home
Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh

Can you hear them?
I hear them calling me
Oh oh oh
Can you hear them?
I hear them calling me
Oh oh oh

I hear them calling me
I hear them whispering
I hear them calling me
We're coming home

I hear them calling me
I hear them whispering
I hear them calling me
Now i'm coming home

I hear them calling me
I hear them whispering
I hear them calling me
I hear them whispering
They're ѕinging oh we are coming home
Singing oh we аre coming home
