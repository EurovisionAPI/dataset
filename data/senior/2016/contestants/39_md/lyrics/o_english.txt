Falling Stars

Lost in time, you're miles away
I try to speak or make a sound
The dark's around me when you go

The dream we had disappeared
Still I believe, I'm holding on
I didn't mean to let you go

We could be the greatest falling
The brightest falling stars

The sky is tumbling
It's coming down, coming down
The wildest fire
Is burning out, out

It'll have all turned us to pieces
All of our love turned into dust
We're the brightest falling stars

Flashing lights, I close my eyes
I let the sunlight comfort me
When all that's left are memories
We could be the brightest falling stars

The sky is tumbling
It's coming down, coming down
The wildest fire
Is burning out, out

It'll have all turned us to pieces
All of our love turned into dust
We're the brightest falling stars
(The brightest falling stars)

The thought of us will disappear
Still I believe, I'm holding on

The sky is tumbling
It's coming down, coming down
The wildest fire
Is burning out, out

It'll have all turned us to pieces
All of our love turned into dust
We're the brightest falling stаrѕ
