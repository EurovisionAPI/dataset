Soldiers of Love

Tell me why we always fuel the fire
why we tend to close our eyes
What's the reason now we keep on hidin'?
We can make it if we tried

I don't know why we don't care
There's nothing to fear when I know you are there
So let's not wait for someone else
To make it right, make it right

Take my hand and never let go
Side by side, we're on the open road
Unbreakable with hope in our hearts
Step by step, we make a new start

Let's be soldiers of love, soldiers of love
Soldiers of love for life
Take my hand and never let go, never let go
And let's be soldiers of love

What's the meaning of a world on fire?
And a heart without a soul
I believe that we can shine a light on
What we already ought to know

So let's not wait for someone else
To make it right, make it right

Take my hand and never let go
Side by side, we're on the open road
Unbreakable with hope in our hearts
Step by step, we make a new start

Let's be soldiers of love, soldiers of love
Soldiers of love for life
Take my hand and never let go, never let go
And let's be soldiers of love

Unbreakable, don't let it go
It's an open road, time to let it show
Invincible, gonna climb the wall

Take my hand and never let go
Never let go

Take my hand and never let go
Side by side, we're on the open road
Unbreakable with hope in our hearts
Step by step, we make a new start (Make a new start)

Let's be soldiers of love, soldiers of love
Soldiers of love for life
Take my hand аnd never let go, never let go
And let's be soldierѕ of love
