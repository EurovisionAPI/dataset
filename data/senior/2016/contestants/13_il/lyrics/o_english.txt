Made of stars

A language I don't understand
You speak, I listen, I'm your friend
(You hypnotize me)

Take my hand
A million faces tied in chains
You ride a Black horse in the rain
(You hypnotize me)

Don't escape no more, no more, no more, no more
'Cause we are all

Made of stars
Silver fragments falling
We are made of stars
We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars

You heal me, you fill me
Ignite a flame within me
(Hypnotize me)

I'm begging you
Don't escape no more, no more, no more, no more
'Cause we are all

Made of stars
Silver fragments falling
We are made of stars
We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars

Tell me that you understand
Come in close and take my hand
Let's float across the sky like there's no floor and there's no ceiling
Dance with me like we are made of stars
'Cause we are, 'cause we are, we are, we are, we are

We are made of stars
Silver fragments falling
We are made of stars
We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars

Dance with me like we are made of stars
Dance with me like we are made of stаrѕ
