Sunlight

Don't be afraid, it's only dark
Till the world turns round
Just don't look down if you're afraid of the higher ground
Hold on to me and let me hold on to you
We don't look back we let it slide out of view
And we can make it if we break out beyond these clouds

We'll be standing out in the sunlight
We stay together, we'll live forever in the sunlight
It's now or never you know you better
Just touch who you wanna, kiss who you gotta
Fight like we're winners, love like beginners
Dance like you mean it, sing like you feel it
Everything's better standing out in the sun

Stop for a moment just to take in the sights and sounds
Hold on to me and let me hold onto you
We don't look back, we let it slide out of view
There's no tomorrow so let's live in the here and now

We'll be standing out in the sunlight
We stay together, we'll live forever in the sunlight
It's now or never you know you better
Just touch who you wanna, kiss who you gotta
Fight like we're winners, love like beginners
Dance like you mean it, sing like you feel it
Everything's better standing out in the sun

Come turn me inside out upside down
I'll be your lover boy
Turn the music loud we can join the crowd in the sunlight
We stay together, we'll live forever in the sunlight

It's now or never you know you better
Just touch who you wanna, kiss who you gotta
Fight like we're winners, love like beginners
Dance like you mean it, sing like you feel it
Everything's better stаnding out in the ѕun
