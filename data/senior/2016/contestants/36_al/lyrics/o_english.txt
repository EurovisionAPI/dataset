Fairytale

This tale of love, larger than dreams
It may take a lifetime, to understand what it means
So many the tears, all the craziness and rage
Tale of love
The message is love can bring change

Cos it's you, only you
You I feel
And I, oh I
I know in my soul this is real

And that's why I love you, oh-oh
Yes I love you, oh-oh
And I'd fight for you, give my life for you
My heart

But comes a day when it's not enough
What you have, and the time is up
But it's hard to turn a new page
In this tale, sweet tale of love
You will find peace in your heart that you crave

(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

And that's why I love you, oh-oh
Yes I love you, oh-oh
And I'd fight for you, give my life for you
My heart

And that's why I love you, oh-oh
Yeѕ I love you, oh-oh
And I'd fight for you, give my life for you
My heart
And I'd fight for you, give my life for you
