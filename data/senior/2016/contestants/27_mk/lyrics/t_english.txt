Dona

From all the small things
this one is the most worthy
from all the great thoughts
from my entire world.
And when I turn back 
you are always there
as a hidden shadow 
silent God`s flower.

For all the things that you gave me
from my heart I thank you
for the entire passed time

Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona
Look at me
and smile
for me
Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona
my force, light, glow
you make me strong, you know, o Dona,
believe 
Believe in me

From all the small things 
this is the most worthy
from all the great thoughts 
from my entire world
I know whom I belong to
and where joy awaits me
on small clouds I walk
on pearl stairs

For all the things that you gave me
from my heart I thank you
for the entire passed time

Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona
Look at me
and smile
for me
Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona
my force, light, glow
you make me ѕtrong, you know, o Dona,
believe 
Believe in me

Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona, Donа
Believe in me
