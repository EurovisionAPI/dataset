Midnight Gold

When I came to you
Your smell on me
I reached around the bed
And grabbed a cigarette out of your bag

Sound of you breathing
Feel of your skin
Brought back some memories
I never thought this all could happen to me

Ten hours are missing
From memory
I vaguely can recall
Pain and pleasure mixing in one bowl

My mind is spinning
I know the bliss
One million miles away
My flesh and bones are dreaming in a haze

The stains of blood on your skin
Night will come, so we'll see
The stains of blood on your skin
Night will come, so we'll see

The stains of blood on your skin
Night will come, so we'll see
The stains of blood on your skin
On your skin, on your skin

When I came to you
Your ѕmell on me
I reached around the bed
And grabbed a cigarette out of your bаg
