The Last of Our Kind

Soldier, take off your armor
Show me your heart
This is home

And it's stronger, stronger than water
Deeper than reason, longer than time
Here we are at the end of the movie
I never felt more alive
It's time to rise

We're the last of our kind
It's a whole new world
And we're facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts
We're the last of our kind
And we're all that we know
And were out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though

We're the last of our kind, last of our kind
We're the last of our kind
Not afraid to be brave
We're the last of our kind

This is paradise, turn off the search light
We're where we belong
Standing tall at the end of the story
Watching worlds collide
It's time to rise

We're the last of our kind
It's a whole new world
And we're facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts
We're the last of our kind
And we're all that we know
And were out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though

Here we are now with nothing to loose
I know without love we wont pull through
Cause deep in the night
There is a light, and it guides us to truth

It's a whole new world
And we're facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts

We're the last of our kind
And we're all that we know
And we're out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though

We're the last of our kind, last of our kind
We're the last of our kind
Not afraid to be brave
We're the lаѕt of our kind
