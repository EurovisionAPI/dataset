Eloise

I'm pulling myself together before I go out
I thought that I was smart when I broke up with you, ah…
I'm missing you and here I am in front of your door
If I ring the bell, will you open your door
Or do you want me to leave?
So I'm asking you, please come out to me

Eloise, are we more than just friends?
If so, show me what your feel and later on our emotions can rule
Eloise, even the winds can change, for me you are the only one
Our love is worth a higher price, Eloise

It's not easy when you can't see your own mistakes
I'm like a small ball, in a pinball game, ah…
I'm missing you and here I am in front of your door
If I ring the bell, will you open your door
Or do you want me to leave?
So I'm asking you, please come out to me

Whoa… Eloise, are we more than just friends?
If so, show me what your feel and later on our emotions can rule
Eloise, even the winds can change, for me you are the only one
Our love is worth a higher price, Eloise

I'm waiting and hoping and longing, please tell me…

Eloise, even the winds can change, for me you are the only one
Our love is worth а higher price, Eloiѕe
