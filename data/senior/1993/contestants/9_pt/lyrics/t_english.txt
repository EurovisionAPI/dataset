The city (until dawn)

In the morning I go out, into the street
The city is in front of me
And suddenly the city is yours and mine
The city is everyone's

Between a gin and a kiss
We're going from pub to pub
I feel everything I see
There's a glow in the air

When the night falls in the city
There's always a dream and there's magic
At night in the city
There's always a dream until it's daytime

The colours of the night
Give a glow to the city
They make light until it's dawn

Between the moon and the sun
We're going from street to street
Tomorrow morning
It'll be another day

When the night falls in the city
There's always a dream and there's magic
At night in the city
There's always a dream until it's daytime

(When the night falls in the city)
(There's always a dream and there's magic)
At night in the city
There's always a dream

When the night falls in the city
There's always a dream and there's magic
At night in the city
There's always a dream
Until it'ѕ dаytime
