Sing

On the banks of the Jordan, in bygone times
I grew up among other people who sing
They sang in the warm night to cheer up their spirit
And they are those who left me my songs

Sing, sing with a great voice
Don't leave strength for tomorrow
Sing, sing and light a fire
Because the song is all we have

Sing, sing with a great voice
Don't leave strength for tomorrow
Sing, sing and light a fire
Because the song is all we have

And since then the songs accompany my life
I always sing with my brothers and friends
The warm singing of many people could break any wall
And open hearts, plant loves

Sing, sing with a great voice
Don't leave strength for tomorrow
Sing, sing and light a fire
Because the song is all we have

Sing a song, sing till you can no more
Let the world know what you're singing for
Sing a song, oh, sing it loud and high
Till it reaches up to the sky

The land has changed its image and its spirit
But the singing of many people hasn't lost its strength
This song is uniting and it remains for us a witness
And in every generation, the people carry a song

Sing, sing with a great voice
Don't leave strength for tomorrow
Sing, sing and light a fire
Because the song is all we have
All we have

Sing a song, sing till you can no more
Let the world know what you're singing for
Sing a song, oh, sing it loud and high
Till it reaches up to the sky

Let the world know
