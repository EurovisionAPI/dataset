Someone like you

I have never loved someone this way before
All my doubts are over forever
I never had this nice feeling before
You're everything what I mean

In your eyes I see that heavenly-blue
A warm feeling that I love
I have never loved someone this way before
Such a someone like you

Wherever I am, you'll be with me
With you, I can always find the right way
Oh… I have never loved someone this way before
Such a someone like you

You'll be in my thoughts forever
Whatever may happen to us
Know for sure that I'll wait for you
Even in the middle of the night

You give me wings, a free feeling
Now, that's exactly what I mean
I have never loved someone this way before
Such a someone like you
Such а ѕomeone like…

Someone like you
