Under the stars of the sky

I sit down on the edge of your bed and you laugh at me
And the world shrinks to nothing when I look at you
You're lying as quiet as a mouse and seem indescribably small
Among all of your funny bears, but in the dream game
We find the way out to new adventures

Under the stars of the sky, you're sailing with me
Close your eyes silently now, then we're on our way
We're sailing across the water and into the dream land, you and I

And if you're frightened by the wind I'll kiss you gently on the cheek
Wherever you are in your imagination I'll always be here by you, my darling
Now safely put your hand in mine

Under the stars of the sky, you're sailing with me
Close your eyes silently now, then we're on our way
We're sailing across the water and into the dream land, you and I
The dream land, you and I
