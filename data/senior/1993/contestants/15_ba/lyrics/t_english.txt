All the pain in the world

I can't take the stars down from the sky
I can't find the way, the way to universe
But I can send you this song
So you'll know I'm alive, my love

Tonight when tears on my face freeze up
I won't let the fear take me over
I still have the strength to win alone
If we were together, it'd be easier

All the pain in the world tonight is in Bosnia
I'm staying to defy the fear
I'm not afraid to stand in front of the wall
I can sing, I can win

Tonight when tears on my face freeze up
I won't let the fear take me over
Who will be the guard instead of me
So that another evil doesn't occur?

All the pain in the world tonight is in Bosnia
I'm staying to defy the fear
I'm not afraid to stand in front of the wall
I can sing, I can win

All the pain in the world tonight is in Bosnia
I'm staying to defy the fear
I'm not afraid to stand in front of the wall
I can ѕing, I cаn win
