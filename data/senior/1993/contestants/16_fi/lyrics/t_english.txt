Come to me

Come to me, be a white cloud in the sky
Come to me, be a dew in the morning
Come to me, come, let's get on the airship
Come to me, come, let's run to the world

Come to me, come quietly, come secretly
Come to me, bring a light to the dark night
Come to me, the most beautiful flame burns a moment
Come to me, come to me, come to me

Let's listen, let's watch, let's go
Come to me, there's only a little moment of time
Come to me, doors will soon be closed
To the care of a white cloud in the sky, come to me

Let's listen, let's watch, let's go
Come to me, there's only a little moment of time
Come to me, doors will soon be closed
To the care of a white cloud in the sky, come to me

Come to me, touch me like a wave touches the beach
Come to me, bring a peace to the surge of soul
Come to me, wind carries a wish far away
Come to me, come to me, come to me

Let's listen, let's watch, let's go
Come to me, there's only a little moment of time
Come to me, doors will soon be closed
To the care of a white cloud in the sky, come to me

Let's listen, let's watch, let's go
Come to me, there's only a little moment of time
Come to me, doors will soon be closed
To the care of а white cloud in the ѕky, come to me

Come to me
