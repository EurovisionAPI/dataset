Then you'll know the answer

Open your eyes, see where you are
I am and wait for you there
The mind carries you through another path, but where?
Still carrying on, questions start to burn

I wait
You look for answers all around
Where does this journey end?
For what are you leaving?
Then years pass by
And leave a little advise
If you come to me
Then you'll know the answer

Why are you running, searching far and near?
I'm not hiding from you, I am everywhere

I wait
You look for answers all around
Where does this journey end?
For what are you leaving?
Then years pass by
And leave a little advise
If you come to me
Then you'll know the answer

I wait
You look for answers all around
If you come to me
Then you'll know the аnѕwer
