Sun of Europe

They run in their cars, they play taking each other
Along a street bathed in bars
They play living but they wear themselves out
And the days never change

And the first light comes, beyond the outskirts
And little houses carry them away
And the dreams never change

Hurry up, sun, make you see
They shoot again but they're waiting for you
Put a beam in your heart, if you discover where it is
Rise for me, come up with me, warm me up again

They don't know each other, still they resemble each other
And the dreams never change

If they take your hand, they are looking for some company
But the wind and the war carry them away
But the dreams never change

Wake up, sun, so we can feel you
Today nobody asks for you
Cover Europe with light, do you remember where it is?
Come with me, fly with me, warm me up again

They change their uniform and colour
But their tired souls wait for the sun
And they say he'll come
They believe he'll come

Wake us up, sun, make us understand
How much pain you've carried with you
Give us a light beam in this gloom
Rise for us, come up with us, warm uѕ up agаin
