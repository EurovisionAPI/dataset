Men

All men are so selfish
That they've mistaken male for macho
All men are so conceited
That they've forgotten to be thankful

They're like this by nature
They live, ruled by their vanity
They run, driven by their longing for winning
And nothing else
They use their brain, never their heart
They fly like crows around you
And they say love for sex

They're like this since prehistory
They follow the whims of their will
When they've got everything, they always want much more
It's normal

Whatever they may say, they're right
Whatever they may do, I'm telling you
They can't say sorry

All men are untidy
And they keep being spoiled children
All men are so special
That they've managed to be all the same

But if they're not around, we feel lonely
They say little honeymouthed words
Such beautiful things that make us sigh
And drive us crazy

Men and women in intimacy
Are like two lighthouses in the dark
Like two mysteries to be solved
They're complementary like war and peace
Like sun and moon, like land and sea
They're irresistible, they're like a magnet
That makes the world go round

Whatever they may say, they're right
Whatever they may do, I'm telling you
They can't say sorry

Men and women in intimacy
Are like two lighthouses in the dark
Like two mysteries to be solved
They're complementary like war and peace
Like sun and moon, like land and sea
They're irresistible, they're like a magnet
That makes the world go round

Men and women in intimacy
Are like two lighthouses in the dark
Like two mysteries to be solved
They're complementary like war and peace
Like sun and moon, like land and sea
They're irresistible, they're like a magnet
That mаkeѕ the world go round
