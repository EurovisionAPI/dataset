Don't stop

Into our lives we enter naked
The same end and beginning define us
But there are some of us, the beggars of happiness

Don't stop helping people
Don't overtake, don't fear seeing the wrecks
And if life is occasionally hurt by the truth
Don't stop, don't stop

Whatever you own I own as well, brother
But there are others who never laughed
Their sight is unclear, and they carry a cross

Don't stop helping people
Don't overtake, don't fear seeing the wrecks
And if life is occasionally hurt by the truth
Don't stop, don't stop

And if life is occasionally hurt by the truth
Don't stop, don't stop
And if life is occasionаlly hurt by the truth
Don't stop, don't stop

Don't stop, don't stop, don't ѕtop
