This Time

Oo baby, when I'm alone with you, you show your love for me
I beleived that our love was for real, but I knew it was too good to be true

Oh baby, baby, when I found out that you were foolin' around with my heart
It hurt so much, pain unexplained
How could you do it? - I thought I found love

This time I'm gonna stand on my own
I said, now, baby, this time I won't be missin' you at all
No, no, now, baby, this time I'll be strong, I won't fall in love again

You thought I was usin' your love, wastin' all your time, that's where you were wrong
Oh baby, baby, when I found out that you went wrong with foolin' around with my little heart
It hurt so much, pain unexplained
How could you do it when I thought I found love?

This time I'm gonna stand on my own
Said, now, baby, this time I won't be missin' you at all
No, no, now, baby, baby, I'll be strong, I'll be strong, yeah
(This time)
This time I won't be needin' your lovin' for me, baby
Baby, babe, baby, I'm gettin' by
This time I'll be ѕtrong, I won't fall in love agаin
