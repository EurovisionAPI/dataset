Much too far

Somewhere in time and space
There must be far worlds
Untouched and beautiful and still filled with life

Life without fear and misery
No hatred and malice to be found
Stars, bright and clear, so you can almost touch them
I believe in it

But it's much too far away
Outside in the darkness
Much too far away
Here is our reality

Somewhere in that dream
There must be far wishes
None is as deep as our wish to live

Life like in paradise
Without paying for it
So you can paint in thousand colours like a painting
I believe in it

But it's much too far away
Outside in the darkness
Much too far away
Here is our reality

Much too far away
Further away than ever before
Much too far away
Yet so near to touch

Much too far away
Outside in the darkness
Much too far away
Here is our reality

Somewhere in time and space
There has been a world
Untouched and beautiful, and with that, life haѕ begun
And what came next?
And what cаme next?
