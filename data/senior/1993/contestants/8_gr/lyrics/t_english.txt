Greece, country of light

Greece, country of light, the world's beginning and comeback
A place chosen by God, something's going on, you don't give a damn
Difficult times are coming, and the sky is shouting to you
Sit down and think, get to your senses

One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli
Children of Plato and Aristotle
They trick us with sadness and taste
Oh immortal spirit, cankers are destroying you

One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli
Children of Plato and Aristotle
They trick us with sadness and taste
Oh immortal spirit, cankers are destroying you

Greece, country of light, peaceful fighter
Make another move to the from, go forward, it's time
You are the world's wine, even if you don't know it
Sit down and figure it out and stand up and tell it

One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli
Children of Plato and Aristotle
They trick us with sadness and taste
Oh immortal spirit, cankers are destroying you

One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli
Children of Plato and Aristotle
They trick us with sadness and taste
Oh immortal spirit, cankers are destroying you

One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli
Children of Plato аnd Ariѕtotle
