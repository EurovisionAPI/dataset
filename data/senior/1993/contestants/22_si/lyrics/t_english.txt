A quiet rainy day

A quiet rainy day, I close my eyes, wander far away
I paint a shadow over past days and fade away

How well I merge with this world that dazes me
How I'm absorbed in time that doesn't exist

What would the world be without dreams
(What would?)
When good luck squanders?
What would time be without dreams?
(What would?)
Life would be in vain

What would the world be without dreams
(What would?)
When good luck squanders?
What would time be without dreams?
Time without dreams

The blue sky there, in the distance, the bell is heard
In the morning breeze another victim follows me

How well I merge with this world that dazes me
How I'm absorbed in time that doesn't exist

What would the world be without dreams
(What would?)
When good luck squanders?
What would time be without dreams?
(What would?)
Life would be in vain

What would the world be without dreams
(What would?)
When good luck squanders?
What would time be without dreams?
Time without dreаmѕ
