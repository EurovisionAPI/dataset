Give me a chance

Whoa… ooh…

Alone, looking into the night
A star shines, maybe for me
It's not easy to say that my life capsizes
I need you
It's a game we've got to live
I want to know if I already lost it
But I still want to believe in it
Telling you about all my hopes

Give me a chance to tell you
The words that will lead you
On the road of your desires
Give me a chance to tell you
The words to seduce you
To live all our pleasures again

Turn my world with a bit of nice care
Be my rose that always blossoms for me
Be my star in the night
But I still want to believe in it
Tell you about all my hopes

Give me a chance to tell you
The words that will lead you
On the road of your desires
Give me a chance to tell you
The words to seduce you
To live all our pleasures again

Maybe tomorrow you'll be going far away
But give me my chance, I need you so much

Give me a chance to tell you
The words that will lead you
On the road of your desires
Give me a chance to tell you
The words to seduce you
To live all our pleasureѕ agаin
