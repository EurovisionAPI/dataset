Mary Magdalene

Mary Magdalene – guide me on my way
Keep me warm until our judgement day

Like a thunder struck by lightning, like a stormy sea
Like a wonder, more than I could be
Came into my life of sorrow, took away my heart
Showed me all my secret wishes, gave me a lucky card

Give me love and strong affection, let me feel your spell
Give me hope and satisfaction, keep my fortune well

Mary Magdalene – angel in disguise
Mary Magdalene – tell me sweet, sweet lies
Mary Magdalene – guide me on my way
Keep me warm until our judgement day

Guardian angel out of hell or a devil is disgrace
That feeling is on in many ways
Shout so my desire'd keep our fire burn so strong
A love so true will never turn out wrong

Be my Virgin, be my lover, be my secret dream
Be the keeper of the Grail and be my gorgeous queen

Mary Magdalene – angel in disguise
Mary Magdalene – tell me sweet, sweet lies
Mary Magdalene – guide me on my way
Keep me warm until our judgement day

Mary Magdalene – angel in disguise
Mary Magdalene – tell me sweet, sweet lieѕ
Mary Magdalene – guide me on my way
Keep me warm until our judgement dаy
