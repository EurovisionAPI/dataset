Mary Magdalene

Mary Magdalene – give me your power
Forever and not just for one night

Like thunder without any warning, like the first day
Like the Flood, more than I can suffer
You were coming over me, you ran over me
You conquered my heart in a storm, like a hurricane

Heaven or hell
Where you come from is all the same to me
Both inside of you, good and evil
It makes me poor and rich

Mary Magdalene – you are happiness and sorrow
Mary Magdalene – give me eternity
Mary Magdalene – give me your might
Forever and not just for one night

Your eyes crying for love
Yearning is the name for your look
Going onwards, never again backwards
You are one of the sirens, seen by Odysseus
I untie myself and place myself in danger

Only those who suffer are alive
Who feels nothing are dead
To take pain, to give love
That's my command

Mary Magdalene – you are happiness and sorrow
Mary Magdalene – give me eternity
Mary Magdalene – give me your might
Forever and not just for one night

Maria Magdalena – you are happiness and sorrow
Maria Magdalena – give me eternity
Maria Magdalena – give me your might
Forever аnd not juѕt for one night
