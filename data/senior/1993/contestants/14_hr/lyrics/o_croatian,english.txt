Don't Ever Cry

Tisuće snova dalekih, ruža u srcima zaspalih
Leptira tisuće šarenih, k'o duše nevinih

Osamnaest godina, moga Ivana
Moli za njega, pjesmo anđela

Don't ever cry, don't ever cry
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Don't ever cry, don't ever cry
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye

Osamnaest godina, moga Ivana
Moli za njega, pjesmo anđela

Mir daj nam ti, mir daj nam ti
Nebo ljubavi, nebo ljubavi
Mir daj nam ti, mir daj nam ti
Nebo ljubavi, nebo ljubavi

Don't ever cry, don't ever cry
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Don't ever cry, don't ever cry
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye

Don't ever cry, my Croatiаn ѕky
