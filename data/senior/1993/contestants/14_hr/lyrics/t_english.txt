Don't Ever Cry

Thousands of distant dreams, roses asleep in our hearts
Thousands of colourful butterflies, innocent like souls

My Ivan is eighteen years old
Pray for him, angels' song

Don't ever cry, don't ever cry
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Don't ever cry, don't ever cry
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye

My Ivan is eighteen years old
Pray for him, angels' song

Give us peace, give us peace
Sky of love, sky of love
Give us peace, give us peace
Sky of love, sky of love

Don't ever cry. don't ever cry
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Don't ever cry, don't ever cry
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye

Don't ever cry, my Croatiаn ѕky
