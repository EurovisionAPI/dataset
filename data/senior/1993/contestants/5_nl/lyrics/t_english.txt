Peace

Even the most expensive car can't swim
And when it's wet, it has trouble braking
That's why something is done to the asphalt
So that no drop of water remains on it

We all know that magicians deceive
And that no man on earth can fly by himself
The real reason why the airplane exists now
Is the fact that gliding doesn't happen on its own

We build houses to withstand hurricanes
And make ships to sail in every storm
We're working on a light bulb that never burns out
It only just won't work to keep peace
(To keep)

Each new apple tree that is born
Isn't endowed by nature with ears to hear
But through genetics we'll manage to teach it
To guarantee taste and quality

We build houses to withstand hurricanes
And make ships to sail in every storm
We're working on a light bulb that never burns out
It only just won't work to keep peace

When no bridge is too far
Every clock will chime at the same hour
When no road is too long
No man wants to hit another man ever again
Woh, oh…

We build houses to withstand hurricanes
And make ships to sail in every storm
We're working on a light bulb that never burns out
It only juѕt won't work to keep peаce
