Could It Be That I'm In Love

I don't know why I want you
The way that I want you
And I don't know why I miss you
The way that I miss you

But when I'm in your arms
It makes me feel so good
And I don't know the reason why
I don't know the reason why

And I don't understand
Why I feel the way I do
And I don't understand
What I feel when I'm with you
And anyway now, it's no use worrying
Until I find out what it is

Could it be that when I'm with you
My fears all go away?
Could it be that when I'm with you
It's like the start of a brand new day?
Or is it just that when I hold you
I can't hold you enough?
Or could it be that I'm in love?

Somebody once told me:
"You've gotta trust your heart"
(Gotta trust your heart)
And this I have tried to do
Right from the very start
And when I'm close to you
It makes me feel so good
And I don't know the reason why

Could it be that when I'm with you
My fears all go away?
Could it be that when I'm with you
It's like the start of a brand new day?
Or is it juѕt that when I hold you
I can't hold you enough?
Or could it be that I'm in love?

Could it be that I'm in love?
Could it be thаt I'm in love?
