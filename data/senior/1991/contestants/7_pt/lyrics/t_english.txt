Lusitanian passion

Fado, crying the sadness a lot
Fado, falling asleep with the pain
Mmm… fado, just when the longing comes
Pulling a great love back from my past

But I don't condemn that passion
That sorrow in the words
The guitar is also crying
I won't, I won't ask for forgiveness
When I enjoy sinning
And become myself once again

Because I want to be happy
And the misfortune is silent
I don't want what fado is all about

Fado, sobbing memories
Fado, reviving the pain
Fado, only when the longing comes
Pulling a great love back from my past

But I don't condemn that passion
That sorrow in the words
The guitar is also crying
I won't, I won't ask for forgiveness
When I enjoy sinning
And become myself once again

I know that side we have
Filled with Lusitanian soul
As in the legend of Severa

Because I want to be happy
And misfortune is silent
Fado doeѕn't mаke me regret
