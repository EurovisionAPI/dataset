Two minutes

Turn back and have a look, it's as if the old days are coming back
But they go by, don't forget this
The years will pass by quickly, but don't forget to live
Do not worry about passed ones, come on, two minutes

Even though love might fly away at its best moment
But he/she loves, don't forget this
The years will pass by quickly, but don't forget to live
Do not worry about passed ones, come on, two minutes

Same thing for you and me
Same thing for him and her
C'mon let's live
There is no difference, it's all the same
With days full of joy we'll have another kind of life… another kind of life

Turn back and have a look, it's as if the old days are coming back
But they go by, don't forget this
The years will pass by quickly, but don't forget to live
Do not worry about passed ones, come on, two minutes

Even though love might fly away at its best moment

Turn back and have a look, it's as if the old days are coming back
But they go by, don't forget this
The years will pass by quickly, but don't forget to live
Do not worry about pаssed ones, come on, two minutes
Two minutes… two minuteѕ

Wooh…
