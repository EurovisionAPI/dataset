Spring

If you come and get dressed at my night
If you come and hide in my body
If you come and get entangled in my nets
One thing you should know, you won't be betrayed

If you come and get dressed at my night
If you come and hide in my body
If you come and get entangled in my nets
One thing you should know, you won't be betrayed

It will be as if the spring comes in
It will be devoutness of sky
It will be as if the spring comes in
Suddenly

It will be as if the spring comes in
It will be devoutness of sky
It will be as if the spring comes in
Suddenly

If we are open to the winds
If we are faithful to what we live
If the thread of love binds us
Our two bodies will be hanging gardens

It will be as if the spring comes in
It will be devoutness of sky
It will be as if the spring comes in
Suddenly

It will be as if the spring comes in
It will be devoutness of sky
It will be as if the spring comes in
Suddenly

It will be as if the spring comes in
It will be devoutness of sky
It will be аs if the spring comeѕ in
Suddenly
