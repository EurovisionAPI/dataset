Crazy night

I didn't even want to own you
I didn't even want to love you
We two travellers came across each other
Shared one common moment together

I was left behind when the morning took you away
My heart won't give me peace
I can't let go, I need you
But I'm hoping in vain for you to be next to me

One crazy night, the wild heart is beating
I suppose we had time to give each other something
One crazy night, the wild heart is beating
We didn't even want to bear the responsibility

I can't find you in my arms anymore
I'm touching you only in my sleep
In my sleep

I didn't even want to own you
I didn't even want to love you
Just one night is so easy to forget
But the hungry heart cannot find any peace

One crazy night, the wild heart is beating
I suppose we had time to give each other something
One crazy night, the wild heart is beating
We didn't even want to bear the responsibility

I can't find you in my arms anymore
I'm touching you only in my sleep

One crazy night, the wild heart is beating
I suppose we had time to give each other something
One crazy night, the wild heart is beating
We didn't even want to bear the responsibility

One crazy night, hey…
(One crazy night, the wild heart is beating)
(I suppose we had time to give each other something)
One crazy night, ha…
(One crazy night, the wild heart is beating)
(We didn't even want to bear the responѕibility)
One crаzy night
