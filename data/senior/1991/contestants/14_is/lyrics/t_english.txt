The dream about Nina

Now you are beside me, Nina
Caressing my cheek, Nina
Oh… hold my hand, Nina
For you know that I will never again
I will never, never again
Never again share a moment with you

It hurts to miss someone
Life goes on, but for what reason?
I do not want to wake up from you
Because I know that you will never ever
You will never, never ever
Never ever caress my cheek

When you appear in my dreams everything is sweet and good
I wish I could sleep for a century
Because the night only offers a moment with you

When I wake up – Nina, you are no longer here
My eyes open – but there's no one to caress my cheek

A day is like an eternity, without you
The night is cold and empty, without you
When the night comes I go to you

When you appear in my dreams everything is sweet and good
I wish I could sleep for a century
Because the night only offers a moment with you

When I wake up – Nina, you are no longer here
My eyes open – but there's no one to caress my cheek

When I wake up – oh… Nina, you are no longer here
My eyes open – but there's no one to cаresѕ my cheek
