Venice in the rain

Lights in the rain, I've seen you
A smile like soft magic
Enchanted, frozen, completely lost in you
Feelings as deep as the night

Silent realization, and longing for more
Tender eyes, I want to belong to you

Venice in the rain
Let us this night simply dream
Venice in the rain
To the end of the night simply dream

Your light breath, buried in my shoulder
Your magic deep down in me
Felt, sensed, carried away from you
To be by you and yet not here

Silent realization, and longing for more
Tender eyes, I want to belong to you

Venice in the rain
Let us this night simply dream
Venice in the rain
To the end of the night simply dream

Venice in the rain
(Let us this night) simply dream
Venice in the rain
To the end of the night simply dream

Venice in the rain
(Let us this night) ѕimply dream
