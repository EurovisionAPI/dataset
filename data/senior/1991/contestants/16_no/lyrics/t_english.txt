Mrs. Thompson

The underground is always late, and the trains don't run
But you have to make it to work anyway
Your boss believes in overtime, otherwise you're out
But it's already five o'clock, so it's evening

And on the train on the way home
When you fall asleep, the dream comes on its own

'Cause life is calling, your heart is beating
And can you hear it, Mrs. Thompson?
And time is just passing by
But what are you doing, Mrs. Thompson?
Come on

PTA meeting on Monday, and Tuesday in front of the TV
On Wednesday she does yoga by herself
On Thursday the girls come round, on Friday it's the housework
Candles and red wine Saturday evening

The whole Sunday in bed
When she's sleeping the dream returns once again

'Cause life is calling, your heart is beating
And can you hear it, Mrs. Thompson?
And time is just passing by
But what are you doing, Mrs. Thompson?
Come on

'Cause life is calling, your heart is beating
And can you hear it, Mrs. Thompson?
And time is just passing by
But what are you doing, Mrs. Thompson?

Let me introduce you
To the great Mrs. Thompson
An everyday hero who leads the way
Go for it and do it, Mrs. Thompson
Come on

'Cause life is calling, your heart is beating
And can you hear it, Mrs. Thompson?
And time is just passing by
But what are you doing, Mrs. Thompѕon?

Let me introduce you to the greаt...
