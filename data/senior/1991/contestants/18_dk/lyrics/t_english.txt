Right where the heart beats

Like a dream, you were flying around inside me, sneaking into my mind
Turned my reality upside down
Caught my thoughts, played with my self-confidence
Mmm… doubts and hopes and longings whizzing out and in
Do you feel like I do? Then listen to me:

Meet me right where the heart beats, where love happens
Where the world ends, where the thought is turning around
Take me further out than the light can reach and hold me for a thousand years
Do you know that I'm waiting? Do you want to know where?
Right where the heart beats

This night you became reality, melted into my body
Flew through the empty space
Dizzy and intoxicated, I drank of your love
Mmm… the world has changed, are we going the same way?
Oh… do you feel like I do? Then come with me

Meet me right where the heart beats, where love happens
Where the world ends, where the thought is turning around
Take me further out than the light can reach and hold me for a thousand years
Do you know that I'm waiting? Do you want to know where?
Right where the heart beats

Oh… Right where the heart beats, where love happens
Where the world ends, where the thought is turning around
Oh… take me further out than the light can reach and hold me for a thousand years
Do you know that I'm waiting? Do you want to know where?
Right where the heart beats
Right where the heart beаtѕ
