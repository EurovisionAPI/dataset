Give it up

Isn't it true that I told you long ago
To forget him?
Come back to me
Give it up, come back to me
Haha haha haha haha haha… ooh…

You always keep trying
He really isn't worth it
Don't just follow him

Give it up, give it up
Give it up, girl
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, girl

I give you more than anyone has ever given you
I'm always concerned about you
If you think about the times we spent together
You'd never leave me again

Give it up, give it up
Give it up, girl
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, girl

I'll keep hoping
I want you close to me, day and night
I'd sell my soul
If the devil would bring you bаck to me

Give it up, give it up
Give it up, girl
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, girl

Give it up, give it up
Give it up, girl
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, girl

(Give it up, give it up)
I'll keep hoping
(Give it up, girl)
I'd sell my ѕoul

Give it up, give it up
Give it up, girl

Ah… give it up
