How sweet is the sea

Love, sun, sea, moon and stars
Beautiful words, they're beautiful words
Sweeter than those nobody has ever written
They're just words, words but
Only the one who never falls in love
Doesn't have a heart to sing

But how sweet the sea is
How sweet you are
When love is young
You feel like singing

But how beautiful the sun is
When you stand by me
When I call you butterfly
Fly and I'll fly with you

And round, round, the world goes
Round among the stars and I can't stop
And you sing, sing a song
That nobody can hear, that nobody knows
It has always been like this, and it'll always be the same
Love is what makes us live

Love, sun, sea, moon and stars
Are always nice to sing about

But how sweet the sea is
How sweet you are
When love is young
You feel like singing

But how sweet the sun is
When you ѕtand by me
When I call you butterfly
Fly and I'll fly with you

When I call you butterfly
Fly аnd I'll fly for you
