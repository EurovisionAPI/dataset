Captured By A Lovestorm

I will never stand alone
Or be the one to chase distant memories
You can open hearts of stone
With every touch of grace, you were there to set me free

Could it be I'm on the road to paradise?
One step closer to the heaven in your eyes

I am captured by a lovestorm from your heart
Givin' me a brand new start, and it's gonna last forever
Captured by a lovestorm day and night
Feelin' only what is right, you're the reason love is here to stay

Make the best of what we share
The moments passing by will not come again
I can feel it in the air
Like raindrops from the sky softly blowin' in the wind

Without no regrets, I'll leave the past behind
So much love to follow till the end of time

I am captured by a lovestorm from your heart
Givin' me a brand new start, and it's gonna last forever
Captured by a lovestorm day and night
Feelin' only what is right, you're the reason love is here to stay

We'll stand together
United by the power of love
I'm yours forever, free to sing
Like angels from above

I am captured by a lovestorm
Captured by a lovestorm (From your heart)
Givin' me a brand new start, and it's gonna last forever
Captured by a lovestorm day and night
Feelin' only what is right, you're the reason love is here to stay
