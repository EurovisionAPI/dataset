Brazil

La lalala lalala…
Lalala lalala… lalala lalala…
La lalala lalala…
Lalala lalala… lalala lalala…

Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Cuba and America
Samba, rumba, cha cha cha

Take it all off
Take your shoes off now
Take your jacket and pants off
Come on, the game is starting now

For your lips and my neck
Your kiss will be the sign
For Rambo, Dino, what, what, what
I made a new dance

Brazil
One turn-around, that's two
Say hop and that's three
Your heart is us
Brazil
I don't need Brazil
The sweet life, cha cha cha
Only you and me with you

Take it all off
Take your shoes off now
Take your jacket and pants off
Come on, the game is starting now

For your lips and my neck
Your kiss will be the sign
For Rambo, Dino, what, what, what
I made a new dance

Brazil
One turn-around, that's two
Say hop and that's three
Your heart is us
Brazil
I don't need Brazil
The sweet life, cha cha cha
Only you and me with you

La lalala lalala…
Lalala lalala… lalala lalala…
La lalala lalala…
Lalala lalala… lalala lalala…

For your lips and my neck
Your kiss will be the sign
For Rambo, Dino, what, what, what
I made a new dance

Brazil
One turn-around, that's two
Say hop and that's three
Your heart is us
Brazil
I don't need Brazil
The sweet life, cha cha cha
Only you and me with you

Brazil
One turn-around, that's two
Say hop and that's three
Your heart is us
Brazil
I don't need Brazil
The ѕweet life, cha cha cha
Only you and me and
Oh Brаzil
