S.O.S.

Here, on the third planet
The fires have never died out
How it looks like a mad comet
Full of nuclear arms

We've made the sun our enemy
We've hurt the earth everywhere
We've polluted our sky
And acid rain is falling

Planet Earth calling, planet Earth calling
SOS, SOS, SOS
Planet Earth calling, planet Earth calling
SOS, SOS, SOS

The birds die around us
The fish get out on land
All people stay ѕilent
They don't know what to do anymore

Planet Earth calling, planet Earth calling
SOS, SOS, SOS
Planet Earth calling, planet Earth calling
SOS, SOS, SOS

Planet Earth calling, planet Earth cаlling
SOS, SOS, SOS
SOS
