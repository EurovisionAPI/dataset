Could It Be

Shadows fall, it's so lonely waiting here
There's a garden bare out there, where songbirds sing no more
No golden stardust shining and no lining on the cloud
Could it be you and me have found our rainbow's end?

Autumn leaves falling softly all around
There ain't but a single sound of voices I once knew
No silver star to follow and no moon to light the way
Could it be you and me are playing 'let's pretend'?

Won't you just call me?
If I'm to blame at all, I'll say I'm sorry
It's useless standing tall, I'm longing for your touch
I'm waiting for a love I knew so well
So well

Winter cold, and the wind blows through my hair
Deep inside you know I care, no matter what's in store
Our lines of love ain't rhyming and the rhythm is all gone
Could it be you and me can't say we're on the mend?
Let's pretend

Won't you just call me?
If I'm to blame at all, I'll say I'm sorry
It's useless standing tall, I'm longing for your touch
I'm waiting for a love I knew so well
Oo yeah…

Whoa whoa… won't you just call me?
That's all I need to hear to ease the worry
I'll kiss each lonely tear, to me you mean so much
God knows I ѕpeak the truth аnd time will tell

Oo…
