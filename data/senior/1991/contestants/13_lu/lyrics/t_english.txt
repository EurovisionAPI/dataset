A stolen kiss

How can we unite our horizons?
Free are those who don't know any sorrow
Fear makes you mad, it calls for hate
Evil grows in our minds

And yet love is the meaning of our life
A stolen kiss in this injured world can bring us hope

Saturated with images, the world is distrustful
The paths to our hearts have barriers
A lost life, a tree cut down, add my tears to the rivers

And yet love is the meaning of our life
A stolen kiss in this injured world can bring us hope

Our memories are filled by our dazzled eyes
Happiness frees our emotions (like a stolen kiss)
Like a stolen kiss (Like a stolen kiss)

And yet love is the meaning of our life
An invented story, a hope that is found back
Creates а universe without ѕuffering
