This dream must never die

And they taught us to fight
And we learnt to lose
In the search for freedom
We often let ourselves be seduced

Whatever they told us
We believed in it all
Although many words
Were built of sand

But the time for lies will have to come to an end
When there's no more hate, we will be forever free

This dream must never die
This dream must never disappear
Many things must change
And so much must happen

This dream must never die
And a miracle will happen
Once love triumphs
And our dream will come true

On the way to the future
Many wishes will come true
But we reach for the stars
And forget the danger

Nobody sees the shadow
Following us at night
Someone deals the cards
And we are in his power

But the time for tears will have to come to an end
When there is no more fear, we will be forever free

This dream must never die
This dream must never disappear
Many things must change
And so much must happen

This dream must never die
And a miracle will happen
Once love triumphѕ
And our dreаm will come true
