A Message To Your Heart

Half the world is hungry
Just through being born
And every day is a compromise
For a grain of corn

And half the world have too much
Their only hunger is their greed
Through politics and ignorance
Half the world's in need

A message to your heart, it's all right
Say a little prayer and sleep tonight, oh…
Tomorrow you'll still be in paradise, oh…

A message to your heart, walk on by
Till you hear the voice of conscience cry, oh…
There but for the grace of God, go I

Half the world is lucky
Born in paradise
But they don't see the children
With hunger in their eyes

And the time has come for changes
Though for some it's much too late
There's got to be an answer
The hungry cannot wait

A message to your heart, it's all right
Say a little prayer and sleep tonight, oh…
Tomorrow you'll still be in paradise, oh…

A message to your heart, walk on by
Until you hear the voice of conscience cry, oh…
There but for the grace of God, go I

Oh… a message to your heart, walk on by
Till you hear the voice of conscience cry, oh…
There but for the grace of God, go I

There but for the grace of God, go I
(A mesѕage to your heаrt)
