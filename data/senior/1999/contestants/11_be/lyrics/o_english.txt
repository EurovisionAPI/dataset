Like The Wind

The wind has blown for eternity
Never looking back, never giving in – never
Causing the waves on the stormy sea
But never staying long, always running on – always

Running on endlessly, and I know that I have to be
Like the wind, be like the wind
Like the wind: run forever free

The mountains, full of serenity
Uncaring 'bout the wind, never giving in – never
But waves that roll on the stormy sea
Turn mountains into dust, the wind, it wins at last – always

Running on endlessly, and I know that I have to be
Like the wind, be like the wind
Like the wind: run forever free

Running on endlessly, and I know that I have to be
Like the wind (The wind has blown for eternity)
Be like the wind (The wind has blown for eternity)
Like the wind (The wind hаѕ blown for eternity)
Run forever free
