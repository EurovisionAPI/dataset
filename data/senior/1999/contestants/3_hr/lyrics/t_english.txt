Mary Magdalene

For your love got me crucified
And released me of all my sins
As God is my witness, I swear by my heart
That this woman knows, she belongs to you entirely

Mary Magdalene, Mary Magdalene
Ah… Mary Magdalene
Ah…

The night guided me around the world
I told her: "Stop!" ah… "I won't go any further"
As God is my witness, I swear by my heart
That this woman knows, she belongs to you entirely

Mary Magdalene, Mary Magdalene
Ah… Mary Magdalene
Ah…

As God is my witness, I swear by my heart
That this woman knows, she belongѕ to you entirely

Mary Magdalene, Mary Magdalene
Ah… Mary Magdаlene
Ah…
