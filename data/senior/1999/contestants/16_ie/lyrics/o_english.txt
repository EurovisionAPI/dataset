When you need me

And you would always be there
In everything I'd do
But the fool that I am
Never tried to understand

When you needed someone
To help you through the rain
But this child inside of me
Never let me feel your pain

And how I've let it all just slip away
And now I'm wishing for yesterday

Don't you go on your own
Don't leave me here alone
'Cause I'll be there
Yes, I swear
When you need me I'll be there
Don't you go
I'm on my own
Don't you go

You've been my inspiration
All along the way
But I can see it in your eyes
Well, there's no more yesterday

But I will find my way back
No matter what it takes
For the first time I can see
The love you lost on me

Don't you go on your own
Don't leave me here alone
'Cause I'll be there
Yes, I swear
When you need me I'll be there
Don't you go, no, no

And now I've let it all just slip away
But the fool, the fool's inside of me

Don't you go on your own
Don't leave me here alone
'Cause I'll be there
Yes, I ѕweаr
When you need me I'll be there
Don't you go
I'm on my own
Don't you go
