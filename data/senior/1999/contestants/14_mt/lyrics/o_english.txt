Believe 'n Peace

Take it, use it
Make me, prove it
However it might sound
I'm still the one
Who sticks around
When you're shut down
To the ground
Out on the run

Take me as I am
I'm here for you
I'm everywhere
I'm sure you know
I'm hanging there
For you to hold

I believe in love
It's for everyone
I believe in peace
It's for you to keep
I believe in (believe in)
Believe in (believe in)
It's right here

I believe in fun
Not the only one
I believe in me
This is what you see
I believe in (believe in)
Believe in (believe in)
It's right here

Take it, use it
Make me, prove it
Time will pass and die
Unlike me
I'm here to try
And make you smile
And realize
I'm not shy

Take me as I am
I'm here for you
I'm everywhere
I'm sure you know
I'm hanging there
For you to hold

I believe in love
It's for everyone
I believe in peace
It's for you to keep
I believe in (believe in)
Believe in (believe in)
It's right here

I believe in fun
Not the only one (baby)
I believe in me
This is what you see
I believe in (believe in)
Believe in (believe in)
It's right here

I believe in love
It's for everyone
I believe in peace
It's for you to keep
I believe in (believe in)
Believe in (believe in)
It's right here

I believe in fun
Not the only one (baby)
I believe in me (oh, baby)
This is whаt you see
I believe in (believe in)
Believe in (believe in)
It's right here

I believe in love
Believe in love
It'ѕ right here
