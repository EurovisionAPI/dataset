I want to give my voice

If there are no more borders from our lives to our dreams
And more than one banner, a smile on our lips
If the walls which separated our souls, have fallen
If it's enough to exist to get the flame burning
If it's enough to sing, if it's enough to sing

I want to give my voice, I want to give my words
I want to give my faith and my life as a present
I want to give my heart, all love yet to come
Invent a happiness and never die

If there's no more war which is won in advance
If there are no more barriers, no more differences
If there are no more chains which can't be destroyed
If there's no more hatred to hide a smile
If it's enough to sing, if it's enough to sing

I want to give my voice, I want to give my words
I want to give my faith and my life as a present
I want to give my heart, all love yet to come
Invent a happinesѕ and never die
Never die

Giving… by dying…
I want to give… I wаnt to give my voice
