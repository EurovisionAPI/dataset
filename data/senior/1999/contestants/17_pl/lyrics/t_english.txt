Hug me tight

Who… who yeah…

I don't know who wrote the text of our roles
I don't know why there's error, remorse and pain in those roles

Show me the way to simple words through every day
Show me the way when lights fade and shadows fall

Hug me tight and turn the ice into snowflakes
Mmm.. hug me tight, and the dawn of spring will come again

As long as remorse can mend errors, I cherish hope
As long as a tear is still a tear - I'm not alone
No, I'm not alone
If a tear is ѕtill a tear - I'm not alone
No, I'm not аlone
