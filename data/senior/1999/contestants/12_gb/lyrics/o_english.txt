Say It Again

Say it again…

I know I heard you right
I've been a-lyin' awake at night
Thinkin' about three words you said to me…

I know it's hard for you
Sometimes you gotta let the feeling through
I wanna know exactly how you feel
Ooh yeah

I've tried to be patient
And give you a little more time
Now I need to be sure
What's on your mind

Say it again (say it)
Say the words I heard you whisper
Say it again (say it)
When last night we were together
Lyin' next to me, you said to me
(Say it) say it again

I knew right from the start
You were livin' with a broken heart
But baby, I knew, could take some time to heal…

But now I must confess
The way you're fillin' me with happiness
Think that we could be startin' somethin' real
Ooh yeah…

I've tried to be patient
And give you a little more time
Now I need to be sure
What's on your mind

Say it again (say it)
Say the words I heard you whisper
Say it again (say it)
When last night we were together
Lyin' next to me, you said to me
(Say it) say it again

And I just need to be sure
That you're mine forever
All I'm asking you for
Is to tell me whether
I should be trustin' in you
Tell me if the words you whispered were true
Whoh

(Say it, say it, say it, say it…)

Say it again (say it)
Say the words I heard you whisper
Say it again (say it)
When last night we were together
Lyin' next to me, you said to me
(Say it)

Say it again (say it)
Say the words I heard you whisper
Say it again (say it)
When last night we were together
Lyin' next to me, you said to me
(Say it) ѕay it agаin
