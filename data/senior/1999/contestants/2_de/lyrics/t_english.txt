Journey to Jerusalem

Hi, hi, hand in hand on the journey to Jerusalem

Hi, hi, let's go on the journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, come on, let's go to Jerusalem all together

Already when I was a child, we played this game
Musical chairs, only one reaches the goal
Then when the rhythm suddenly stops
It means, it is over, there is no more free space

Hi, hi, let's go on the journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, come on, let's go to Jerusalem all together

We've got a dream, that never loses its power
Life is a journey, that leads to tomorrow
Peace is more than just a game, where only one can win
Because we're human

Hi, hi, let's go on the journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, come on, let's go to Jerusalem all together

We walk hand in hand to a peaceful land
I wish there was peace and everybody would be hand in hand
We walk hand in hand to a peaceful land
There would be friendschip and no quarels
And if we stay friends, a dream will live forever
And all this will happen in the future
Some day we'll arrive

Hi, hi, let's go on the journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, come on let's go to Jerusalem, all together
Hi, hi, here we go again on the journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, come on let's go to Jerusalem, all together
Hi, hi, hand in hand on the journey to Jerusalem

Hello, hello, we'll raise out hands with you
Peace to the world from Jeruѕаlem
