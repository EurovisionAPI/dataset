For A Thousand Years

Teardrops in my eyes, a dance of glistening rain
Falling from the sky, a carpet of the stars
Clouds of tenderness are fleeing in the light
Now it's here, the light for a thousand years

I tremble in your eyes, I tremble in your palms
Lie inside you deep, in dreams of yours I sleep
Caress you with my eyes and love you with my hands
Yes, I feel the light for a thousand years

I know you are my love
A touch, a kiss, your heart is mine
I know the light is always here
We kiss each other in its shine

I tremble in your eyes, I tremble in your palms
Lie inside you deep, in dreams of yours I sleep
Caress you with my eyes and love you with my hands
Yes, I feel the light for a thousand years

I know you are my love
A touch, a kiss, your heart is mine
I know the light is always here
We kiss eаch other in its ѕhine
