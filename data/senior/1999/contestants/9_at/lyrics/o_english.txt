Reflection

When I'm sad, I need a shoulder to cry on
When I'm bad, you know that I am better
When you're gone, you're the one that I'm thinking of
When I come, it's to you that I run

There's no need to be lonely
I'll be there everytime for you
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?
Well, sometimes memories will have to do

But don't you recognise me?
Oh… I'm the one that you have seen
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes

They say it's a long way to heaven
But they're wrong, 'cause heaven is you
If I fall from grace everlasting
There you are to make everything new

We can fly forever
Wrap yourself around my emotions
It's only getting better and better
Don't ever think to doubt my devotion

But don't you recognise me?
Oh… I'm the one that you have seen
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes, the reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes, the reflection in your eyes

Oh… reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes

But don't you recognise me?
Oh… I'm the one that you hаve seen
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes, the reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes, reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyeѕ
