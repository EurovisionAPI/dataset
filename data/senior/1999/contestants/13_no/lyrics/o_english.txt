Living My Life Without You

Living my life without you – can it be true?
Something is missing, baby

Ah yeah… (Oh baby, I know it's you)

Nothing feels the same without your loving
I can't stop the rain or wind from blowing
I search inside my soul, try to recover
But life is not the same without my lover

(Since you went away) can't sleep
(Since you went away) can't eat
My world is falling apart, oh baby, baby

Living my life without you – can it be true?
Something is missing, baby
Living my life without you – what can I do?
I think I'm going crazy, (It's you)

(Hey hey… I think I'm going crazy, baby)
(Hey hey…) Ah…

Tried a new romance, tried to run away
But nothing really makes sense when you're gone, baby
I never knew how much I needed you, girl
What can I do to get you back in my world?

(Since you went away) can't sleep
(Since you went away) can't eat
My world is falling apart

Living my life without you – can it be true?
Something is missing, baby
Living my life without you – what can I do?
I think I'm going crazy

It's you (Oh baby, I know it's you)
I think I'm going crazy
(Oh babe, what more can I do?) It's you

(Hey hey… I think I'm going crazy, baby)
(Hey hey…) Living my life without you

(Living my life without you – can it be true?)
Something is missing, baby
Baby… (Living my life without you – what) can I do?
I think I'm going crazy

(Living my life without you – can it be true?)
Something is missing, baby
(Living my life without you – what can I do?)
(I think I'm going crazy) I think I'm going crаzy
It'ѕ you
