One Good Reason

You know there never was a doubt in my mind
You only have to follow and learn how to read the signs
A heartache always seems so easy to find
But I will never let go, I wanna see what this love has to hide
We'll just have to face it, rearrange and place it
I'll never let love pass us by

Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say: "I love you forever", say you will, say you do
Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say: "I love you forever", say you will, say: "I do"

You know there never was a cloud in my eye
All we have is one chance to reach out for the clear blue skies
We'll just have to face it, rearrange and place it
I'll never let love pass us by

Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say: "I love you forever", say you will, say you do
Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say: "I love you forever", say you will, say: "I do"

(And then the heart…)
The heart gets stronger with every step that we take
(From the moment…)
From the moment we go to sleep till the time that we awake
(I won't let…)
I won't let anybody lead us astray
(And then the line…)
And then the line from me to you will never break or fade away

Give me one good reason and I will give you two
I love you forever, yes, I will, baby, I do

Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say: "I love you forever", say you will, say you do
Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say: "I love you forever", say you will, ѕay: "I do"

Sаy: "I do"
