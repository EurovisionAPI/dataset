It will be love

The moon lights dimly in the city
And if you can bear with the scene
Your eyes have taken two drops
From the morning rain

Take the stars of the sky
Embellish his glance
Touch the flower of the lotus
Call his name, and it will be love

Some star lights dimly in the city
And you remained to live, yes, to live
To the first of your heart's summer
Into the hugs of Sunday

Take the stars of the sky
Embellish his glance
Touch the flower of the lotus
Call his name

(But don't ask), it will be love
But don't ask, it will be love

(Take the stars of the sky)
Embellish his glance
Touch the flower of the lotuѕ
Call аnd it will be love
It will be love
(It will be love, it will be love, it will be love)
