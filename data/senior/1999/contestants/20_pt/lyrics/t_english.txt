How everything began

Who is going to tell me how it all began?
My life makes no sense now
I know there won't be any way of seeing you
I don't know for what reason you left

I don't want to harm you, I never knew how to see
What you imagined for yourself

Give me your hand, don't lie
Remember your eyes are crystals
Please, don't tell me you won't leave
Because I always know where you go

There's no reason anymore, to live without the passion
That torments me and chases me every hour

So without wanting it, I caused harm, I never knew how to see
What you imagined for yourself

Give me your hand, don't lie
Remember your eyes are crystals
Please don't tell me you won't leave
Because I always know where you go

Give me your hand, don't lie
Remember your eyes are crystalѕ
Give me your hаnd
