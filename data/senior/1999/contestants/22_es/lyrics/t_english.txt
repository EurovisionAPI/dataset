I don't want to listen

You've been hiding the truth for a long time
Your plain naivety betrays you when you speak
Who are you trying to fool?

I saw two shadows going out of a door
I followed the steps as an accomplice of the darkness
Hard reality, oh yeah
I felt like dying when I saw her embracing you

No, I don't want to listen
To your voice whispering that you have loved me
I know what the truth is
I trusted in you and you've lied to me

Now you say that it was a confusion
Only jealousy, the consequence of my imagination
Broke my life in two
Oh yeah, I felt like dying when I saw her embracing you

No, I don't want to listen
To your voice whispering that you have loved me
I know what the truth is
I trusted in you and you've lied to me

(No) No
(I don't want to listen) I don't want to listen
(To your voice whispering) Whispering
(That you have loved me)
I know what the truth is
I trusted in you and you've lied to me

I don't wаnt to liѕten
