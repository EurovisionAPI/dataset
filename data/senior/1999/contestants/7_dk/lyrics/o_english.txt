This Time

(This time I mean it, oh baby)

I don't know what it's all about, but I'm startin' to figure out
Simple songs on the radio kinda colour the way I go

Every song holds an inner key to my dreams and my fantasy
Defences down and suddenly all your love comes back to me

And this time I mean it, oh baby, this time I mean it and now
You got me goin' so crazy even though I don't know how
Tried it before but we never happened, we just gotta try it again
Well, this time I mean it, oh baby, I'm in love with you again

Oh… I know what was said and done, it's been hard just to carry on
The sweetest love left a bitter taste, who's to say it was all a waste?

Mmm… 'cause in each quarrel, in every fight, there's a lesson 'bout wrong and right
Oh… looking back, I'm sure to say that we learned from yesterday

So this time I mean it, oh baby, this time I mean it and now
You got me goin' so crazy even though I don't know how
We tried it before but we never happened, we just gotta try it again
Well, this time I mean it, oh baby, I'm in love with you again

Thiѕ time I mean it, oh baby, I'm in love with you agаin
