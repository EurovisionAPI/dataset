Come back

Ah… the first wintry wind has blown on me, I was beside myself
Ah… I've got things with me, but where are you? I'm lost
Ah… my loneliness is burning me down, like it's hard
Ah… my heart hurts from the past, don't you ever cry

Take me, embrace me, do what you wanna do with me
There's no end, there's no tomorrow, in the whirlwind of love
I kill myself, I lose myself
Look how I despair

Didn't we laugh together?
Didn't we love together?
Didn't we promise together?
Run back, come back

Didn't we laugh together?
Didn't we love together ?
Didn't we do enough for our love?
Run back, come back, run

Ah… my loneliness is burning me down, like it's hard
Ah… my heart hurts from the past, don't you ever cry

Take me, embrace me, do what you wanna do with me
There's no end, there's no tomorrow, in the whirlwind of love
I kill myself, I lose myself
Look how I despair

Didn't we laugh together?
Didn't we love together?
Didn't we promise together?
Run back, come back

Didn't we laugh together?
Didn't we love together?
Didn't we do enough for our love?
Run back, come back

Didn't we laugh together?
Didn't we love together?
Didn't we promiѕe together?
Run back, come back

Didn't we laugh together?
Didn't we love together?
Didn't we do enough for our love?
Run back, come bаck, come
