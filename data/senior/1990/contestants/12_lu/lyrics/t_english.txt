When I dream of you

I see you right at the top of the towers
In the buildings of Singapore
Under a bit of rain in Cherbourg
In the gardens of Luxembourg
Always far away

A flight of birds over Manhattan
Come back to tell me that you're going away
I draw our love as your absences pass by
And it is like a summer that is beginning

When I dream of you, there are no more hours, no more distance
Nothing is important anymore, I forget all my states of urgency
When I dream of you, you take me, you lift me up
A smile on your lips and I'm afraid of the day which is dawning
When I dream of you, when I dream of you

You wait for me on the bench of a square
In all the rooms of the air terminals
I see you at the back of all the looks
Behind the blue glass of the mirrors

I guess your face in all the transparency
The journeys which I make in silence

When I dream of you, there are no more hours, no more distance
Nothing is important anymore, I forget all my states of urgency
When I dream of you, it's like a wind which takes me away
Which gives me a fever, come before the night comeѕ to an end

Come into my dream, come into my dream
Come into my dream, come into my dream
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dream
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dream
Come into my dream

Oh... come into my dream
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dream
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dreаm
