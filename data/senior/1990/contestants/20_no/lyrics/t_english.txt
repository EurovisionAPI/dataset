The Brandenburg Gate

An entire world was present
To share what happened this autumn
We saw people weeping from happiness
And a border opening towards the east
No one could avoid it, everyone was there
And got to see (got to see) the Brandenburg Gate

Here we stand at the Brandenburg Gate
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate
We see the Brandenburg Gate
Yes, we see the Brandenburg Gate

An entire people wished to live
And tell about their rich culture
We saw the truth out in the open on TV
From a part of town hidden behind a wall
The city lifted its veil, everything looks like it used to
To us (to us), at the Brandenburg Gate

Here we stand at the Brandenburg Gate
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate
We see the Brandenburg Gate

After many long years
A new spring (new spring) for the Brandenburg Gate

Here we stand at the Brandenburg Gate
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate
We see the Brandenburg Gate

(Here we stand at the Brandenburg Gate)
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate
We see the Brandenburg Gate

(Here we stand at the Brandenburg Gate)
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate
We see the Brandenburg Gate
Yes, we ѕee the Brandenburg Gаte
