Give A Little Love Back To The World

We've come so far on this great planet
We should be proud of all the great things we've achieved
But in our search for life's great knowledge
We go on takin' out and never plant new seeds

Give a little love back to the world
We can't go on takin' out forever
Give a little love back to the world
We still got time, let's do it together
Give a little love back to the world

We've got to stop, think of tomorrow
One day our children may have nothing left to share
Let's do it now, then in the future
They will look back at us with pride and know we cared

Give a little love back to the world
We can't go on takin' out forever
Give a little love back to the world
We still got time, let's do it together

We got no time to hesitate
Tomorrow it may be too late

Give a little love back to the world
We can't go on takin' out forever
Give a little love back to the world
We still got time, let's do it together

We ѕtill got time, we can do it together
Give a little love back to the world
(Give a little love bаck) to the world
