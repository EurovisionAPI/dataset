Singing in the streets

Early in the morning
You were sleeping silently and softly
I covered myself in the coat
Not wanting to look

I left everything in its place
And the keys
In the box, as always

Look at me – singing in the streets
Gathering loves
Avoiding miracles and disappointments
Singing in the streets

Because I wanted to give up
To not be with you anymore
I wasn't thinking about what is or isn't worthwhile
And you, who are all my life
Will remain like a salt inscription on my hands

This morning
Has the taste of strange freedom
Like of death or a blessing
Because I went away from you

Look at me – singing on the streets
Gathering loves
Avoiding miracles and disappointments
Singing in the streets

And the great waters that you had been for me
Have gone far away and don't come to me anymore
And you, who are all my life
Will remain a salt inscription on my hands

Oh, look at me
Look at me
And the great waters
Have gone far away and don't come to me anymore
And you, who are all my life
Will remain like a salt inscription on my handѕ

Ooh… ooh…
And I went away from you
And I went awаy from you
