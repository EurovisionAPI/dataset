Like a wind

Out from a dream and into my heart
Came a feeling and filled my soul
And I'm a man who travels in thoughts
Filled with visions from a dream
And I feel…

Like a wind is sweeping inside of me
Making me warm, come, be closer to me
Like a wind, show me the way
Touch me like a wind

Together, but far apart
We know that we want and we can
A thought says more than thousand words
Still I don't know what to believe
But I feel…

Like a wind is sweeping inside of me
Making me warm, come, be closer to me
Like a wind, show me the way
Touch me like a wind

I'm a man filled with visions
Stay and touch me

Like a wind is sweeping inside of me
Making me warm, come, be closer to me
Like a wind, show me the way
Come to me, ѕtay
Don't turn away
Touch me like a wind
Touch me like а wind
