My Macedonian woman

When she cries, it's the whole Adriatic
Which floods her eyes
When she sleeps, it's not far from Ohrid
She dreams on the edge of beautiful blue lakes
I see her again, a little girl on bare feet
With rain in her hair
In her house, on the earthen floor
She has left the illusions of all her games

Which she wants to keep to herself
She has the charm of Macedonian women
It's vital that I love her, that I hold her
Whatever you may do or think
But she is more beautiful
Those who don't believe me, let them come
They will see how much I have and that she is mine
You can shout, you can cry, you can laugh
But certainly not at her

When she sleeps, it's at the bottom of the hill
That she does with my body what she wants to
It's a sunflower that is emigrated into the vines
With a heart of stone, and making flames of a fire
A gipsy cry hidden in her murmurs
She lives love without denial
When she fights from the top of her wounds
She pretends everything
She mocks the gods

Too many desire her
She has the charm of Macedonian women
It's vital that I love her, that I hold her
Whatever you may do or think
But she is more beautiful
Those who don't believe me let them come
They will see how much I have and that she is mine
You can ѕhout, you can cry, you can laugh
But certainly not аt her
