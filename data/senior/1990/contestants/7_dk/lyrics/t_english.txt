Hello, hello

I look at my watch, I'm sure you're home by now
So I run down the stairs to call you
But in the phone box a guy is standing with coins in his hand
He takes more out of his pocket, as he scowls at me

Then it's free, I dial the number and get the connection
But it's only your answering machine that answers

I say: Hello, hello
I know you're home
Couldn't you answer your phone?
Hello, hello
I listen to your voice
But when the tape runs out, nobody's ever there

The bells of the town hall are ringing and here I stand freezing
I'm tired of smart guys, who just want to impress
I've got a cold, I blow my nose, walk around sneezing
And can hardly control my temper anymore

I take the receiver, but I'm still being made a fool of
For it's your stupid machine that answers

I say: Hello, hello
I know you're home
Couldn't you answer your phone?
Hello, hello
I listen to your voice
But when the tape runs out, nobody's ever there

I feed the phone with the last coin I've got
Your machine remains the only to answer

I say: Hello, hello
I know you're home
Couldn't you answer your phone?
Hello, hello
I listen to your voice
But when the tape runs out, nobody's ever there

I say: Hello, hello
I knew you were home
It was nice that you could answer your phone
Hello, hello
I listen to your voice
Even if the tape runs out, there's still someone there
It was nice that you could аnѕwer your phone
