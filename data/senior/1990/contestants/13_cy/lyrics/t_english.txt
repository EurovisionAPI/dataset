You talk too much

I don't know how to love you
I don't know how to say it to you
I don't know what present to give you
Which street I should walk along
Where will my history with you lead me
While I follow you?

You talk too much, you ask for too much
For once find a way
To stop your talking
You talk too much, you ask for too much

I don't know what I should remind you of
Which melody, which rhythm
With music I should make my words alive
Where will my history with you lead me
While I follow you?

You talk too much, you ask for too much
For once find a way
To stop your talking
You talk too much, you ask for too much

So we'd better end it an hour sooner
Let's finish once and for all
It wasn't right to continue
We made lots of mistakes

You talk too much, you ask for too much
For once find a way
To stop your talking
You talk too much, you ask for too much

You talk too much, you ask for too much
For once find a way
To stop your talking
You talk too much, you аѕk for too much
