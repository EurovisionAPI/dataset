Music sounds around the world

It was alone, and nobody wanted it
I looked at it and felt in love with it
It became mine, it was beautiful like never before
the violin played for me this melody

Music sounds around the world
Music, that my violin plays
Music is heard in every house
Music that everybody feels
Music sounds around the world
Music, that my violin plays
Music makes fairy tales come true
Music, so wonderful

It plays in major, when the muse is kissing it
And in minor, when the violin cries
I stand by its side, I don't want to lose it
Want to stand by its side, it is like a part of me

Music sounds around the world
Music, that my violin plays
Music is heard in every house
Music that everybody feels
Music sounds around the world
Music, that my violin plays
Music makes fairy tales come true
Music, so wonderful

Music sounds around the world
Music, that my violin plays
Music is heard in every house
Music that everybody feels
Music sounds around the world
Music, that my violin plays
Music makes fairy tаles come true
Music, ѕo wonderful
