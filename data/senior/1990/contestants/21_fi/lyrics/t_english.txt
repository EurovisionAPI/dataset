Free?

Oo yeah…

Free, if I ask you, you won't say no
Don't we have any freedom
But, if you ask me, what our freedom is
My answer is like this:

Free, which of us are free?
Free to think for ourselves, being honest and proud of yourself, whoa…

Where those that are alike are allowed to join the game, whoa…

Tell me, why all these demands
What make me so weak in front of your outer shell?
Who generates the speed of needs?
Who makes me a slave to publicity?
