Without a purpose

Every night I dance
I wander in the shadows and darkness
I am looking for you in the stars
And in the street music

If I could only steal your dream
And dive into your fever
When you say I love you
And when you go away without a purpose

Too many roads hurt
Too many doors without people and light
You must be somewhere
Forgotten even by yourself

If I could only steal your dream
And dive into your fever
When you say I love you
And when you go away without a purpose

If you can dream the day that is coming in silence
Then you will be strong enough to face the sun
But I know you will cry

And then I will steal your dream
And I will dive into your fever
When you say I love you
And when you go away without а purpoѕe
