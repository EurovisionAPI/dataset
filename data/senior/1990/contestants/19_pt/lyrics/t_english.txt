There's always someone

Ooh…

Always, there's always someone
Who still doesn't have as much as we do
Always, there's always someone
In the corner of the world who also dreams

Always, there's always someone
Who still doesn't have as much as we do
Always, there's always someone
In the corner of the world who also dreams

Life was running in front of us
No colours and harmony
A step was a wall that silenced the voice
And truth meant nothing
How many moments did we lose?
Afraid of life, the dream was in vain, aha…

Always, there's always someone
Who still doesn't have as much as we do
Always, there's always someone
In the corner of the world who also dreams

The voices of the wind and the waves of the sea
Brought this new day
Now we came without having to dream
Moments of mad joy
Let's sing together without looking backwards
Nothing can stop love and peace

Always, there's always someone
Who still doesn't have as much as we do
Always, there's always someone
In the corner of the world who also dreams

Always, there's always someone
Who still doesn't have as much as we do
Always, there's always someone
In the corner of the world who also dreams

Always, there's alwаys ѕomeone
