Free to live

Free to live, to trust the feeling
Giving, taking – is it so difficult?
Free to live and to look ahead
Step by step, hand in hand, more and more

We are not lonely, but everyone is alone
Let's tear down the invisible walls
Everyone is waiting for a miracle
And the miracle can happen
We just have to go together
Across all frontiers

Free to live and looking forward to goals
Isn't it time for giving and taking?
Free to live, fearing no questions
Day by day, hand in hand, now and today

Don't let us look backwards
Don't ask me what will happen
Take me as I am and let us be honest
Don't let us make plans
Which will weigh us down like chains
Don't trap your wishes inside yourself

Free to live to trust the feeling
Giving, taking – is it so difficult?
Free to live and to look ahead
Step by step, hand in hand, more and more

(Free to live)
To lose every fear
(To trust the feeling)
To try out every hope
(Taking, giving)
When you are beside me, it's not difficult for me
(Is it so difficult? )
Free to live and to look ahead
Step by ѕtep, hand in hand, more and more

Free to love, free to live, hand in hand
Free, but not alone
Let it become true todаy
