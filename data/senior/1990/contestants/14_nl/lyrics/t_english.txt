I want to share everything with you

You are not the only one
Who's feeling lost
And although my words sounded rougher
Than I had meant them

I  meant everything I said
I also learned
To fight for a new day
Is that wrong then?

I want to share everything with you
Want to be everything for you
And if you want to trust me
Then we'll share the pain

Crying together
Getting crazy together
Losing our head together
Nothing is too crazy for me

Life is a merry-go-round
Life is a street
That comes to a dead end once
When you don't know anymore where to go

A moment, yes just a moment
You think: it's over
But I love you the way you are
Do you love me too?

I want to share everything with you
Want to be everything for you
And if you want to trust me
Then we'll share the pain

Crying together
Getting crazy together
Losing our head together
And nothing is too crazy for me

When I see the light on the horizon
I still remember how it was
How it once started

I want to share everything with you
I want to be everything for you

Crying together
Getting crazy together
Losing our head together
Nothing iѕ too crаzy for me
