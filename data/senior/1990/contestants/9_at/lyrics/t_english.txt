No walls anymore

Around this time last year
Nobody would have thought
That our desire for freedom
Would take this leap forward

The present time comes quickly
It must at any price
Be more colourful, not just black and white

For our future is just born now
Many languages, many ears

No walls anymore, No walls anywhere 
(No walls anymore)
Let the barriers fall , No walls anymore
No walls anymore

The wind is strong, it increases to gale
Blows someone in the face
The firm hand is broken by the resistance

For our future is just born now
Many languages, many ears

No walls anymore, No walls anywhere 
(No walls anymore)
There are no more walls , No walls anymore

No wallѕ аnymore
