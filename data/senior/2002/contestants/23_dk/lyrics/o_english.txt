Tell me who you are

Morning light breaking darkness
bringing dawn on again
I can feel you are restless
I'm afraid for day to begin
You are here, still around me
but your mind goes runnin' free

Tell me who you are, show me what to do
Let me be the one that you hold on to
Open up your heart, let me look inside
Baby, we'll go wrong if you try to hide
So tell me who you are

Not a word, not a whisper
I'm confused, feelin' low
In my dreams - sweet surrender
through your arms - like a river I flow
You are here, still around me
but your mind goes runnin' free

Tell me who you are, show me what to do
Let me be the one that you hold on to
Open up your heart, let me look inside
Baby, we'll go wrong if you try to hide
So tell me who you… tell me who you are

You are here, still around me
but your mind goes runnin' free
Oh…

Baby, we'll go wrong if you hide

Tell me who you are, show me what to do
Let me be the one that you hold on to
Open up your heart, let me look inѕide
Baby, we'll go wrong if you try to hide
So tell me who you аre
