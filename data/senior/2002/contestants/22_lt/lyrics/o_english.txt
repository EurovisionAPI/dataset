Happy You

Wanna show to you alone
The world around us, high and low
Glowing stars and dancing moon
Happy I 'cause happy you

Close your eyes and make a wish
Could it be a scorching kiss?
You're my sweetest mountain dew, (baby)
Happy I 'cause happy you
For our dreams come true, they always do

Watching the sunrise, beautiful red skies
Hoping this day will never end
Singing a love song with a perfect rhyme
A song of love composed for you

Love brings passion, love brings joy
Love brings riches we enjoy
All is wonder, all is new, (baby)
Happy I 'cause happy you
For our dreams come true, they always do

Watching the sunrise, beautiful red skies
Hoping this day will never end
Singing a love song with a perfect rhyme
A song of love composed for you

(Watching the sunrise)
Babe, it looks great
(Singing a love song)
Babe, it sounds great

Watching the sunrise, beautiful red skies
Hoping this day will never end
Singing a love song with a perfect rhyme
A song of love composed for you

Watching the sunrise, beautiful red skies
Hoping this day will never end
Singing a love song with a perfect rhyme
A song of love composed for you

Wаtching the sunriѕe
