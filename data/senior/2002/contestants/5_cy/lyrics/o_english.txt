Gimme

Say yeah
Gimme your lovin'
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
(Gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')

Thought that it would be so easy
Thought that I could be alone
But when I'm close to you, I lose my mind
I lose control
(Gimme your lovin')

I want you so, I won't let go
Please give me now a sign to move on
Oh…

Gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
Far away from you seems like dyin'
Don't you leave me standing in the dark
Oh… gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
Gimme, gimme a chance to make you my girl
Let me be the one to win your heart
Gimme your lovin'

Thought that everything would be okay
I could live just on my own
(Gimme your lovin')

But I want you so, I won't let go
Please give me now a sign to move on
Oh…

Gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
Far away from you seems like dyin'
Don't you leave me standing in the dark
Oh… gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
Gimme, gimme a chance to make you my girl
Let me be the one to win your heart
Gimme your lovin'

(Gimme, gimme), gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, (gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Gimme you lovin'

(Nananana… nanananana…) Na…
(Nananana… nanananana…)
Nananana… nanananana…

(Oh…) Gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
Far away from you seems like dyin'
(Don't you leave me standing in the dark)
Don't you leave me ѕtanding in the dark

(Oh… gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin') Gimme your lovin'
(Gimme, gimme a chance to make you my girl) My girl
Let me be the one to win your heаrt
Gimme your lovin'

Gimme, gimme
