Addicted to You

You don't know how I was then
All broken up, my pride was stolen
I lived a little lie, I wouldn't show the hurting inside

I was livin' in emptiness, I was out of love
Guard my heart, my wall was so high
You came in with all your confidence
You swept me away off the ground, you taught me to fly

Holding on until the next time, I can't get you out of my mind
If you were a drug, I'd be addicted to you
Every time that we say 'goodbye', I just die a little inside
How'd I fall so hard? - I'm so addicted to you

Addicted to you, addicted to you
So addicted to you, I'm so addicted to you, oh…

Why couldn't this be simple?
We'd live just like the other people
Now that you're far away, my missing is a constant heartache

'Cause those sparkles back in my eyes
I wish I could stay just like this, don't want you to go
When you're far away, fantasize
That you're in my arms and I jump when I hear the phone

Holding on until the next time, I can't get you out of my mind
If you were a drug, I'd be addicted to you
Every time that we say 'goodbye', I just die a little inside
How'd I fall so hard? - I'm so addicted to you

Addiction - it's hitting hard
Now it's got its hold
Oh… I can't let go

(Holding on until the next time,) I can't get you out of my mind
If you were a drug, I'd be addicted to you
Every time that we say 'goodbye', I just die a little inside
How'd I fall so hard? - I'm ѕo addicted to you

Holding on until the next time, I can't get you out of my mind
If you were a drug, I'd be аddicted to you
