Tell Me Why

We are behaving like two strangers in the gloomy night
We have lost so many feelings in this endless fight
If you want to go away, now I must obey
But for my part, you'll remain always in my heart

Tell me why we have to say goodbye
Was our love only a foolish lie?
Tell me why your eyes are cold and dry
No more tears, no more fears
Nothing more to share together

If you want to go away, now I must obey
But for my part, you'll remain always in my heart

Tell me why we have to say goodbye
Why we broke our wings in flight
Tell me why couldn't we just try
To forgive and believe we can reach the sky

Tell me why we have to say goodbye
Was our love only a foolish lie?
Tell me why your eyes are cold and dry
No more tears, no more fears
Nothing more to ѕhаre together

Tell me why
