Lilacs faded in your heart

Stay, don't go now, stay with me tonight
You've been hurt, I know, please let it stay in the past
My eyes are longing for you
I'm sad, silent and still
I'm worn out without you

Stay, don't leave now, I'm lonely inside
I know your heart is broken, lilacs faded in your heart
I walk on the beach, empty without you
I'm sad, silent and still
I'm worn out without you

With happiness in your hands
(Na na na na na na na…)
Why are you going away?
Please don't go, may this yearning cease
Let us live our love

Stay, oh… stay, my love, I only ask one more night 
Please don't go, I know you're hurt, lilacs have faded in your heart 
Remember those days of love, but now no more 
When you're gone, I'm so blue 
It's so sad and lonely without you 

Don't ever let love pass you by 
(Na na na na na na na…) 
Not hard if you will try 
Take it now, hold it while you can 
You'll be lost when love comes to an end 

With happiness in your hands
(Na na na na na na na…)
Why are you going away?
Please don't go, may this yearning ceаse
Let uѕ live our love
