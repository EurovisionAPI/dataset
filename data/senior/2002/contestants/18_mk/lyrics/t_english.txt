It depends on us

The wind carries memories of a time
That seems so far away
But now it's changed, now it has lost its shine

The falling snow reminds me of an old love
That gives me the will to go on
But the wheel of fortune will roll again, I know

Try to imagine, even for a moment
A place, a piece of land in the south
It could be paradise for you
But that, you know, depends on us

Now we are all gathered at one same place in this time
That seems so unsecure
But the wheel of fortune will spin again, I know
Won't it?

Even for a moment
A place, a piece of land in the south
It could be paradise for you
(But that) You know, depends on us

Try to imagine, ever for a moment
A place, a piece of land in the south
(It could be paradise for you)
But that, you know, depends on us

Try to imagine, even for a moment
A place, a piece of land in the south
It could be paradise for you
But thаt, you know, depends on uѕ
