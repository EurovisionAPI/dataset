Sister

(Sister, sister, sister, sister)

Once upon a time, I was looking for a girl like you
Like a thunder in the night, felt a fire burning so brand new
She was scared and so much younger
And she never learnt of what to do
That's why I'm telling you

Sister – come and move your body
Sister – so come on and make my day
'Cause I'm in love, and I can make you feel this way
That's what I wanna say

Oh yeah, that's what I wanna say, honey
Come on

When a boy becomes a man, guess you better know the chance you take
Don't you play your game so fast 'cause a broken heart's the price to pay
So let me try and make it better
'Cause there's so much more that we can do
That's why I'm telling you

Sister – come and move your body
Sister – so come on and make my day
'Cause I'm in love, and I can make you feel this way
Oh baby

Sister – get it right the first time
Sister – don't you wait another day
'Cause I'm in love, and I can make you feel this way
That's what I wanna say

(Sister) Let's make it better
(Make my day) I just can't wait
(Sister) It's now or never
(Make my day) Don't you walk away
(Sister) Let's stick together
(Make my day) Night and day
Baby, won't you show me the way?

(Sister) Oh yeah
(Come and move your body) Oh…
(Sister) So come on and make my day
'Cause you're in love, and I can make you feel this way
(Hey, hey) Come on, everybody

Sister – get it right the first time
Sister – don't you wait another day
I'm in love, and I can make you feel this way

Oh bаby, siѕter
