נדליק ביחד נר





Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts
Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts





Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts
Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts

Light all the candles
Let's light the candles everywhere
Just look at me and take my hand
The heat of love will glow again

Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts
Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts
