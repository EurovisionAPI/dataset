Light a candle (We'll light a candle together)

Sometimes it seems as if there is no hope
And everything looks so dark and unknown
The flowers have yet to bloom in the garden and in the field
And in the evening only the wind blows
So let's light a candle together
Candle…

Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts
Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts

Sometimes it seems as if tomorrow
Won't bring any comfort here to the crying and the sorrow
And the long night goes on without a promise
And the darkness is sharp as a razor
So let's light a candle together
Candle…

Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts
Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts

Light all the candles
Let's light the candles everywhere
Just look at me and take my hand
The heat of love will glow again

Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts
Light a candle, light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark will open our heаrtѕ
