On a pillow for two

Good morning, my heart is smiling
You I don't want, I only sin with you
Comforting words are not necessary
I don't love you anymore, move away from me, no, no
(Yeah, yeah) 

I have that thing called the heart
Because of you, it's now looking for tears

On a pillow for two made of illusions
The thoughts are far, miles away
Love is on a journey to shatter someone else's dreams

On a pillow for two, I'm alone now
Steps are moving far, miles away
Love is on a journey to shatter someone else's dream
I don't know who he is, but I'll wait for him

(Wala pa pa pa pa… wala pa pa pa pa…)
(Wala pa pa pa pa… wala parapa para pa…)

Welcome, sister, the club is open, sign in 
Take these members, be prepared for crying 
I am sad no more, you took away my lonesome blues 
I was blind and stupid when I spent my dreams on him 
(Yeah, yeah) 

And if I ever, if I ever meet him (No, no) 
No, I will never, I will never want him (Yeah, yeah) 

Fairytales about love – this lady knows so well 
There's no sound of music in the broken bell, yeah 
If someone doesn't care about you, don't be sad and blue 

Fairytales about love – this lady learnt so well 
There's no sound of music in the broken bell, yeah 
If someone doesn't care about you, just don't waѕte your time 
Never, never free – you'd better run away 
(Parapa para pа…)
