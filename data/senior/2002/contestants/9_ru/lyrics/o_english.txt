Northern Girl

In all my wanderings around the world
I met so many kinds of pretty girls
All of them like precious stones sparkling on their own
I found them fiery, tender, bright and sweet
In Rome and Paris, Lisbon and Madrid
But one girl remains for me still a real mystery
I've been thinkin' about you

Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl

We drink the sunset like ruby wine
But still you keep your head and hold the line
Even when you look aside, I admire your pride
We stand together closely, skin to skin
You look forbidding as the Snow Queen
But I hear your secret call 'cause your fortress has no walls
I'm still thinkin' about you

Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl

Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl

And when you ask me tonight why I search for love so, so far
I will hold you and whisper:
You're my Northern Star, guiding star, baby

Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl

Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
(You're my northern girl)
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
(You're my guiding star)
Northern girl, frosty eyeѕ, I wanna melt you, bаby
(Northern girl)
