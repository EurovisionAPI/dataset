Everything I Want

Since you came into my life, I've been touched by happiness
I feel love is all around 'cause there is no more loneliness
And there's one thing that is true
You should know how much I love you

Love is everything I want, love is everything I need
Thinking of the day we met as sign of destiny
Love is everything I want, I believe in you and me
Let me show you what I feel because my love is real

The girl I was, I left behind, incomplete and insecure
Now I got you on my mind and I feel like I've been cured
And there's one thing that is true
You should know how much I love you

Love is everything I want, love is everything I need
Thinking of the day we met as sign of destiny
Love is everything I want, I believe in you and me
Let me show you what I feel because my love is real

(Ah… ah… ah…) Whoa…

(Love is everything I want, love is everything I need)
(Thinking of the day we met as sign of destiny)
Love is everything I want, I believe in you and me
Let me show you what I feel because my love is real

(Love is everything I want, love is everything I need)
(Thinking of the day we met as sign of destiny) Thinking of the day
(Love is everything I want, I believe in you and me)
(Let me show you what I feel) because my love is real
Because my love iѕ reаl
