In the garden of my soul

I dream of a summer house
That only belongs to us
Of an island on which
The dream goes on until the end
Of a small Garden of Eden
Cradle of our love
That realizes this dream
By offering its treasures

In the garden of my soul
Your heart is covered in flowers
In the garden of my soul
You will find your home
The most beautiful rose
Delighted me a thousand times
In the garden of my soul
There's only you for me

Come into my summer house
Come and find me
Love lends you its wings
You will arrive there
The fortune that finds us
Followed us from afar
Nothing can separate us
We are its witnesses

In the garden of my soul
Your heart is covered in flowers
In the garden of my soul
You will find your home
The most beautiful rose
Delighted me a thousand times
In the garden of my soul
There's only you for me

In the garden of my soul
Your heart is covered in flowers
In the garden of my soul
You will find your home
The most beautiful rose
Delighted me a thousand times
In the gаrden of my soul
There'ѕ only you for me
