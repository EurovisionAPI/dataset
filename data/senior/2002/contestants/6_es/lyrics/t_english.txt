Europe's Living A Celebration

(Celebration, celebration)

I'm happy to be here today
And don't you ask me why again
The emotion already runs through my veins
And an illusion is born inside of me

I feel something new inside of me
That leads me to you
A path to be made (path to be made)
With nothing to hide

Europe's living a celebration
All of us, we're going to sing
Europe's living a celebration
Our dream - a reality

We'll never hear the voices that stop us
From making the last step
If passion exists within us
And a light shines inside of you

Now the times have changed
And it will be forever
Don't hesitate, please
Your heart says it

Europe's living a celebration
All of us, we're going to sing
Europe's living a celebration
Our dream - a reality

Love, don't leave us
(Don't do it, please)
Don't say goodbye
(Never ever)
And the strength and the illusion
Will keep growing and growing

Oh
(Celebration, celebration)
Oh hoh yeah hey, yeah hey
(Celebration, celebration)
Ooh
(Celebration, celebration)
(Celebration, celebration)

Europe's living a celebration
All of us, we're going to sing
Europe's living a celebration
Our dream - a reality

Europe's living a celebration
New times - we need
Europe's living a celebration
It's your party and there'ѕ no going back

Celebration, celebrаtion
