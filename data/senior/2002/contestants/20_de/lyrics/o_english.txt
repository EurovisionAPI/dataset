I can't live without music

You're my song in the morning, you're the rhythm of my heartbeat at night
And the sound of love I hear in your voice keeps on touching me deep inside
You are the air that I breathe and the gentle tune of whisperin' trees
You're the only melody that's in my soul and in my mind all the time

I can't live without music, only you keep me goin' along
I can't live without music and the power that's deep in your song
You're the one and only thing I couldn't do without
Makes me wanna sing and dance and shout

We can't live without music, we can't live without music
It's a rainbow in the night, turns darkness into light
It's everything we really need
We can't live without music, and if ever we lose it
That's when everybody, just everybody, starts getting the blues
(We can't live without music) 'cause it's freedom to me and to you

So let the music touch your heart in times when men are worlds apart
'Cause only love can heal the dream that's hidden in our souls
And hand in hand we'll walk along, we'll be united by a peaceful song
And we'll live all together

(We can't live without music, we can't live without music)
I can't live without music, I can't live without music
And if anybody, just anybody, is asking me why
Music makes me feel like flyin', giveѕ me hope when I'm а-cryin'
I believe without it I would die
