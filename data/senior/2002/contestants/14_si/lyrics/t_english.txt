But, but, but in the end, you'll choose only one

I can offer you only love
One and only hope
Just look me in the eyes, and you're easily carefree
I know you feel the same

One and only hope
Just look me in the eyes, and you're easily carefree
(Just look me in the eyes, and you're easily carefree)
I know you feel the same
