Never let it go

(Don't ever stop)
All right, girls
(Are you shakin'?)
Here we go

Surrounded by sharp lookin' eyes, dancin' in a fever
Forgettin' all the words of advise, movin' in and closer
What a life we have, what a life we live
And it's smiling right at us
What a life we share, gonna get it there

So never let it go, never stop till you know
We'll be reachin' for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat, up and down in the heat
We'll be shakin', shakin'

So never let it go, never stop till you know
We'll be reachin' for the top tonight
And when the night is over, I'll take you in my arms now

Blinded by the scent of your love, sailing on this feeling
And my mind is high up above, I don't know if I'm dreaming
What a life we have, what a life we live
And it's smiling right at us
What a life we share, gonna get it there

So never let it go, never stop till you know
We'll be reachin' for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat, up and down in the heat
We'll be shakin', shakin'
(We'll be shakin')

So never let it go, never stop till you know
We'll be reachin' for the top tonight
(We will reach the top)
Surrender to the beat, up and down in the heat
We'll be shakin', shakin'

What a life we have, what a life we live
What a life we share, gonna get it there

So never let it go, never stop till you know
We'll be reachin' for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat, up and down in the heat
We'll be shakin', shakin'
(Shakin', shakin', shakin', shakin')

So never let it go, never stop till you know
We'll be reachin' for the top tonight
And when the night is over, I'll take you in my arms now

So never let it go, never stop till you know
We'll be reachin' for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat, up and down in the heat
We'll be shakin', shakin'
(Shakin', shakin', shakin', shаkin')

So never let it go, never ѕtop
