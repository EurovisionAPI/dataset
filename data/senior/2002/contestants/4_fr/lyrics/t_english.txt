It takes time (I will fight for that)

It takes time to learn how to smile
To learn how to grow in the middle of a fight
It takes time to hang without much ado
The ideals that are too short , but we're not there yet

I've fought for that, I've clasped in my voice
All those words that are frightening when we can't hear them
I've fought for that, I've clasped in my arms
All those crying women that we can't see

It takes time, that's what they say to us, they say
They talk and they write, and the war sells
It takes time, no, it takes a strong will
Mr Ghandi has died, will he be dead for a long time?

I would fight for that, here and now
I don't have the time, I only have one life in front of me
I will fight for that, how will I fight
Peace is only a child that doesn't walk straight

I'm only a little soldier with no weapon but my voice
But I'll cry for you, my dove for you
I'm only a little soldier, now and over there
But a thousand voices will shout it with me

I will fight for that here and now
I hear the wind rising, but who will get up?
I will fight for that, how will I fight
They say that it takes time, but a thousаnd voices
Will ѕhout it with me
