Hello, Hello

One, only one word is enough
Happiness will give shine back to your eye
Oh… oh… chin up and don't think of the end

One, only one word is enough (Shoobee-doo-a)
Everything would be like before (Shoobee-doo-a)
Oh… oh… but no one knows where he is

Hello, hello, hello, hello (Who's there?)
All the stories, very weird, does anyone know
Where you are now?
Hello, hello, hello, hello (Wrong number)
I know well he's there, alone
I love him
