Here Today, Gone Tomorrow

Lala lalalala… la lalalala… la lalalala…
La lalalala… la lalalala… la lalalala…

Hey baby, tell me please
How can you come back to me as cool as a breeze?
You can fool some people with your big brown eyes
But I'm the one who knows that you've been telling me lies
You tell me that you love me so
Then you pack up and off you go

Here today, gone tomorrow
One day love, next day sorrow
First you give, then you borrow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Baby, love me all of the time
Or I don't really wanna know

Here today, gone tomorrow
One day love, next day sorrow
First you give, then you borrow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Baby, give me all of your love
Or I don't really wanna know

Lala lalalala… la lalalala… la lalalala…
La lalalala… la lalalala… la lalalala…

Hey baby, would it be nice
If I paid attention to my friends' advice?
They've been telling me that I should turn you down
'Cause you've another girlfriend on the far side of town
I always hoped when you'd go away
That you would change your rovin' ways
And come back to stay

Here today, gone tomorrow
One day love, next day sorrow
First you give, then you borrow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Baby, love me all of the time
Or I don't really wanna know

Here today, gone tomorrow
One day love, next day sorrow
First you give, then you borrow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Baby, give me all of your love
Or I don't really wanna know

Here today, gone tomorrow
One day love, next day sorrow
Firѕt you give, then you borrow
Here todаy, gone tomorrow
