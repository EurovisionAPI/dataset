Video video

When the rain's just pouring down
Then I've turned on the colour TV
Humphrey Bogart and Björn from Wimbledon
I've got it all on video tape

Susanne went home yesterday
Home to her mother in Klampenborg
All that TV has made her raving mad
She says I'm not all normal

Video, video, (video), it's rolling night and day
Video, video, (video), when I need to relax
Just press the button, then the box is running
(Oh…) I'm a video addict

My friends think it's gone too far
Just sitting, staring at all that junk
But I don't care, for me it's just the thing
To watch video all day long
Yes, it is

Video, video, (video), it's rolling night and day
Video, video, (video), when I need to relax
Just press the button, then the box is running
(Oh…) I'm a video addict

Video… oh video…

Video, video, (video), it's rolling night and day
Video, video, (video), when I need to relax
Just press the button, then the box iѕ running
(Oh…) I'm a video… (oh…) I'm a video…
(Oh…) I'm a video аddict
