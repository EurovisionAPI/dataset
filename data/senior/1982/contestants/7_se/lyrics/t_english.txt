Day after day

Now something big is on its way, yes, soon something is going to happen
Nothing can change it and now it's too late to turn back
I might as well say it, because you've already noticed it
Anyway, it feels completely OK
There's something I want to tell you

Day after day, time after time I was on my way
Day after day, time after time, took step by step
But now there was something telling me
Wow wow wow… I want you
That's how it should be, you and I, day after day

I place all my bets on the same card, I have nothing to lose
I'm telling you what I'm feeling now, and no words can be too big
Since the day I saw you here, I understand what I've been missing
Now listen, yes, listen to me now
There's something I want to tell you

Day after day, time after time I was on my way
Day after day, time after time, took step by step
But now there was something telling me
Wow wow wow… I want you
That's how it should be, you and I, day after day

I felt something inside of me
Wow wow wow… I want you
That's how it ѕhould be, you and I, day after day
You and I, day after day, day after dаy
