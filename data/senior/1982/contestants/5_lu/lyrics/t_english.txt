Run after time

Run after time, run after money
Run without stopping, if you want to win
Run after glory, go towards victory
Run without looking at the ones who have fallen

(Run after time) If I have to run all the time
(Run after money) What could I do with the money?
(Run without stopping) And how to catch time
(If you want to win) If I don't see it passing by?

(Run after glory) Glory is not very glorious
(Go towards victory) It vanishes in the mirrors
(Run without looking) But often to reach it
(At the ones who have fallen) You don't dare to look at yourself anymore

Run from heart to heart (From heart to heart)
Run towards happiness (Towards happiness)
There is too much love (There is too much love)
To live one love (To live one love)

Run without worrying (Without worrying)
About the harm you do (About the harm you do)
You must be mad (Be mad)
To live on your knees

(Run from heart to heart) My heart isn't strong enough
(Run towards happiness) To beat records
(There is too much love) And even if it's a bit too big
(To live one love) A single love will fit into it

(Run without worrying) I never knew hatred
(About the harm you do) I'm unable to grieve
(You must be mad) And if there exist other mad people
(To live on your kneeѕ) Then I want to meet them

Run after time, I've got time
On the honour table, you burn your heart

La lalalala… la lalalala…
You want to win, I'm going to love

(La lalalala… la lalalala…) Ah…
(La lalalala… lalala lala…) Ah…
(La lalalala… la lalalala…) Ah…
(La lalalala… lalala lalа…) Ah…
