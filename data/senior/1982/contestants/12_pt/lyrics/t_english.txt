Very good

Hey, hey, hey, hey

One in the morning, a touch, a sparkle in your glance
Two in the morning, two fingers of magic
On the count of three, who knows where this will end?
Four in the morning, falling a beautiful moonlight
A drop too many and I'm slipping on the floor

One in the morning, hey, very good
Two in the morning, very good
Three o'clock already, hey, very good
Four in the morning, very good
Five in the morning, hey, very good
Six o'clock already, very good
Seven in the morning, hey, very good
Eight in the morning, very good
Breakfast for two
Without knowing what's coming next
Very good

Five in the morning, I'm following my heart
Half past six, striking of madness
Seven in the morning, listening to an old record
Today is the first day of the rest of your life
Too many hours and now there's no way out

One in the morning, hey, very good
Two in the morning, very good
Three o'clock already, hey, very good
Four in the morning, very good
Five in the morning, hey, very good
Six o'clock already, very good
Seven in the morning, hey, very good
Eight in the morning, very good
Breakfast for two
Without knowing what's coming next

One in the morning, hey, very good
Two in the morning, very good
Three o'clock already, hey, very good
Four in the morning, very good
Five in the morning, hey, very good
Six o'clock already, very good
Seven in the morning, hey, very good
Eight in the morning, very good
Breakfast for two
Without knowing whаt'ѕ coming next
Very good, hey
