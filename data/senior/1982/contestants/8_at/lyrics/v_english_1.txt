Honey Bee

You're so sunny, I don't need money
You make life funny, it's twisting and sweet and
So like honey just when it's runny
You know you're good enough to eat

It's a wonder, there's no more thunder
To drag me under and love me off my feet and
You're so handy, as sweet as candy
You know you're good enough to eat

You are my honey bee, as sweet as pie to me
Don't say goodbye to me – what on earth would I do?

I got nothing but sweet, sweet laughing
And turtle-doving all sugary and spice
And you're my sweetness and my completeness
And everything that tastes so nice

I have told you I want to hold you
And never scold you when you are so sweet
And I'm not wasting my honey-tasting
You know you're good enough to eat

You are my honey bee, as sweet as pie to me
Don't say goodbye to me – what on earth would I do?

Whoa… honey bee, keep on spinning me
Find the sweetest way into my heart
Honey bee, keep on spinning me
Never let the sweetness part

Honey bee, keep on spinning me
Find the sweetest way into my heart
Honey bee, keep on spinning me
Never let the sweetness part

You are my honey bee, as sweet as pie to me
Don't say goodbye to me – what on earth would I do?

Whoa… honey bee, keep on spinning me
Find the sweetest way into my heart
Honey bee, keep on spinning me
Never let the sweetness part

Honey bee, keep on spinning me
Find the sweetest way into my heart
Honey bee, keep on spinning me
Never let the sweetness part

Honey bee, keep on spinning me
Find the sweetest way into my heart
Honey bee, keep on spinning me
Never let the sweetness part

Whoa… honey bee, keep on spinning me
Never let the sweetness part
Oh… honey bee, keep on spinning me
Never let the sweetnesѕ pаrt
