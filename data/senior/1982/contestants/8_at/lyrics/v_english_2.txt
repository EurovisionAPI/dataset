Sunday

Today is Sunday, my lovely Sunday
I wish that Sunday could stay like this forever
Every Sunday goes on to Monday
And passes far too soon

Every Sunday, yes, every Sunday
I stay at home and live a day of solitude
Every Sunday I feel like Friday
I'm in Friday and Robinson

Each Sunday brings to me the week's tranquility
I need some rest and then I can live up again

Sunny Sunday, a rainy Sunday
It doesn't matter 'cause Sunday I'm happy
Sunday morning till Sunday evening
I stay right here, in my bed

Every Sunday begins a Monday
And proves on Wednesday it's beautiful till Friday
Then comes Saturday, almost Sunday
And that's when the fun begins

Each Sunday brings to me the week's tranquility
I need some rest and then I can live up again

Whoa… Sunday, I love Sunday
All the week I'm waiting for my glorious Sunday
Sunday, such a sun-day
That's the day that I really love

Sunday, I love Sunday
All the Sunday I'm already waiting for Sunday
Sunday, such a sunny day
Oh, it's the day that I really love

Each Sunday brings to me the week's tranquility
I need some rest and then I can live up again

Whoa… Sunday, I love Sunday
All the week I'm waiting for my glorious Sunday
Sunday, such a sun-day
That's the day that I really love

Sunday, I love Sunday
All the Sunday I'm already waiting for Sunday
Sunday, such a sunny day
Oh, it's the day that I really love

Sunday, such a sunny day
It's the day that I really love, whoa…
Sunday, such a sunny day
It'ѕ the day that I reаlly love
