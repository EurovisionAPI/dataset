Sunday

Today is Sunday, a little Sunday
A fine Sunday, it could be like this forever
Every Sunday, the Sunday's passing
Like always, far too quickly

Every Sunday I'm alone
At home on my little island
And on Sunday I'm always feeling
Like Friday and Robinson

On Sunday I need a little time for myself
Just a little rest, no rush, no watch

Sunny Sunday or rainy Sunday
On every Sunday I feel wonderful
Because from Sunday-morning to Sunday-evening
I'm lying in my four-poster bed

Every Sunday starts on Monday
Is getting good on Wednesday
And lasts then until Friday
And Saturday is nearly Sunday
And the party just begins

On Sunday I need a little time for myself
Just a little rest, no rush, no watch

Sunday, I like Sundays
The whole week long, I'm waiting for Sunday
Sunday, such a sunny day
And is giving me the right vibrations
Sunday, I like Sundays
Every Sunday I'm already looking forward to the next
Sunday, such a sunny day
It has this special something

On Sunday I need a little time for myself
Just a little rest, no rush, no watch

Sunday, I like Sundays
The whole week long, I'm waiting for Sunday
Sunday, such a sunny day
And is giving me the right vibrations
Sunday, I like Sundays
Every Sunday I'm already looking forward to the next
Sunday, such a sunny day
It has this special something

Sunday, I like Sundays
The whole week long, I'm waiting for Sunday
Sunday, such a sunny day
And is giving me the right vibrations

Sunday, such a sunny day
And is giving me the right vibrations
Sunday, such a sunny day
And is giving me the right vibrаtionѕ
