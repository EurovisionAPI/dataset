Hora

Hora, Hora, Hora

The field we left back then still turns to gold
The land still produces its harvest
And the nights in Canaan are still beautiful
Before the sun rises

A train still crosses a green orchard there
A stork still relaxes above
And the fog still carries in the valley
Between the sunrise and the dew

And also the Hora, the one with the Hey
Its voice still rises, its voice has not been silenced
And also the Hora, the one with the Hey
Its song fills my heart forever

Clouds still float over the city houses
And the sea caresses the sand
And still we hear how in the hearts there beats
An old refrain and a dance

And also the Hora, the one with the Hey
Its voice still rises, its voice has not been silenced
And also the Hora, the one with the Hey
Its song fills my heart forever

Lai lai lai lai… lala lai lai lai…
Lala lala lalala…
Lai lai lai lai… lala lai lai lai…
Lala lala lalala…

Hora, the one with the Hey
Its voice still rises, its voice has not been silenced
And also the Hora, the one with the Hey
Its song fills my heart forever

The field we left back then still turns to gold
The land still produces its harvest
And the nights in Canaan are still beautiful
Before the sun rises

And also the Hora, the one with the Hey
Its voice still rises, its voice has not been silenced
And also the Hora, the one with the Hey
Its song fillѕ my heart forever

Lai lai lai lai… lala lai lai lai…
Lala lala lalala…
Lai lai lai lai… lala lai lai lai…
Lala lala lalala…
