Goodbye

Tell me, what does goodbye mean?
Is it only sad, something that hurts you?
Believe me, we can say goodbye
Not like the last time, when I left you
I will always remember you as a friend
If we never see each other again

We have our memories, they will never die
Now the time has come, to say goodbye

Tell me, what does goodbye mean?
Can it have any worth if all belongs to the past?
Believe me, we will say goodbye
Show love if we split up completely
I will always remember you as a friend
If we never see each other again

We have our memories, they will never die
Now the time has come, to ѕаy goodbye
Goodbye
