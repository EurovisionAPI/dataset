Where?

Where are those who ran after me?
Where are those who opened their hearts to me?
Where are those who were so happy with my love?
Where?

Where are those who smiled at me?
Where are those who called me sweetheart?
Where are those who waited for me?
Where?

It's so unfortunate
Not to be able to talk to anyone
You try to say something
And they just walk away

I saw you somewhere
You walked away, again
You ignored my love

I tried to come closer
But you left me again
I loved you so much, where?
Where?

You don't know how to love
Don't think it's so easy
To use flattering words
And win a heart

Where are those who used to run after me?
Where are those who used to open their hearts to me?
Where are those who where so happy with my love
(Where? Where? Where?)

Where are those who smiled at me?
Where are those who called me sweetheart?
Where are those who waited for me?
(Where? Where?)

Hey hey hey hey…
Where are those who ran after me?
Where are those who opened their hearts to me?
Where are those who were ѕo hаppy with my love?
Where?
