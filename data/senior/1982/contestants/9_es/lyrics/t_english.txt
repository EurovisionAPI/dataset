He

Come, I'm free from eight to ten
We can have fun and have a drink
He's like a faithful dog
But I prefer you
Though people say I'm crazy

He acts like a serious man
You're laughing about it
He intends to be my owner
You phone me and forget me
But I prefer you

He forgives me because he's a scrap of good bread
And he treats me with patience
I know that I shouldn't be cruel
That I should tell him I'm not interested in him

He acts like a serious man
You're laughing about it
He intends to be my owner
You phone me and forget me
But I prefer you

He says that I will change
That I have to find him when I settle down
Come, I'm free from eight to ten
Then I have to study
And think about whom I'm interested in

He acts like a serious man
You're laughing about it
He intends to be my owner
You phone me and forget me
But I prefer you

He says that I will change
That I have to find him when I settle down
Come, I'm free from eight to ten
Then I have to study
And think about whom I'm interested in

He acts like a serious man
You're laughing about it
He intendѕ to be my owner
You phone me аnd forget me
But I prefer you
