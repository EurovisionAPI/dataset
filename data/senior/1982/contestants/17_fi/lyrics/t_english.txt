Oversleep

If someone soon throws some nuclear poo here on our Europe
What will you say when we get all the filth on our faces
If someone slings a bomb to your neck you probably won't even notice

(Lullaby, aa… aa… aa… lullaby)
(Lullaby, aa… aa… aa… lullaby)
(Lullaby, aa… aa… aa… lullaby)
(Lullaby, aa… aa… aa… lullaby)

Sleep, sleep, oversleep, it's easier that way
Over-, over-, oversleep, it calms you down

You slept too long dreaming under the skies
You just rub your hair, start negotiating

(Lullaby, aa… aa… aa… lullaby)
(Lullaby, aa… aa… aa… lullaby)

And oversleep, sleep, oversleep, it's easier that way
Over-, over-, oversleep, it calms you down

Now the gang's sitting, taking part in a negotiation follow-up
The brain of science and the rage of the others plot their intrigues
If you don't wake up this time, you won't wake up at all

(Lullaby, aa… aa… aa… lullaby)
(Lullaby, aa… aa… aa… lullaby)
(Lullaby, aa… aa… aa… lullaby)
(Lullaby, aa… aa… aa… lullaby)

Oversleep, sleep, oversleep, it's easier that way
Over-, over-, oversleep, it calms you down

Sleep, sleep, oversleep, it's easier that way
Over-, over-, oversleep, it cаlmѕ you down
