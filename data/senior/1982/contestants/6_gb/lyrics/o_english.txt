One Step Further

One step further and I would have been there

Can't seem to get your attention no matter how I try
I just want you to prefer me to the other guys
So when you looked at me, you only turned away
So I walked up beside you
But I forgot all the things that I planned to say
I don't know if I tried to

I could have taken one step further
And I would have been there
You could have turned around
And hit me and I wouldn't have cared
All this time I didn't get anywhere
I could have taken one step further
And I would have been there

Ain't got the courage to speak when you're sometimes near
Well I can't seem to think of the things that a girl likes to hear
But when I saw you again, you were all alone
So I walked up beside you
But I was too shy to even ask you home
I don't know if I tried to

I could have taken one step further
And I would have been there
You could have turned around
And hit me and I wouldn't have cared
All this time I didn't get anywhere
I could have taken one step further
And I would have been there

If you read my letters or my telegrams
You'd have got around to asking me just who I am
'Cause you know I'm gonna get ya
I'm gonna get ya, I'm gonna get ya

One step further and I would have been there
You could have turned around
And hit me and I wouldn't have cared
All this time I didn't get anywhere
I could have taken one step further
And I would have been…

One step further and I would have been there
You could have turned around
And hit me and I wouldn't have cared
All this time I didn't get anywhere

One step further and I would have been there
You could have turned around
And hit me and I wouldn't have cared
All this time I didn't get anywhere
I could have taken one step further
And I would have been…

(One step further and I would have been there)
I could have tooken one step further
(One step further аnd I would've been there)
One step, one ѕtep
