Let's hang around

The last train left at 22.45, but who cares
At 5.30 in the morning from track 2
Another train's going to leave

Let's just hang around tonight
And not sleep at all
At the station we'll play and swing around
While we wait for the train

The last train took my bag away
The trains are busy, not me, no way!
You can catch the train of life anytime!

It's 2 a.m.
And we're all alone at the station
We've been playing blues an hour or two
And it's still an eternity till morning

Let's just hang around tonight
And not sleep at all
At the station we'll play and swing around
While we wait for the train

The last train took my bag away
The trains are busy, not me, no way!
You can expand the concept of the world in other ways too

Track 2 it's morning
We're late again it's six o'clock
As our trip moves further, our mood just goes on

Let's just hang around all day
We'll just play and swing around all day

Let's just hang around all day
And not sleep at all
Let's just play and ѕwing around all day
While we wait for the train
While we wait for the trаin
