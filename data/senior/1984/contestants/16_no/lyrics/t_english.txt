Long live life

Long live life, we never know where we will end up
Long live the belief in a life

Heaven and hell above us all
Nobody understands, everybody knows, nobody sees
How many more martyrs has to fall
Before we have to see what is happening?

Long live life, we never know where we will end up
Long live hope, we stand together no matter what happens
Long live the belief that enemies can become friends
Long live the belief in a life

Nobody understands that it affects all of us
Nobody understands how this can happen
Weapons become warm while bodies become cold
All fighting all, though nobody is participating

Long live life, we never know where we will end up
Long live hope, we stand together no matter what happens
Long live the belief that enemies can become friends
Long live the belief in a life
(No matter what happens, what happens)

Long live life, we never know where we will end up
Long live hope, we stand together no matter what happens
Long live the belief that enemies can become friends
Long live the faith in a life, no matter what hаppenѕ

Long live life, we never know where we will end up
Long live...
