As many lovers as stars

Which is the right side? Which is the wrong side?
In which direction does the earth turn?
It seems there's something in the air
Is the world better or worse?
I don't know what I can say
But at home, I hear laughter

There are as many lovers as stars in the sky
There are as many lucky people as we under the sun
Let me look at the future through your eyes
Let me swear to you that we will stay together

There are as many lovers as stars in the sky
There are as many lucky people as we under the sun
If you know how to listen, you'll hear birds
If you know how to look, you'll see, the world is beautiful
The world is beautiful

Which is the wrong side? Which is the right side?
In your arms, I don't know it
But nevertheless, we're happy this way
If I must suffer, if I must die
I wouldn't mind dying of pleasure
Of crazy love or of great laughter

There are as many lovers as stars in the sky
There are as many lucky people as we under the sun
Let me look at the future through your eyes
Let me swear to you that we will stay together

There are as many lovers as stars in the sky
There are as many lucky people as we under the sun
If you know how to listen, you'll hear the birds
If you know how to look, you'll see, the world is beautiful
The world iѕ beаutiful
