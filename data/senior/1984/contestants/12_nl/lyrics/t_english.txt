I love you

I love you
Only you
I can't live in a world without you
Wherever I am
I hear your voice
I can't forget you just like that

Take me in your arms again
Let me warm your heart
I want to give you everything
I love you so much

You belong to me
Only to me
Those are the words you once said to me
I'm so alone
Where do I have to go?
Where are the good old days gone to?

Take me in your arms again
Let me warm your heart
I want to give you everything
I love you ѕo much

I love you
Only you
I can't live in а world without you
I love you
