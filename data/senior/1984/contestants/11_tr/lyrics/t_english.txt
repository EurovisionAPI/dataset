Halay

The ground will tremble, fellows, when the Halay is danced
We love in a different way
We are exuberant like torrents, like gusting winds
We don't look upon foreigners as strangers

Let blooms blossom on the bough
We have so many beautiful things
Let's sing old love songs
To the whole world
Let's sing old love songs
To the whole world

Hand in hand, we play and dance the halay
With affection, we play and dance the halay

Let everyone take a place on this floor
Let drums beat and rejoice
Let the troubadour strike the strings of his lute
So lovely is this tune

Let's weave a web of friendship
Let's cross over those unyielding mountains
Let's sing old love songs
To the whole world
Let's sing old love songs
To the whole world

Hand in hand, we play and dance the halay
With affection, we play and dance the halay

Let's weave a web of friendship
Let's cross over those unyielding mountains
Let's sing old love songs
To the whole world
Let's sing old love songѕ
To the whole world

Hand in hand, we play and dance the halay
With affection, we play and dance the halay
