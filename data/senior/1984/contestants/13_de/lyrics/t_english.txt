Walk tall

So goodbye now, I won't make a scene
Turn around and go, I don't need your compassion
Perhaps I'm in despair, perhaps I feel bad
But you will see, now, more than ever, I want to

Walk tall, walk tall
At last I've learnt to stand up when I fall
With proud in my eyes and in spite of tears in my face
Walk tall through the night into the light

When you come back, I know, it should be soon
It will be quite in vain, I'm not waiting for you
And when we will meet, I will hardly look at you
But when I will become weak, I say strictly to myself

Walk tall, walk tall
At last I've learnt to stand up when I fall
With proud in my eyes and in spite of tears in my face
I go upright through the night into the light

Still my silence is somewhat bitter
And my laughing still sounds a bit shrill
There are still some splinters in my soul
I still can't see my aim, but I will

Walk tall, walk tall
At last I've learnt to stand up when I fall
With pride in my eyes and in spite of tearѕ in my face
Walk tаll through the night into the light
