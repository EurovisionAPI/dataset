Diggi-loo Diggy-ley

Lightning and thunder, magic and wonder
I don't know how but it did happen to me
(You felt your heart was set free)

What a sensation (you're flying up high now)
Sweet inspiration (you're going to the sky now)
Couldn't believe I was dreaming
Couldn't believe it was true

Diggi-loo diggy-ley, life is going my way
When I'm walking in my golden shoes
Everything I ever dreamed of
Has suddenly come true

Diggi-loo diggy-ley, let this miracle stay
I could be whatever I could choose
Please don't wake me up I'm dreaming
Of me in golden shoes

Golden reflections of given directions
Bringing the best that I have right out of me
(How in the world could this be)

Filling your senses (with burning desire)
Climbing the fences (that's taking you up higher)
Now I believe I can make it
Oh what a wonderful world

Diggi-loo diggy-ley, life is going my way
When I'm walking in my golden shoes
Everything I ever dreamed of
Has suddenly come true

Diggi-loo diggy-ley, let this miracle stay
I could be whatever I could choose
Please don't wake me up I'm dreaming
Of me in golden shoes

I know my dream was a fantasy illusion
But when I woke up I came to the conclusion
I can be what I want to
Oh… oh…

Diggi-loo diggy-ley, let this miracle stay
I could be whatever I could choose
Please don't wake me up I'm dreaming
Of me in golden shoes

Please don't wake up I'm dreаming
Of me in golden shoeѕ
