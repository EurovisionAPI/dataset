Anna Maria Lena

I sing out your name, Anna
I keep you around my neck, Anna
You keep my heart warm from the cold
And you take away from me the winter and my isolation

Anna Maria Lena
One love holds us
Oh Anna, it'll only be one
Our dream in life
Anna Maria Lena

Happiness in life is dear, Anna
With a sweet purpose I'll tell it to you, Anna
Now I found the truth, an open road
Take the hand I'm giving you, we'll both reach there

Anna Maria Lena
One love holds us
Oh Anna, it'll only be one
Our dream in life
Anna Maria Lena

Oh Anna Maria Lena
One love holds us
Oh Anna, it'll only be one
Our dream in life

Oh Anna Maria Lena
One love holds uѕ
Oh Anna, it'll only be one
Our dream in life
