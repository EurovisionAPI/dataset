The trains of Tozeur

In the frontier villages they watch the trains passing
The deserted roads of Tozeur

From a distant house, your mother sees me
And she remembers me for my habits

And for a moment returns my desire
Of living at a different pace
Still the trains for Tozeur  are passing by slowly

In the abandoned churches, they prepare shelters
And new spaceships for journeys among the stars

In an old empty mine, the salt extends
And I seem to remember it, like a dream

And for a moment returns my desire
Of living at a different pace
Still the trains for Tozeur  are passing by slowly

Mmm…
Dai daba daba da…
Nanai na nana nanana nana…
Nana dabai da nana…

Still we want to show him to you 
And you will… 

In the frontier villages, they watch
The trains pаsѕing by for Tozeur
