Bye love

Do you recall the snow falling that night?
We were alone at the train station
You were holding my hand
Touching my hair and were quiet

You had to go with the first train, I know
I saw fire in your eyes
You whispered my name
You were shaking from cold and crying

Bye, love, bye, love
Bye, love, bye and write me
Go on, don't turn around
You know it's not important anymore
Your eyes are telling me everything
Just kiss me
Bye, love (Bye, love)

(Bye, love, bye, love)
