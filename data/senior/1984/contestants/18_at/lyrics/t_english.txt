Just get away

It simply was time to get away
At last out from the daily grind, from the city, by morning dawn
It was not your blame, it just was there
And I'm not worried about it, and I didn't regret, what happened

Simply gone with two suitcases into a different land
Simply gone from home, or I will lose my mind
Just get away, don't care what the others will say
Just get away, without asking you or anybody else

Devil take the hindmost, I simply have to go
I'm back to square one, I can't stand it anymore

I have already thought, it would be too late
The feeling, when everything gets on your nerves
A bit alone, but free
And you get on the train, and everything is the same for you

Simply gone with two suitcases into a different land
Simply gone from home, or I will lose my mind

Devil take the hindmost, I simply have to go
I'm back to square one, I can't stand it anymore

Simply gone with two suitcases, and then gone anywhere
Just get away, though I will soon come back to you
Simply gone with two suitcases, and then gone anywhere
Just get away, though I will ѕoon come bаck to you
