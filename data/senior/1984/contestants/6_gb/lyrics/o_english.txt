Love Games

(You were only playin' love games)
(You were only playin' love games, baby)
(You were only playin' love games)
(You were only playin' love games, baby)

Why? (Baby, baby, why?)
Why'd you wanna break my heart, babe?
You should have told me from the start, babe
(You should have told me from the start, oh baby)
You should have let me know that you were letting go

Oh why? (Baby, baby, why?)
Why'd you wanna break my heart, babe?
When you knew that we were partin', babe
(Should have told me we were partin', baby)
Should have let me know
You should have told me so

Oh darling…

You were only playin' love games
(You were only playin' love games, baby)
You were only playin' love games
(You were only playin' love games with my heart)
You gave me sugar lovin' and it stuck like glue
And all this time you had me hooked on you
(Baby, baby)

You were only playin' love games
(You were only playin' love games, baby)
You were only makin' love pains
(You were only makin' love pains with my heart)
I was just your puppet and you know it's true
You could snap your fingers and I'd run to you
(Baby, baby)

Oh why? (Baby, baby, why?)
Why'd you wanna break my heart, babe?
You should have told me at the start, babe
(You should have told me, baby, could have told me)
When you knew all the time that you were never mine

Oh why? (Baby, baby, why?)
Why'd you wanna break my heart, babe?
When you knew that we would part, babe
(When you knew that we would part, oh baby)
That you would make me cry, that you would say goodbye

Oh darling…
