100% of love

There are sighs on the telephone
Which prevent us from sleeping
On my radio there are too many songs
Which make my heart like a ragged doll

Above towns there are airplanes
And stars which turn around
Where are the horses of the merry-go-round?
Where are the gods who protect us?

Give me hundred percent of love
To share it every day
With the sky, with the people, oh…
Give me hundred percent of love

I would like to do something
With blue, with pink
To change the eyes of the earth
Which look at films in reverse

I imagine a video clip
In which children speak to birds
We have sound without pictures
We have the sea, but not the beach

Give me hundred percent of love
To share it every day
With the sky, with the people, oh…
Give me hundred percent of love

If you have in your hands
Old dreams that are useless

Give me hundred percent of love
To share it every day
With the sky, with the people, oh…
Give me hundred percent of love

Give me hundred percent of love
To share it every dаy
With the ѕky, with the people, oh…
Give me hundred percent of love
