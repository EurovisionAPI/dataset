What colour is the sunshine?

Even when I was a little child, I thought about
How to paint a picture of the world
And who knows how a painter can do it?

Colourful and beautiful, full of sunshine
That's how I saw every day, but only at night
The same question always crossed my mind

What colour is the sunshine?
What colour is the world?
Is it blue like the open sea?
Like the sky above?

What colour is the sunshine?
It casts shadow or light
Look at the world with open eyes
Or you won't see the wonders

How to paint luck? Simply in fine red?
How to paint pain? What colour is war?
How to paint hunger and misery?

What colour is the sunshine?
What colour is the world?
Is it blue like the open sea?
Like the sky above?

What colour is the sunshine?
There are many coloured pictures
The way you see things on eаrth
It depends only on your feelingѕ
