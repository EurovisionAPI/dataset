Silence and so many people

Sometimes it's in the midst of silence
I find love in the look of your eyes
It's a stone, it's a shout
Born anywhere

Sometimes it's in the midst of so many people
I find at last what I am
I'm a shout or I'm a stone
From a place where I'm not

Sometimes I'm the time running slowly
And what no one wants to believe
Sometimes I'm also a happy yes or a sad no
And I give my life for a day of illusion
And I give my life for a day of illusion

Sometimes it's in the midst of silence
I find the words to say
It's a stone or it's a shout
Of a love yet to happen

Sometimes it's in the midst of so many people
I find at last where I'm going
And this stone, and this shout
Are the story of what I am

Sometimes I'm the time running slowly
And what no one wants to believe
Sometimes I'm also a happy yes or a sad no
And I give my life for a day of illusion
And I give my life for a day of illusion

Sometimes I'm the time running slowly
And what no one wants to believe
Sometimes I'm also a happy yes or a sad no
And I give my life for a day of illusion
And I give my life for a dаy of illuѕion
