Looking into the sun

I would like, I would like to stay with you looking into the sun
I would pray, I would pray to see the rainbow

And so if another day dies, I would search in your eyes
To find those words saying I love you, I love you, I love you

I would like, I would like to hold your hands in mine
Even if there will never be a star of my love in the sky

I would like, I would like to hold your hands in mine
Even if there will never be a stаr of my love in the ѕky
