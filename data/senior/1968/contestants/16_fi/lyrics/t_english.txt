When time goes by

No more - no less, when I can see you closer
Just let me be here - because once I've stayed with you I want it like this now
But still my fear is:

When time goes by, the clock strikes too much again
Soon the night has ended, everyday work rebegins
When time goes by, soon I can see it:
I don't find you next to me
Oh, why does time run so fast?

No more - no less, when I can see you closer
Just let me be here - because once I've stayed with you I want it like this now
But still my fear is:

When time goes by, and it would bring a pale morning
The stars wouldn't shine, you fly away with them
When time goes by, I get older along with it
The time of love is left…
Oh, why can't the clocks - stop?

Just let me be here - because once I've stayed with you I want it like this now
But still my fear is:

When time goes by, the clock strikes too much again
Soon the night has ended, everyday work rebegins
When time goes by, I get older along with it
The time of love is left…
Oh, why cаn't the clocks - ѕtop?
