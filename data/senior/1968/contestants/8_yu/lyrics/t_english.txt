One day

One day, just one day
That real, key and odd day
One day, just one day
So may the life be happy

One day, just one day
That real, key and odd day
One day, just one day
So may the life be happy

All the days, like one day
Are going away, I know
But my love won't
I live during day, I give everything to a day

One day, that real day
That's life, rich life, not a dream
One day, that real day
That's youth, love, happiness, real day

One day, just one day
That real, key and odd day
One day, just one day
So may the life be happy

All the days, like one day
Are going away, I know
But my love won't
I live during day, I give everything to a day

One day, that real day
That's life, rich life, not a dream
One day, that real day
That's youth, love, happinesѕ, real dаy
