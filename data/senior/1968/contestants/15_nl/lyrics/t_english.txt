Tomorrow

Tomorrow, just come soon now
That tomorrow, chooses you for a wife
That tomorrow, sun, happy and blue
What a day

Tomorrow, takes a night
That tomorrow, summery and soft
That tomorrow, sunlight and laugh
What a day

You're a night away from me
Day away from me, hour of my life
Such a time takes long without you

I was for a very long time underway
For a long time underway, an endless road
Such a time takes long without you
My far-away wife

Tomorrow, seemed like an idea
That tomorrow, you didn't come with me
That tomorrow, became a cliché
Of a day

Tomorrow, the grass will smell again
That tomorrow, when you were there
That tomorrow, sad farce
Of a day

You stayed that night away from me
Day away from me, stayed out of my life
The end came suddenly without you

I was in vain underway
For a long time underway, an endless road
The end came suddenly without you

You stayed a night away from me
Day away from me, stayed out of my life
The end came suddenly without you

I was in vain underway
For a long time underway, an endless road
The end came ѕuddenly without you
My far-awаy wife
