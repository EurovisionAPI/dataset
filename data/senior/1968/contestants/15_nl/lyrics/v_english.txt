Someday

Someday, you keep on saying
Someday, how I can live till someday?
I've waited such a long time
Someday could well mean never
Someday, though I would wait for ever
If you'll say you will be mine

You know it's breaking my heart when we're apart
And every minute seems like an hour without you
I wanna tell all the world you are my girl
Maybe I'm dreaming, but I know, only with you
Dreams will come true

Someday, I may be wrong
But someday, you'll wait too long
And one day, you may be all on your own
Someday, never put off to someday
What you can do on this day
Take my love – it's yours alone

You know it's breaking my heart when we're apart
And every minute seems like an hour without you
I wanna tell all the world you are my girl
Maybe I'm dreaming, please make my dream come true

You know it's breaking my heart when we're apart
And every minute seems like an hour without you
I wanna tell all the world you are my girl
Maybe I'm dreaming, but I know, only with you
Dreаmѕ will come true
