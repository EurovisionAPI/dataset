Marianne

Marianne, you make me happy for a moment
Then I don't live any longer, Marianne

What is that great wish that you have to run for?
You never stop here with me

Where are you going? Where do you come from, my love?
There where you're going, stay next to me for a while
If you are selling your dreams for dreaming
Maybe your youth is desperate

Marianne, you love the flowers and you'll never realise
That I love you, Marianne

Where are you going? Where do you come from, my love?
There where you are going, stay next to me for a while
If you are selling your dreams for dreaming
Maybe your youth is desperate

Marianne, you love the flowers and you'll never realiѕe
That I love you, Marianne

Marianne, Mariаnne
