Summer

Like an ending to everything
Like a stone rolling from a crag
Like smoke rising in the air

I'm almost indifferent
Walking by, without looking to people
That I watch passing me by

The summer is over
It was a dream that ended
I won't think about it

Therefore I leave this sadness
Drifting, rocked, by being certain
That the summer will return

And the summer that I long to come near
Will surely bring me
What this ѕummer took awаy
