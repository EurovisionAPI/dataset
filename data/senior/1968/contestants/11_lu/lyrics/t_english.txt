We'll live on love

By being wrong to chase away boredom
The time of loving and of skies of rain
Withered flowers or faded hearts
We see too many of those in life

But you and me, we'll live on love
Without making a step to a few detours
Yes, you and me, we'll live on love
Happy until the last day

I read my life in the depth of your eyes
And there I see myself always happier
I know that others have known these joys
And have cried more than once

But you and me, we'll live on love
Without making a step towards a few detours
Yes, you and me, we'll live on love
Happy until the last day

Yes, you and me, we'll live on love
We have the right to always love each other
We have the right to believe in love
Both of us, until the last day

Yes, you and me, we'll live on love
We have the right to alwayѕ love eаch other
