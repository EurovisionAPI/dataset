A toast to love

A toast to love, long live love
Three cheers for love, long live love
Which keeps our world so young

It was the first time
Maybe I got it wrong then
It was the second time
That you really confused me
But the third time
I knew right away where it was headed
And then, the fourth time
I felt it for sure

A toast to love, long live love
Three cheers for love, long live love
Which keeps our world so young

A toast to love, long live love
Three cheers for love, long live love
Which keeps our world so young

That's the first time for me
And it's only because of you
That's the first time for me
That I've been able to say:

A toast to love, long live love
Three cheers for love, long live love
Which keeps our world so young

That's how it is every time with you
And it's only because of you
That for the next time with you
I can hardly wait
Because the first time
I already knew where it was headed
That there'd never be a last time for us

Lalalala lalalala…
Lalalala lalalala…
Lalalala lalalala…

Love, love, which keeps our world so young

Since the world is turning
Wherever your lucky star may be
Wherever the wind may drift you

A toast to love, long live love
Three cheers for love, long live love
Which alwаys blooms, wherever you look
Which keeps our world ѕo young
