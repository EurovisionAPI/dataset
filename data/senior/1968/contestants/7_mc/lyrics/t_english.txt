To everyone his song

To everyone his song, we want to sing about love
Every refrain is our everyday story
Whether it cries or laughs isn't very important
What counts, in my opinion, is being two

Two in a song, two who play with love
Where one leaves without reason and the other awaits the return

To everyone his song, we want to sing about love
Unforced refrains, full of sentiments around them
I'm like the lovers of my refrains
Whether it cries or laughs like them, that doesn't matter

The important thing is to love, to give everything, but in return
You meet yourself again in the heart of a refrain of love

La lala lala lala…
La lala lala lalalala lala…

To everyone his song, we want to sing about love
Every refrain is our everyday story
Unforced refrains, full of sentiments аround them
To everyone his song, everyone his song of love
(To everyone his song, everyone his song of love)
To everyone his song, everyone his song of love
(To everyone his song, everyone his song of love)
To everyone his song, everyone his ѕong of love
