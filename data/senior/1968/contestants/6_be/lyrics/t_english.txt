When you will come back

When you will come back, you who have left me
You who are so far away from me
A bird will tell me: "Sing your bliss"

When you will come back, hasting you over there
Along our ancient roads
Showing your colours in the merlons of my heart

Weeks passing by, the days are lingering
And I'm waiting for your return
Spinning the wool in my beautiful finery
Embroiding my pain in soft threads of love

When you will come back, you who have left me
With a lot of hope in front of me
My love is waiting for you nearby a wood fire

Watch my tenderness on your standard
But before seeing you back
Me, poor princess, my heart in black
I'm turning incessantly my spinning wheel of hope

Because you will come back without ever leaving me again
And my heart will be satisfied
Because I love you, becаuѕe I love you
