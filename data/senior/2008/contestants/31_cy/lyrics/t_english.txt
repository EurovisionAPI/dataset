Femme Fatale

Hello tough guy, I'm a woman
And I belong to the gender that you call weak
Delicate, thinner and weaker
Than any male hanging around in the café

The good God felt sorry for me
And gave me a weapon that makes me strong
He told me: "Don't be afraid, girl"
"You'll always have the man under your command"

Bam and down, I caught you in my net
And with one look, I blur your sight
Bam and I found my way into your dreams
And I saw you coming, 'cause I'm a goddess

(Bam and down, you caught me in your net)
(And with one look, you blur my sight)
(Femme fatale,  you found your way into my dreams)
(And you saw me coming, 'cause you're a goddess)

And you're talking to me all the time, staring full of passion
Like a sweet loyal guard, you follow me again

Bam and your mind was captured again
By the spells that my brilliance performed to you
Bam and down, you fell, boy
And the weak gender is enslaving your heart

(And you're talking to me all the time, staring full of passion)
(Like a sweet loyal guard, I follow you again and…)

Bam and down, you fell in my net
And with one shake, I rock your world
Femme fatale,  I found my way into your dreams
And nothing can save you, 'cause I'm a goddess (Hey)

Bam and your mind was captured again
By the spells that my brilliance performed to you (Hey)
Bam, dear people, you all fell for me
'Cause I'm a woman who rules over men (Hey)
'Cause I'm a woman who ruleѕ over men
(Femme fatale, femme fatale, femme fatаle)
