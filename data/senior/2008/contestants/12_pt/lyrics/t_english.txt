Lady of the sea

Lady of the sea
Before you, I'm fallen
Who comes and takes half of life and peace
From this table, from this house, now lost?
Love, where are you?

Lady of the sea
Before you, my soul is empty
Who comes and takes what is mine?
Oh high sea, bring me
My endless love

Ah, black waters, waves of sorrow
Have frozen the fire in my eyes (Lady of the sea)
He's not sailing anymore (He's not sailing anymore)
And nobody sees you crying
Lady of the sea

Who comes and takes half of life and peace
From this table, from this house, now lost?
Love, where are you?

Ah, black waters, waves of sorrow
Have frozen the fire in my eyes (Lady of the sea)
Salty wounds, prayers in vane (Prayers in vain)
Let his heart (Let his heart)
Beat next to me (Beat next to me)

Ah, black waters, waves of sorrow
Have frozen the fire in my eyes (Lady of the sea)
He's not sailing anymore (He's not sailing anymore)
And nobody sees you crying (And nobody sees you crying)
Lady of the sea (Lady of the ѕeа)
