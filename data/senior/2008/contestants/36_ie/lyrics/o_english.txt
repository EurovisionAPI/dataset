Irelande douze pointe

Oh, I come from a nation
What knows how to write a song
Oh Europe, where oh where did it all go wrong?
Come on

Irlande douze points

Drag acts and bad acts and Terry Wogan's wig
Mad acts and sad acts, it was Johnny Logan's gig

Shake your feathers and bop your beak
Shake 'em to the west and to the east
Wave Euro hands and Euro feet
Wave 'em in the air to the turkey beat

Irlande douze points
Irlande douze points
Irlande douze points
To the funky beat
Come on

G-O-B gobble B-L-E, yeah…

Hello ABBA, hello Bono, hello Helsinki
Hola Prague, hello sailor, c'est la vie
Auf Wiedersehen, Mamma Mia and God Save the Queen
G'day Austria, Bonjour Serbia
You know what I mean

Shake your feathers and bop your beak
Shake 'em to the west and to the east
Wave Euro hands and Euro feet
Wave 'em in the air to the funky beat

Shake your feathers and bop your beak
Shake 'em to the west and to the east
Wave Euro hands and Euro feet
Wave 'em in the air to the turkey beat

Irlande douze points
Irlande douze points
Irlande douze points
Aha

Irlande douze points
Irlande douze points
Irlande douze points
To the funky beat
Come on

Give us another chance, we're sorry for Riverdance
Sure Flatley, he's a Yank
And the Danube flows through France
Block vote, shock vote
Give us your twelve today
You're all invited to Dublin, Ireland
And we'll party the Shamrock way

Irlande douze points – Irlande douze points
Irlande douze points – Irlande douze points
Irlande douze points – Irlande douze points
Irlande douze points – to the funky beat
Come on

Irlande douze points, Irlande douze points

Eastern Europe, we love you
Do you like Irish stew?
Or goulash, as it is to you
(Irlande douze points, Irlande douze points)

Yes, it's Bulgaria, we love you
Belarus, Georgia, Montenegro
Moldovia, Albania, Croatia
Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Macedonia
Don't forget Turkey
Hungary, Estonia, Slovakia
Armenia, Bosnia-Herzegovа
And don't forget the Swiss – cheeѕe
