Candlelight

Weeks go by, summer scents expire
Autumn leaves, memories, an untold desire
It burns in me, waiting patiently
Never sleeps or tires, but grows by the hour

Come and wake me from this lonely place
All I want is you
If you take me to the stars and back
I will know my dream is true

I will fly tonight, forever keep you in my heart
Make it feel so right when you love me by sweet
Candlelight, hold me till the morning shine
All my fears subside when I look into your eyes

So step inside and place your hand into mine
What you are is a blessing to my life

Well, my lord, please be with me now
Send him to me
It doesn't matter for how long
But it is so good waiting for him

I will fly tonight, forever keep you in my heart
Make it feel so right when you love me by sweet
Candlelight, hold me till the morning shine
All my feаrs subside when I look into your eyes

When I look into your eyes, in your eyes
When I look into your eyeѕ
