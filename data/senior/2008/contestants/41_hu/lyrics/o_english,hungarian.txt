Candlelight

Weeks go by, summer scents expire
Autumn leaves, memories, an untold desire
It burns in me, waiting patiently
Never sleeps or tires, but grows by the hour

Come and wake me from this lonely place
All I want is you
If you take me to the stars and back
I will know my dream is true

I will fly tonight, forever keep you in my heart
Make it feel so right when you love me by sweet
Candlelight, hold me till the morning shine
All my fears subside when I look into your eyes

So step inside and place your hand into mine
What you are is a blessing to my life

Hát istenem, most légy velem
Küldd el hozzám őt
Nem számít mennyi még
Olyan jó rá várni

I will fly tonight, forever keep you in my heart
Make it feel so right when you love me by sweet
Candlelight, hold me till the morning shine
All my feаrs subside when I look into your eyes

When I look into your eyes, in your eyes
When I look into your eyeѕ
