This is my life

I spent my days in vain just waiting
For happiness to come my way
I took for granted all they gave me
I opened my eyes, finally I realised

This is my life
I don't wanna change a thing
This is my life
All the pain, all the joy it brings

All through the years
Of blood, sweat and tears
Hopes and my fears
All that was meant to be
This is my life
What will be, will be

There's no denying all the heartaches
Mmm… were just a blessing in disguise
Oh, if I never made a single mistake
Oh, I wouldn't be here, part of the plan I believe

This is my life
I don't wanna change a thing
This is my life
All the pain, all the joy it brings

All through the years
Of blood, sweat and tears
Hopes and my fears
All that was meant to be
This is my life
What will be, will be

I've found the key to set myself free
You'll be amazed
'Cause I have the power to change my ways
This is my life

This is my life
I don't wanna change a thing
This is my life
All the pain, all the joy it brings

All through the years
Of blood, sweat and tears
Hopes and my fears
All that was meant to be
This is my life
Whаt will be

This iѕ my life
