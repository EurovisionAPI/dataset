For Life

I had no choice, perfectly clear from the start
I heard your voice and I was falling
Into a space where daylight kisses moonlit skies
It was the place as written in your eyes
And oh… we made it, we finally found our way
And celebrating just where we, we stand today

I'll let my heart show the way
Oceans and mountains between us
Because your love is why
You made the wrong right
I will give my all
I will heed your call for life

I had no choice, perfectly clear from the start
I will rejoice, embrace your calling
And into a space where daylight breathes within your heart
You found my heart and I knew it was for life
Oh…

I'll let my heart show the way
Oceans and mountains between us
Because your love iѕ why
You made the wrong right
I will give my all for life
Ooh yeаh… for life
