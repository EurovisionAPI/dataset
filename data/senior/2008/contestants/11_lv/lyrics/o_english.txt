Wolves Of The Sea

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

Don't try to run, it's all set and done
There's a treasure in sight
We are robbing you blind
I hope you don't mind
We are taking it all tonight

Just walk away, we will conquer it all
Pirates will stand and the loser will fall

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing:
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

Down to the core, we're coming for more
With a sword close at hand
We are scary and bold, a chest full of gold
We get sealegs when sighting land

The hook of our captain is looking at you
There's no Peter Pan, so what can you do?

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing:
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

If you cry out to storm
We pirates will stand tall
A skull and crossbone flag is closing in
To see you fall

(Hum, hi ho, hi hum, hi hey)
(Hum, hi ho, hi hey)
(Hum, hi ho, hi hum, hi hey)

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing:
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea
We are wolves of the ѕeа
