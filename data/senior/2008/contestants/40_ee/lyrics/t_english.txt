Summer light

Who am I? Bill please
I ran out of gas
Out of gas

Two double drum cake
Bean pods, that's enough
That's enough

Summer light, it's summer light
Summer light, it's summer light
Summer light, it's summer light
Summer light, it's summer light

Potatoes, beans, onions
Lobster, that's enough

Summer light, it's summer light
Summer light, it's summer light
Summer light, it's summer light
Summer light, it's summer light

Potatoes, beans, onions
Lobster, that's enough
Sardine, that's enough

What now? Summer lights now
What now? Summer lights now
What now? Summer lights now
Whаt now? Summer lights now

Summer light, it's summer light
Summer light, it's summer light
Summer light, it's summer light
Summer light, it's ѕummer light
