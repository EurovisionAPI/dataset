To hell with it

On the floor by myself, the last tear for you in my eyes
I whipe the traces that were left behind by defeat
You without words, in a moment you destroyed my world
Now I'm gathering all the shadows of love to throw them in your face

To hell with everything that's between us
I'm throwing your pictures on the floor
To hell with it, I'm moving on on my own
Tearing all the memories so it'll be over soon

I'm not letting you look me in my eyes ever again
Now there's nothing in me for you
You're a stranger to me, whom I don't recognise on the street
When I see you, I pass you, turning my head the other way

To hell with everything that's between us
I'm throwing your pictures on the floor
To hell with it, I'm moving on on my own
Tearing all the memories so it'll be over soon

To hell with everything that's between us
I know tears for you are a waste
Now there's only drama between us
Which won't return my stolen dreams
(My stolen dreams) Dreams

You broke me, I admit
But I'm moving on
By myself into every new day
I'm stronger than ever before

To hell with everything that's between us
I'm throwing your pictures on the floor
To hell with it, I'm moving on on my own
Tearing all the memories so it'll be over soon

To hell with everything that's between us
I know tears for you are a waste
Now there's only drama between us
Which won't return my stolen dreаmѕ
