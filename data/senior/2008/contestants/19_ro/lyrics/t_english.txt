On an edge of the world

Come to an edge of the world
Like sitting on an empty bench
The sky would reach under my soles
And we won't even know if we're dreaming

Today, more than ever
My mind is calling you

A whole night long and a day
With you near me, if I stay
I'd think the world is mine
And I'll only give the world to you

Come (come) and give me your hand
I come from afar, from afar, to you (to you)
Oh, look (look) at the world I dreamt of (I dreamt of)
The present and the past with you

Today, more than ever
My mind is calling you

A whole night long and a day – I offer you my heart, you know
With you near me, if I stay – I'm in love more than ever
I'd think the world is mine  – I want you so much
And I'll only give the world to you

My whole life with you
The most beautiful dream I know – I'm in love more than ever
Our path will see – I want you so much
The light of a timeless love
The light of a timeless love
Timelesѕ

Tell me thаt you'll only be mine
