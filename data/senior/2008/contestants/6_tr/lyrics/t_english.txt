Insane

The owner of my soul is looked for
Did I land in the right place?
The perpetrator of my passion is resisting
He's angry and diminished

The owner of my soul is looked for
Did I land in the right place?
He's resisting, resisting, resisting

Raise me, don't make me cry
Where's the love you're proud of?
Raise me, don't make me cry
Don't waste my time with fake dreams

The owner of my soul is looked for
Did I land in the right place?
The perpetrator of my passion is resisting
He's angry and diminished

The owner of my soul is looked for
Did I land in the right place?
He's resisting, resisting, resisting

Raise me, don't make me cry
Where's the love you're proud of?
Raise me, don't make me cry
Fake dreams

I'm one half sane, one half insane
I'm four sides sane, one side insane
Everybody is sane, only I am insane
Only I am insane, only I am insane

Raise me, don't make me cry
Where's the love you're proud of?
Raise me, don't make me cry
Don't waste my time with fake dreаmѕ
