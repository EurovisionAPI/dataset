Hero

Everything has a beginning
Everything comes to an end
Take it or leave it, you'd better believe it
Be my love or be my friend

Try to deny what you're feeling
And you'll know that your heart will say no
Love will last longer, growing stronger and stronger
If you stay and don't let go

Oh… out of the light, like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh… taking the fight is the life of a hero
Staying alive

This is a story of love and compassion
Only heroes can tell
Oh… out of the light, like a star, like a hero
Love will survive

Heaven and earth keep colliding
But with love on a world of its own
Oh… there you can't fake it, just make it or break it
Only you can find the one

Oh… out of the light, like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh… taking the fight is the life of a hero
Staying alive

This is a story of love and compassion
Only heroes can tell
Oh… out of the light, like a star, like a hero
Love will survive (Will survive)
Oh… survive (Will survive)

Heroes can live on their own
But heroes never die alone

Oh… out of the light, like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh… taking the fight is the life of a hero
Staying alive
(This is a story of love and compassion)
Heroes can tell
Oh, out of the light, like a star, like а hero
Love will ѕurvive
