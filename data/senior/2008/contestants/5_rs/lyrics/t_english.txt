Oro

Who caresses my loved one?
Who kisses those sleepy lips?
Don't forget my name
When she begins to kiss you
My dear cornstalks, don't sleep
Kiss him, and put me asleep

Don't break my ice, there's no water within
Don't put salt on my wound, I have no more tears
Whoever dances my Oro
He shouldn't dance it for the two of us
Cornstalks, put me to sleep

Nuna ney, nuna nuna nuna nuna nuna ney
Nuna ney, nuna nuna nuna nuna nuna ney
Wake me on Saint Vitus' day, to look at him again

Nuna ney, nuna nuna nuna nuna nuna ney
Nuna ney, nuna nuna nuna nuna nuna ney
Wake me on Saint Vitus' day, to look at him again
Wake me on Saint Vituѕ' day, to look аt him once more
