Your Heart Belongs To Me

I remember the time when I was in love with a fool
He stepped on my heart, bruised me, broke the golden rule
There was a time when I couldn't tell weak from strong
A voice in my head kept saying: this can't go on
Even though I longed, something's wrong

You know your heart belongs to me
You made it clear to see
That we were never meant to be
Only a memory remains

Oh yes, your heart belongs to me
But I've got to set you free
'Cause we were never meant to be
Together

I've learned my lesson, now I know where I stand
Time heals all wounds, and broken hearts will mend
I've read all the signs, now I've moved along
This carousel keeps turning on and on
And on and on, life goes on

You know your heart belongs to me
You made it clear to see
That we were never meant to be
Only a memory remains

Oh yes, your heart belongs to me
But I've got to set you free
'Cause we were never meant to be
Together

I wish I was the wind, the sun, the rain
And I could hold time in my hands
In my dreams I'll fly high so I can reach the stars
I sit on top of a mountain
And scream when nobody hears me
Nobody sees me, ho…

You know your heart belongs to me
You made it clear to see
That we were never meant to be
Only a memory remains

Oh yes, your heart belongs to me
But I've got to set you free
'Cause we were never meant to be
Together

You know your heаrt belongѕ to me
