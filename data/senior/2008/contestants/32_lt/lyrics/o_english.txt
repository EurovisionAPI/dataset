Nomads In The Night

Through passing days, I close my eyes and feel silk burning me
Your skin, those gorgeous lips I've kissed so long ago
Tonight I'll try to rip out this aching heart, it's filled with you
It's filled with lonely pain – obey

Moon, I follow you in darkness
It seems we're nomads in the night
Your cold turns me into the heartless
Until the sunrise burning light brings down her sky blue shining eyes

This hollow day, like days before I walk through thousand smiles
And try to find the look that heals all wounds inside
But still I'm here at the world's edge falling like stone to you
Shining so high, alone – like me

Moon, I follow you in darkness
It seems we're nomads in the night
Your cold turns me into the heartless
Until the sunrise burning light

Seems we're nomads in the night
Your cold turns me into the heаrtless
Until the sunrise burning light brings down her sky blue shining eyeѕ
