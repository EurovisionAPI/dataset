Peace Will Come

Look, the sky is crying cold bitter tears
Weeping for the people lost in fear
While we fight for nothing, my eyes run dry
Are you still so blind to ask me why?
Why?

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, shout: peace will come
When you stop and tame your rage
Something's gotta change
Something's gotta change

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, shout: peace will come
Blow the trumpet, beat the drum
Peace will come

Sometimes words kill faster than bullets do
But the face of war is never true
Kids with guns are always too young to die
Are you still so deaf to ask me why?
Why?

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, shout: peace will come
When you stop and tame your rage
Something's gotta change
Something's gotta change

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, shout: peace will come
Blow the trumpet, beat the drum
Peace will come

My land is still crying, torn in half
My world is slowly dying
My heart is only crying
Peace and love
Oh no, no, no

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, shout: peace will come
When you stop and tame your rage
Something's gotta change
Something's gotta change

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, ѕhout: peace will come
Blow the trumpet, beat the drum
Peace will come

Blow the trumpet, beat the drum
Peаce will come
