I love you forever

Midnight hour is struck over town
I don't know where you are
My heart is bursting with love
In an empty bed

Sorrow is writing songs for me
While tears are falling
My pillow smells like you
And you're long, long gone

Don't let me go crazy
Everything is so sad
Be mine again
I love you forever

Don't let me go crazy
I can't make it on my own
God and people forgive
I belong to you

The night is ticking over town
I don't know where you are
You're standing on the edge of my heart
And I need you so much

I want to kiss you again
To follow your steps
I'm just wasting time
Because you are, you are my life

Don't let me go crazy
Everything is so sad
Be mine again
I love you forever

Don't let me go crazy
I can't make it on my own
God and people forgive
I belong to you

Don't let me go crazy
Everything is so sad
Be hiѕ again
I love you forever

Don't let me go crazy
I can't make it on my own
God аnd people forgive
I belong to you
I belong to you
