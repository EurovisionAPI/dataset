Casanova

(Oh Casanova… nova… nova…)

A thousand stars were shining their light in the night skies
You and me, a magical moment in your eyes (Casanova)
Lost in love, I'd waited a lifetime to find you
The stars above were burning so bright to remind you (Casanova)
Boom, boom, boom, my heart still goes crazy
When I think of you

Oh Casanova
I thought love would last forever
That we'd always stay together
Can't you feel it in your heart?

Oh Casanova
In a fairy tale I found you
I'm alive when I'm around you
I can't live if we're apart

A simple song can bring back the past to remind me
Now you're gone and all the good times behind me (Casanova)
Boom, boom, boom, my heart still goes crazy
When I think of you

Oh Casanova
I thought love would last forever
That we'd always stay together
Can't you feel it in your heart?

Oh Casanova
In a fairy tale I found you
I'm alive when I'm around you
I can't live if we're apart

Vull escoltar que tu m'estimes
I want to dream this dream with you

Oh Casanova
I thought love would last forever
That we'd always stay together
Can't you feel it in your heart?

Oh Casanova
In a fairy tale I found you
I'm alive when I'm around you
I can't live if we're apart

Oh Caѕanovа
