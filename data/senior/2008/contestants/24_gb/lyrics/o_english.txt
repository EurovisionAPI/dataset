Even If

You're keeping me fascinated
No, I ain't running all over town
I feel so intoxicated
I'm struggling to keep my feet on the ground

I'm not playing, girl
This ain't no game at all
And for the first time
I'm not looking for love

So come here, baby, listen to me
I just want ya to believe me

Even if the world stops lovin'
I could never stop lovin' you
Even if the sun stops risin'
I still wanna wake up with you
Yeah…

Even if my heart was breakin'
I could never break your heart too
Even if all words lost their meaning
You would understand I love you
Yes, I do

Your sensuality thrills me
It strips me to my soul
As your reality cures me
Your lovin' takes a hold
I'm barely in control

I'm not pretending, girl
That ain't what's goin' on
There's no room for lies
Ain't no room at all

So come here, baby, listen to me
I just want ya to believe me

(Even if the world stops lovin')
I could never stop lovin' you
Even if the sun stops risin'
I still wanna wake up with you

Even if my heart was breakin'
I could never break your heart too, no, no
Even if all words lost their meaning
You would understand I love you
Yes, I do

(Break it down, break it down)
(Girl, you gotta know) Yes, I do
(We got to break it down, break it down)
(It's time to feel the flow) Hey yeah…

(Break it down, break it down)
(Girl, you gotta know) Help me break it down
(We got to break it down, break it down)
(It's time to feel the flow) Ooh yeah…

(Even if the world stops lovin')
(I could never stop lovin' you) I could never stop lovin' you
(Even if the sun stops risin')
(I still wanna wake up with you) I will always wake up, baby

Even if my heart was breakin'
(I could never break your heart too) Aha, aha, aha baby, baby
Even if all words lost their meaning
You would underѕtаnd I love you
