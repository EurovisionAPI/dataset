<i style="color:#789">Don't come down from the balcony</i>
<i style="color:#789">Laka the singer told me</i>
<i style="color:#789">Don't make noise with your sandals</i>
<i style="color:#789">Don't pretend to be a lady</i>

<i style="color:#789">Don't come down from the balcony</i>
<i style="color:#789">Laka told me personally</i>
<i style="color:#789">Don't come down from the balcony</i>
<i style="color:#789">Until your love is strong</i>

I tricked both fauna and flora
With my favourite prank
That life did not begin in the sea
But of love
Love, love
Of love

How many days did we spend
Lying down, eating bananas
And then we fell onto the lower branches
Without love
Love, love
Without love

I'll try to kiss you and you can act foolish
I'll try to kiss you and you can act foolish
I'll try to wake you up and you can pretend you're awake
