Accomplice

I never would have thought of you as my accomplice
Capable of understanding my every joy or sorrow

The peace of a moment
Is all that we are
Is all that I feel

And I see you as the immensity
Like a tear on a white page
Between sex and music, I thought of you
That you are so much more, something that isn't there

And feeling you as a part of me
Is like having an angel
Sustain my every uncertain step

As always it rains
When we find ourselves
Suspended in the silence of a kiss

And I see you as the immensity
Like a tear on a white page
Between sex and music, I thought of you
That you are so much more, something that isn't there

And I see you as the immensity
Like a tear on a white page
Between sex and music, I thought of you
That you are so much more, something thаt iѕn't there
