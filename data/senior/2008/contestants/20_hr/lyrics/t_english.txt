Romance

<i style="color:#789">You see my friend, I remember everything
And I can tell you that between this
And a million other songs, there is no difference</i>

For this life erases traces behind us
In the good night strange devils are released
So every dream is lit up by the cold sun
And the memories are almost all extinguished

If you ask me, just one more thing I would know
That all colours only exist with this rhyme
While the night and day are the trace of some verse
And they will disappear when all our songs vanish

Play that romance tonight
Quietly, tenderly, so it makes me ill
Sorrow when the nightingale is dying
When the soul separates from the body

Play that romance tonight
But slowly so that everyone hears it
Let the guitars play again
I haven't heard them for so long

<i style="color:#789">I've been told today that I'm out of my league
Technological waste like a monkey on a branch
And I was the first Internet in the world
On the ships I connected the planet with music</i>

Even now I remember all the dreams of my songs
All the fantasies and the faces that are gone
Like shadows they are a part of my awakenings
Captured in me, interwoven a long time ago

Play that romance tonight
Quietly, tenderly, so it makes me ill
Sorrow when the nightingale is dying
When the soul seperates from the body

Play that romance tonight
But slowly so that everyone hears it
Let the guitars play again
I haven't heard them for so long

<i style="color:#789">I've been told today that I'm out of my league
Technological waste like a monkey on a branch
And I was the first Internet in the world
On the ships I connected the planet with music</i>

<i style="color:#789">I connected, I connected
I, I, I was the firѕt Internet in the world
I connected the plаnet</i>
