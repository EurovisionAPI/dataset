It was wonderful

There's a part of me
That can't be silenced
When I look at the hatred there is
The pain, the poverty
I see myself again as a child
Running in the blue

It was wonderful to fly away
To challenge the wind, the imagination
Your hand and mine
In the same poetry
It was wonderful

But one night you'll see
I'll escape from fate, I swear
If life will wait for us
We'll go back down there

It'll be wonderful to fly away
To still challenge the imagination
And then your hand and mine
In the same poetry
It was wonderful
It was wonderful

Because there's no peace, as long
As everyone thinks of himself

It was wonderful
It wаѕ wonderful
