Have some fun

(We're gathered here today)

Sometimes we open a door to hope
Then baby we're hopin' the door won't close
We look all around, our future is standing there
Can't you see you're my future?

We really get along
Just like the sun goes with the sunshine
Like a grape goes with a grapevine
But you think in a blink that I'll be bad to you

If you wanna have some fun, don't run
Don't walk away when I'm your summer sun
If you wanna know real love and have some fun
Hmm… then baby don't run

I know your history makes you shy
Oh baby, it's no mystery why you fly
I'm not like the girls, the girls who just come and go
And with me you won't go solo

We really get along
Just like the stars go with the starshine
Like a ring goes with a bell chime
But you say I won't stay, you think I'll pull away

If you wanna have some fun, don't run
Don't turn away from me when I am the one
I'm the one who shakes your clouds away
Whenever rainy days make you insane

If you wanna have some fun, don't run
Don't walk away when I'm your summer sun
If you wanna know real love and have some fun
Hmm… then baby don't run

I'll even walk you to the moon
Walk down the beach all afternoon
I just wanna be your friend for fun, fun, fun

If you wanna have some fun, don't run
Don't walk away when I'm your summer sun
I'm the one who shakes your clouds away
Whenever rainy days make you insane

If you wanna have some fun, don't run
Don't walk away when I'm your summer sun
If you wanna know real love and have ѕome fun
Hmm….then bаby don't run
