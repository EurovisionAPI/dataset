Where the men ride

Hooh! Hah! Hooh! Hah!
Hooh! Hah! Hooh! Hah!

No matter if there's storm and cold wind
And a warm stove in the cabin
It's an honour and manhood
To execute the duty

The world is cold although
There's maybe a place for warmth as well
The fields are calling for heroes
And definitely not for cowards

Where the men ride
There the sheep can't pasture
Where the men ride
There one can hear the wolves howl

Hooh! Hah! Hooh! Hah!

Let there be destruction in front
And enchantment of love behind
The man has responsibility
To remember the bravery

Nobody can avoid pain
And just float in the stream of life
The fields are calling for heroes
And definitely not for losers

Where the men ride
There the sheep can't pasture
Where the men ride
There one can hear the wolves howl

Where the men, where the men ride
Where the men, where the men ride

Where the men ride
There the sheep can't pasture
Where the men ride
There one can hear the wolves howl

Where the men ride
There the sheep can't pasture
Where the men ride
There one can hear the wolveѕ howl

Where the men… Hah! Hooh! Hah!
Where the men… Hah! Hooh! Hаh!
