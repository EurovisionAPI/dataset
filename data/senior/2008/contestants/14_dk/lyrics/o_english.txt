All Night Long

The sun is up
I'm feeling great
I'm just enjoying life
Right here in the shade

Let's take a ride, right away
I'll be by your side
So easy the easy life

Celebrate the good times

All night long
All night long
Celebrate good times – come on
All night long

Who's to tell
What's to come
All I know is tomorrow
Today will be gone

Get out, out of bed
Put on your blue suede shoes – aha
Get up, up and dance

Celebrate the good times

All night long
All night long
Celebrate good times – come on
All night long

If your life is like a sad song maybe
You should try and celebrate it
Celebrate it

All night long
All night long
Celebrаte good timeѕ – come on
All night long
