Vodka

(Na zdarovye!)
(Hey hey hey hey hey hey)
(Na zdarovye!)
(Hey hey hey hey hey)

The hunt is still on
Here in Gorky Park
I'm in a danger zone
Everywhere is pitch dark

I'm running away
To a blanket of snow
Spy One to Spy Four
I've deciphered the code, yeah…

Vodka – that's the secret word
Vodka – and they want it so bad
Vodka – I've deciphered the code
Got a rush in the head
Vodka – a transparent word

(Na zdarovye!)
(Hey hey hey hey hey hey)
(Na zdarovye!)
(Hey hey hey hey hey)

Cold blood drums within
They breathe down my neck
Spy One to Spy Four
We just have to connect

Their footsteps are near
Closing in for the kill
My pulse has gone dead
With a heart-racing chill, yeah…

Vodka – that's the secret word
Vodka – and they want it so bad, so bad, so bad
Vodka – I've deciphered the code
Got a rush in the head, yeah…
Vodka – a transparent word…

(Vodka – that's the secret word)
(Na zdarovye!) Yeah…
(Vodka – and they want it so bad) So bad, yeah
(Hey hey hey hey hey hey)

Vodka, yeah… (That's the secret word)
(Na zdarovye!)
Vodka – a tranѕpаrent word
(Hey hey hey hey hey hey)
