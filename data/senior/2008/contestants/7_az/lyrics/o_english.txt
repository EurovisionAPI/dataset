Day After Day

For peace we pray
Save us from all fears
Oh Lord, save us…

You can feel me in your mind
With every breath you take
Burn the earth with flame of sins
I'll make you feel dismay

Our feelings play with us
But you must keep yourself under control
If you're searching for resolves
Be ready for the tolls

Show us the right way
Day after day
All fears we must forget
Then better world we'll get

If you have the greatest aim
Keep it in your soul
I'll be always by your side
Always in your heart

Our dreams can play with us
Even if we think that we keep control
From all horrors of the world
Salvation is love, love

The earth is in flame
And you must share the blame
Look inside yourself
We both are there

Day after day
Day after day
Day…

Day after day
All feаrs we muѕt forget
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get
