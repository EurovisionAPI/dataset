Hasta la vista

You shone on me like a blinding star
I've just never seen such a light so far
All my days, like fairy tales

I begged you to look in my loving eyes
But you were as cold as arctic ice
And your laugh has killed my love

The story is close to the final cut
It won't be the end, but a running start
So don't be upset, please don't ask me why
I say goodbye

Hasta la vista, baby
I'm gonna miss you, maybe
You can be really happy
Though it's not fair

Hasta la vista, baby
I'm gonna miss you, maybe
Hasta la vista, blame me
But I don't care

No way to repair the broken glass
There's nothing to share nor to discuss
Now I see, you're not for me
(You're not for me)

You've cast me away to a desert shore
You've shattered my heart, now you keep the score
Have a rest, you've done your best

The story is close to the final cut
It won't be the end, but a running start
So don't you pretend you can't get it why
I say goodbye

Hasta la vista, baby
I'm gonna miss you, maybe
You can be really happy
Though it's not fair

Hasta la vista, baby
I'm gonna miss you, maybe
Hasta la vista, blame me
But I don't care

Hasta la vista
Hasta la viѕtа
