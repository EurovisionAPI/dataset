Let Me Love You

Let's go

Let's go, let's go, let's go
What ya gonna do if I let you know
You're the only one I've been dreaming for
I've never felt love like this before

Let's go, let's go, let's go
Where the moon is full and the lights are low
We can do it so slow, kiss in slo-mo
Until dawn breaks, then I ride out solo

You always knew how to make me cry
I feel so helpless without you
I'm starting to lose my mind
I wanna be with you tonight

The stars above glow like they're making love
I'm running under the moonlight
Alone in the sleepless night
Just to be right by your side

Let me love you, just let me love you
Unfold your angel wings
Fly out from my wildest dreams
Let me love you, just let me love you
Kiss me and let me die
Before you tell me goodbye

Let's go, let's go, let's go
What ya gonna do if I let you know
You're the only one I've been dreaming for
I've never felt love like this before

Let's go, let's go, let's go
Where the moon is full and the lights are low
We can do it so slow, kiss in slo-mo
Until dawn breaks, then I ride out solo

You always knew how to make me cry
Who needs a smile when my tears
Are so full of love inside
And they are stronger than my pride

Let me love you, just let me love you
Unfold your angel wings
Fly out for my wildest dreams
Let me love you, just let me love you
Kiss me and let me die
Before you tell me goodbye

Let me love you, just let me love you
Kisѕ me аnd let me die
Before you tell me goodbye
