The Fire In Your Eyes

My soul is longing for the warm heart's prayer

It is hard, it is hard
When a longing by moonlight
Is here for a moment and then flees
The tears go after it

It is hard, it is hard
When a longing by moonlight
Is here for a moment and then flees
The tears go after it

Sometimes the wind brings a good, familiar scent
It caresses, listens to you sing now

Not starlight
You are now
With me, with me, as if real
Like back then long ago

Come along, come along
See the fire in your eyes
And you come with me
With me

Sometimes the wind brings a good, familiar scent
It caresses, listens now

Not starlight
You are now
With me, with me, as if real
Like back then long ago

My soul is longing for the warm heart's prayer
My soul is longing for the warm heart's prayer

Not starlight
With me, with me, aѕ if real
Like back then long аgo
