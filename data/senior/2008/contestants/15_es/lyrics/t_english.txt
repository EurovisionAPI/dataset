Dance the Chiki Chiki

Twerk, twerk

Twerk, twerk

The Chiki Chiki is really cool
They dance it in China and also in Alcorcón
Give the Chiki Chiki to that tan girl
Because the Chiki Chiki drives her crazy

José Luis dances it, he dances it very smoothly
Mariano dances it, my love, you know it
The brothers dance it, my brother dances it
My mulatta dances it with panties in her hand

Twerk, twerk

The Chiki Chiki is a Reggaeton
Dance in Argentina, Serbia and Oregon
Give the Chiki Chiki to that little sister
With the Chiki Chiki she's gonna like it, mister

Dance it with Alonso, dance it with Gasol
Dance it with your brothers, all around the world
Dance it with Bardem, dance it with Banderas
Dance with Almodóvar, dance the Macarena

And the Chiki Chiki is danced like this:
One: the breakdance
Two: the crossed legs
Three: the Michael Jackson
Four: the Robocop

Dance the Chiki Chiki, dance the Chiki Chiki
Heavy metal guys dance it and so do freaks
They dance it in prison, they dance it at school
My mother dances it and so does my grandmother

Dance the Chiki Chiki, dance the Chiki Chiki
Heavy metal guys dance it and so do freaks
They dance it in prison, they dance it at school
My mother dances it and so does my grandmother

El Puma sings it with his striped costume
And Juan Carlos says: "Why don't you shut up?"
At Father Damien's wake
They played the Chiki Chiki and the dead man started to dance

Dance, dance, dance

And the Chiki Chiki is danced this way:
One: the breakdance
Two: the crossed legs
Three: the Michael Jackson
Four: the Robocop

Twerk, twerk

José Luis dances it, he dances it very smoothly
Mariano dances it, my love, you know it
The brothers dance it, my brother dances it
My mulatta dances it with panties in her hand

And the Chiki Chiki is danced this way:
One: the breakdance
Two: the crossed legs
Three: the Michael Jackson
Four: the Robocop

One: the breakdance
Two: the crossed legs
Three: the Michael Jаckѕon
Four: the Robocop
