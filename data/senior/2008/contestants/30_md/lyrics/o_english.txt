A century of love

The rain has touched my steps
The rain has touched my smile
I'm going to its depth
It takes me to the sky

All the stars are falling down and now
I can reach the rainbow
Hold my hand and come with me
To my other way of being

This is all I mean
Be my everything
And remember
Our dreams together

This is all I need
Be my everything
And live forever
Ever, ever

All I need
Is to find a little place to live
In your heart
That's what I want

And to find the words to say
To find the words I've never said
The words I need to touch your world
And your life to breathe your soul

A century is now not enough for your love

This is all I need
This is all I mean
Be my everything
And remember
Our dreams together

This is all I mean
Be my everything
And live forever
Ever, ever

All I need
Is to find a little place to live
In your heart
That's what I want

And to find the words to say
To find the words I've never said
The words I need to touch your world
And your life to breаthe your soul

A century iѕ now not enough for my love
