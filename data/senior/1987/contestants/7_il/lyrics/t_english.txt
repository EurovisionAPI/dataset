The bums' song

Come on already, please

Each morning I wake up at around ten
I want to see the sun, the shutters are blocking the view
I open the shutters and I can't see the sun
Because the sun is blocked by rows of buildings

I make myself a cup of coffee and light a cigarette
I go out to the balcony to crack open some seeds
The birds come down to the plants of the balcony
And sing with me the bums' song

Hupa hule hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa…
Hupa hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa…

At around noon I send the dog
With a basket made of straw to buy me some groceries
When he comes back, I make us both lunch
Because the birds have eaten all the seeds

Suddenly I hear a ring, someone's knocking at the door
I open the door, the neighbour comes in
She asks politely, if it's no bother
To sing with me my hupa'le

Hupa hule hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa…
Hupa hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa…

In the afternoon I go out with the dog
To get some air in the park on the city outskirts
The birds fly happily towards the sky
I lay back on the bench, thinking about life

I'm living in such a wonderful reality
I'm swimming in a whirlpool of a sea with no worries
I don't understand how anyone can live differently nowadays
And I fall asleep, tired of all the thoughts

Hupa…
Hupa hole… hole hupa…
Hupa hole… hole hupa… hole hupa…

The moon is already rising, the night is coming
I want to see the moon, the shutters are blocking the view
I open the shutters and I can't see the moon
Because the moon is blocked by rows of buildingѕ

Hupa hule hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa…
Hupa hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa…

Hupa hule hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa…
Hupa hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa…

Hupa hule… hule hupa… doing nothing
Hole hupа…
