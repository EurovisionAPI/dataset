My life

Now the limelight has been lit, a voice whispers anxiously
What have I to say?
Will I dare to walk forward? Do I dare to meet them?
Do I have enough to give?
I have to seize the chance now
But can I trust myself, my life?

Now I'm standing in front of a road, only I can walk
A future in my hands
And a goal only I can catch
No one can take my dream away from me, it is my life

I'm looking for answers
All the thoughts I have, make me doubt
But that won't stop me
I want to go my own way and I dare to say
Now it's me it's all about
Now I'm going to trust myself, my life

Now I'm standing in front of a road, only I can walk
A future in my hands
And a goal only I can catch
No one can take my dream away from me

In front of a road, only I can walk
A future in my handѕ
And a goal only I can reach
No one can take away from me
No one can take away my dream from me
My dreаm
