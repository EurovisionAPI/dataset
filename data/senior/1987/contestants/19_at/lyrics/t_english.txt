Only feelings

Hold me tight, when you lose courage
I want to be tender, so you don't have to freeze
You're like a child, that I want to protect
At the beginning, we only have feelings

Also, you've often touched the fire
You've burned yourself on it, you only got lost in it

Our fire burns, slowly and quietly
Because for us, only feelings exist

And we'll never feel this emptiness again
Only feelings, and nothing more
This love for a time, in loneliness
Are only feelings

Come closer to me, because I want to feel you
And I only give you feelings

As much as you want, only feelings
As much as I hаve, only feelings
Only feelingѕ
