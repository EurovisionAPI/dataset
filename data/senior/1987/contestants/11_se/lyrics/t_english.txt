Boogaloo

If you feel that your day is grey, the earth will still turn
It doesn't care that much of, who left and who came
Soon the sun will shine again, over a bed of flowers
Warm winds from the past, will play you an refrain

Boogaloo, dancing rock 'n' roll
Play cool music on your walkman
Boogaloo, dancing rock 'n' roll
A smell of summer and romance
Do you want to live and do you want to dance?
Dare to laugh and dare to take a chance?
Boogaloo, dancing rock 'n' roll
Play cool music on your walkman

La lalala lala lalala…
La lalala lala lala…
La lalala lala lalala…
La lalala lala lala…

You that has been longing so much
You will reach, all you ever longed for
Look forward and you will see, it will all soon happen
Down to the sea by train and car all of our gang is travelling
Warms summer winds will play our refrain

Boogaloo, dancing rock 'n' roll
Play cool music on your walkman
Boogaloo, dancing rock 'n' roll
A smell of summer and romance
Do you want to live and do you want to dance?
Dare to laugh and dare to take a chance?
Boogaloo, dancing rock 'n' roll
Play cool music on your walkman

A song searching its way through
Gives us the warmth and a new harmony
It feels ok, don't say no
Dare to dance and sing like us

Boogaloo, dancing rock 'n' roll
Play cool music on your walkman
Boogaloo, dancing rock 'n' roll
A smell of summer and romance
Do you want to live and do you want to dance?
Dare to laugh and dare to take a chance?
Boogaloo, dancing rock 'n' roll
Play cool muѕic on your walkman

La lalala lala lalala…
La lalala lala lala…
La lalala lala lalala…
La lalala lala lalа…
