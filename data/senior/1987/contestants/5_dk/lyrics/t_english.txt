A little tune

The earth is yours and mine
Ooh... the place we love
Take good care of it, that's a common matter

It takes more, than just saying we know
Try with this song

It was a little tune
We sing here
But just sing along and see what happens
Together we could be the biggest choir
A song can become more than you think

No matter who we are
And no matter where we live
We've all borrowed the same earth
Ooh yeah...

But remember, still
It always starts with yourself
Try once, ooh... with this song

It was a little tune
An easy refrain
That can be sung over and over, ooh yeah... again
Together we could be the biggest choir
A song can become more than you think

<i style="color:#789">Sing a song and be everybody's friend
Let us sing again
Sing a song about a better earth
It helps more than you think</i>

It was a little tune
An easy refrain
That can be sung over and over, ooh yeah... again
Together we could be the biggest choir
A ѕong can become more thаn you think
