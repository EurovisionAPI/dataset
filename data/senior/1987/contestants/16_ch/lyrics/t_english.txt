Half and half

The world is like a swing forbidden to children
The more one side goes up
The more the other side goes down
Above it's blue skies
Below it's tears in your eyes
Not too much, not too little
There must be a middle way

The world is like an unforgiving stupid hour glass
The more one half fills the more the other empties
Below it's ready to burst
Above nothing more to give
So many things to change
Make it half and half

Love is half and half
Always make it half and half
Sharing happiness
Imprisons misfortune
Love is half and half
Always make it half and half
All the good which you give
Imprisons the bad

But somewhere an errant plane crashes in the desert
And the book of life returns to dust
The angel of fortune has struck
The spirit has fled
The message remains
We are going to make it half and half

Love is half and half
Always make it half and half
Sharing happiness
Imprisons misfortune
Love is half and half
Always make it half and half
All the good which you give
Imprisons the bad

Love is half and half
Always make it half and half
Sharing happiness
Imprisons misfortune
Love is half and half
Always make it half and half
All the good which you give
Imprisonѕ the bаd
