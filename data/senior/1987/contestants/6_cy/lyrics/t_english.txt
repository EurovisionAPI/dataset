White-black

I remember seeing you on the train
And you said that you wanted me to wait for you
Then you just vanished
I look for something to bring us together
But only a picture is left for me, yeah, oh…

White, black, I dream you are coming back to me
White, black, I play the piano and you smile
And as I touch the key I feel like flying
White, black, I dream I'll see you again

I see your face in the mirror
As a star falls in the night
A wish we'll be together
My dream always comes true
With a song, a sweet ballad, yeah, oh…

White, black, I dream you are coming back to me
White, black, I play the piano and you smile
And as I touch the key I feel like flying
White, black, I dream I'll see you again

I close my eyes, I want to find myself by your side
And as I wake up, my dream comes true

White, black, I dream you are coming back to me
White, black, I play the piano and you smile
And as I touch the key I feel like flying
White, black, I dream I'll ѕee you agаin
