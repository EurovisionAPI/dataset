Love love

Love, love
How good it is when you overpower us
Love, love
You're the strongest, the cleverest

A small red dot on the horizon
I climb all the way up the dungeon again
As long as I'm getting somewhere
What a release – 'lease

Go on, it's the right direction
It's time to pump up the balloons again
I'm full of good vibrations, yeah
Good vibrations – 'brations

Love, love
How good it is when you overpower us
Love, love
You're the strongest, the cleverest

My radar is in panic
Fatal beauty, admit it's weird
It's not my day, Friday the thirteenth – thirteenth
Softly I come closer, unexpectedly
Sure of my ground, definitely no come-on
I feel uncomfortable, she's only sixteen – sixteen

Love, love
How good it is when you overpower us
Love, love
You're the strongest, the cleverest

Love, love, when you overpower us
You're the cowboy, we're the Indians
How rough you are
How nasty you are when you overpower us

If she clears off, I step aside
I pick up all her little pebbles
And I hang on
Thаt's rotten – rotten

Love, love
How good it is when you overpower us
Love, love
You're the strongest, the cleverest

Love, love
How good it is when you overpower us
Love, love
You're the strongest, the cleverest

Love, love
How good it is when you overpower uѕ
