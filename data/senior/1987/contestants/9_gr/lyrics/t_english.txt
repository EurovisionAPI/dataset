Stop!

Just like a star, posing when the lights flash
Your style is like Garbo, glitter on your jacket
Whatever you do is for fame and money
See what you are missing, joy is somewhere else

And I tell you stop! Don't! Life is rock 'n' roll
Stop! Don't! Just think for a second
Stop! Don't! Let's start all over again
Look… it's not too late

You go around in discos, talking about cinema
A life full of risk, champagne, parties, secrets
Whatever you do is for fame and money
See what you are missing, joy is somewhere else

And I tell you stop! Don't! Life is rock 'n' roll
Stop! Don't! Just think for a second
Stop! Don't! Let's start all over again
Look… it's not too late

And I tell you stop! Don't! Life is rock 'n' roll
Stop! Don't! Just think for a second
Stop! Don't! Let's start all over again
Look… it'ѕ not too lаte

Stop
