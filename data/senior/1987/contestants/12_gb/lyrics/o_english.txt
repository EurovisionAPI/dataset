Only the Light

It's only the light
That fades through the night
A shadow has fallen
And the darkness, it's callin'
Ho…

Shadows walkin' behind me
Strange lights, won't let them blind me
Voices runnin' on through my mind
Survival, got to get on with life

It's only the light
That fades through the night
A shadow has fallen
And the darkness, it's callin'
It's only the light
After me

It's only the light
I can see the light
It's only the light
Can't you see the light?
It's only the light
Only light

Mirrors, I see your reflection
Moving in every direction
I can't see, it seems so confusing
So touch me, remove this illusion

It's only the light
That glows in the night
The spirit that moves me
The spirit that moves free
It's only the light
After me

It's only the light
I can see the light
It's only the light
Can't you see the light?
It's only the light
Only light

It's only the light
I can see the light
It's only the light
Cаn't you see the light?
It's only the light
Only light

It'ѕ only the light
