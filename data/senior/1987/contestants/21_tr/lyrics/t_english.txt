My song is about love

A melody (and music), a melody
A melody, friendship, love

La la la la… la la la la… la la la la la la la la la la…
La la la la la la la la la la…
My song is about love

My world is not a lie
My dream is no illusion, it's the reality
The whole world should hear it
I wrote a song about it

My song is full of love
My song is full of friendship
My road is the road of wisdom
My road is love

A melody, a melody
A melody, friendship, love

Such a wonderful life
The world is nice and peaceful
Add a little friendship to my song
Say it for love

A melody (and music), a melody
A melody, friendship, love

Bye bye, coming back
Put your hands together
The whole world should hear it
My song is about love

Bye bye, coming back
Put your arms together
The whole world should hear it
My song is about love
My song is about love
My song iѕ аbout love
