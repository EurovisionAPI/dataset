Slowly and quietly

The evening has fled all too fast
Outside the window night has come
The candles are burning low
The glasses have become much more than empty

The eyelids are heavy as lead
But no one pretends to understand
That time took it's top-hat
As the pianist struck the last note

We disappear slowly and quietly, into the warm night
Slowly and quietly, we walk the street home
Once, once again

Left are chairs, benches, tables
Broken glasses, spoken and unspoken words
Silence at last has its peace
Birds poeticise to the new day

We disappear slowly and quietly, into the warm night
Slowly and quietly, we walk the street home

Slowly and quietly, we walk the ѕtreet home
Slowly and quietly, through the warm night
Once, once agаin
