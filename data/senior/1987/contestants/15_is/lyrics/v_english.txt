One more song

Waiting for the night to pass me by
I'm feeling all alone, I've said goodbye
To my one and only friend
Why do good things always have to end?

I search my glass for some kind of a sign
No, I find no comfort in the wine
And the gleaming candlelight
Can't keep away the shadows of the night

I ask for one more song
Piano man, please play me just one more song
A simple, sad and lonely one
All I'm asking for is one more song

Did we have to use these heartless
Words
Or were they something I just
Overheard?
There's no reason to pretend
But why do good things always have to end?

I ask for one more song
Piano man, please play me just one more song
A simple, sad and lonely one
One more song Piano man, please me just one more song

A sad song that goes on and on
All I'm аsking for is one more ѕong
