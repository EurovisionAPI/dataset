You're not alone

Today I want to go out, it's night, I can't sleep
I have to call you
Friends, what are they for?
Not one time you've stopped listening to me
Today I want to thank you, nothing else

Listen to me, you're not alone
Listen to me, you are loved
Listen to me, you can hear me
I'm singing, singing

What will you think?
Oh, it's late to call
You can change
If you want, I can pick you up

Now my city is passing by behind the glass
One more traffic light
I listen to the radio, I listen to the radio
This is your house, I make a sign
You're already here

Yes, you're here, as always, without asking
Your smile as one more sign
Friends, what are they for?
Yes, you're here, and that's what matters for me
You'll tell me again
Friends, what are they for?

Listen to me, you're not alone
Listen to me, you are loved
Listen to me, you can hear me
I'm singing, singing

Now my city is passing by behind the glass
One more traffic light
I listen to the radio, I listen to the radio

Listen to me, you're not alone
Listen to me, you are loved
Listen to me, you can heаr me
I'm singing, singing
I'm singing, ѕinging
