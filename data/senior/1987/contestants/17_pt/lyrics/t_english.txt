In this sailing boat

In my country, there's a river
That runs non-stop
In my country, there's a ship
That doesn't always go out to sea
In my country, sadness is called loneliness
In my country, beauty is invented in my hand

I'm sailing an empty boat
That crosses the river to the dock of longing
I'm sailing on a very beautiful wave
In this ageless sailing boat

I'm sailing an overfull boat
In the middle of the path of hope
I'm sailing on a very beautiful wave
In this sailing boat with a childish look

In my country, there's a river
That runs non-stop
In my country, there's a ship
That doesn't always go out to sea
My country is a sun of anger and flowers
Even tough it has dark eyes
That are waiting for me

I'm sailing an overfull boat
In the middle of the path of hope
I'm sailing on a very beautiful wave
In this sailing boat with a childish look

I'm sailing an overfull boat
In the middle of the path of hope
I'm sailing on a very beautiful wave
In this sailing boat with a childish look

I'm sailing an overfull boat
In the middle of the path of hope
I'm sailing on a very beautiful wave
In this sailing boat with a childish look

I'm sailing an overfull boat
In the middle of the path of hope
I'm sailing on a very beautiful wave
In this sailing boat with а childiѕh look
