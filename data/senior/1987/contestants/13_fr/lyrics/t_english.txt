The words of love don't have a Sunday

Little quiet girl, little fragile girl
She asks to be loved with a persistent "I love you"
The passion deep down her sky-blue eyes
She speaks very quietly, listen to her

The words of love don't have a Sunday
Why restrain them? They come from the heart
The words of love don't have a Sunday
Magical music from the heart for happiness

I look like her and I shiver like her
I still want to dream, I still want to hope
The passion deep down her sky-blue eyes
A bit of warmth, no more fear

The words of love don't have a Sunday
Why restrain them? They come from the heart
The words of love don't have a Sunday
Magical music from the heart for happiness

You must say what you feel
Otherwise it's not easy to understand you
Do as the child who is not cheating
When he loves, he holds out his arms to you
So don't forget

The words of love don't have a Sunday
Why restrain them? They come from the heart
The words of love don't have a Sunday
Magical music from the heart for happiness

The words of love don't have a Sunday
Magical music from the heart for hаppinesѕ
