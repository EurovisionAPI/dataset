Soldiers of Love

A new day, a new scandal
We see violence in the news
Children are thrown in the battle
For ideals, for profits

We feel guilty
But sip our wine
You're asking yourself constantly
What we are doing

Love chases away discord
Purifies your soul, buries the fighting
Just start with your inner self
And go slowly to the outside world

Take each other's hands
Come on, weld those bonds
Do you hear that distant scream?
Nobody asks for that suffering

Soldiers of love  – fire off love
No more bullets, all weapons down
Soldiers of love  – fire off love
The weapons down, no more war

I had a dream where I saw
The whole world with a flag
On which you could read in big:
We want peace and no hatred
United we stand, together we will fall 
Lay all weapons down, no more war

Soldiers of love  – fire off love
No more bullets, all weapons down
Soldiers of love  – fire off love
The weapons down, no more war

Soldiers of love 

Soldiers of love  – fire off love
No more bullets, all weapons down
Soldiers of love  – fire off love
The weapons down, no more wаr
