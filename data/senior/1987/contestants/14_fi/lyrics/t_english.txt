One hundred lightnings

The white lands are getting darker, singing trees go silent
Children of the streets go into hiding when a storm is rising
Let's fear our fears away, nothing could take me away
When love sticks tightly to you and the heart gets warmer

Though a hundred lightnings strike fire, and all of life explodes
Nobody can take love away from me, there's always hope
When a hundred suns shine on us
And a ship is ready to depart
I will take our love to a safe place
And we'll find a new land

I feel tenderness beside you, a dream of an exhausted land
The last dream gives us shelter from the wind of the night
I see the truth in your hope, you create a flame by whispering
Only love will take us there, it saves us

Though a hundred lightnings strike fire, and all of life explodes
Nobody can take love away from me, there's always hope
When a hundred suns shine on us
And a ship is ready to depart
I will take our love to a safe place
And we'll find a new land

There's a thousand worlds out there, and one of them is ours

Though a hundred lightnings strike fire, and all of life explodes
I will take our love to a safe place
And we'll find a new land
I will take our love to a safe place
I will change thiѕ land to another white lаnd
