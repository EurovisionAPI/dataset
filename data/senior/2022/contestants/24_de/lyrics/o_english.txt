Rockstars

Look where we are
We used to be the rockstars
Who never thought of no harm
'Til this thing we call life stopped gleaming
I wish there was a way to go back dreaming
Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast
Wish there was a way to know that we're in
The good old days before we all just leave 'em

I tried getting rid of the pain
I tried to make it go away but it probably won't change
Always thinking 'bout my own worries
Remember back when we had no worries?
Now life just ain't hitting the same
I sit and miss and reminisce about innocent old days
When I was afraid of nobody
Now I'm afraid of being a nobody

Don't wanna leave my bed
I'll just stay and never get it together
'Cause the voices in my head
They keep saying it'll never get better

Look where we are
We used to be the rockstars
Who never thought of no harm
'Til this thing we call life stopped gleaming
I wish there was a way to go back dreaming
Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast
Wish there was a way to know that we're in
The good old days before we all just leave 'em

Sometimes I got this kinda sting that's right inside my chest
It's only purpose is convincing me that I'm a mess
And even though it's always been an uninvited guest
It finds a way in nonetheless
Wish I could change my address
And you know
Just be somebody else for a couple of days
Although I'm pretty sure we all feel the same kinda way
'Cause if you think about it
Aren't we all set in a place
Where we look back at better days
And wish they weren't so far away?

I wish that I could just go back and be the way I was
I wish I'd still not give a damn 'bout how I come across
I wish the way I saw myself had never gotten lost
In all the worries
All the thoughts
Overthinking
All the parts
So exhausted
Always caught
Up inside my doubts and flaws
And Imma count them all
Somebody catch me, I'm 'bout to fall
Yeah I'm 'bout to fall
Can we press pause?
Or do a restart
And be who we are?

We used to be the rockstars
Who never thought of no harm
'Til this thing we call life stopped gleaming
I wish there was a way to go back dreaming
Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast
Wish there was a way to know that we're in
The good old days before we all just leave 'em

(We used to be the rockstars)
Didn't we?
(We used to be the rockstars)
Didn't we
Use to be the rockstars? (We used to be the rockstars)
Yeah we used to be the rockstars (We used to be the rockstars)

Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast
Wish there was a way to know that we're in
The good old days before we all juѕt leаve 'em
