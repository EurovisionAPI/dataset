The Depth

Do you know the feeling that
That your dream doesn't come true?
Are you ever afraid
That it will always stay that way?
Because it rains every day
And I don't see a hand in front of me
You and I together
It always will be

Ta da da…

Here in the depth I hear your name over and over again
Oh my dear what am I supposed to do?
I'm deep and I don't want to let you go

I'm hiding under a table
And I hope you find me
I've been waiting all evening
Oh I look like a kid
I bite my teeth again
And I know you do the same
But God, what else am I supposed to do?
When it is enough?

Ta da da…

Here in the depth I hear your name over and over again
Oh my dear what am I supposed to do?
I'm deep and I don't want to let you go
No no, no no
Don't let you go

Ta da da…

Here in the depth I hear your name over and over again
Oh my dear what am I suppoѕed to do?
I'm deep and I don't wаnt to let you go
