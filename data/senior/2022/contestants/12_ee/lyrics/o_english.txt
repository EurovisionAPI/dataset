Hope

We let them tell us what to do
Why why why
We live to die for worthy things
Oh ya ya ya

We promised we would never lose our pride
Your word's worth nothing if you lie
We're standing tall and looking up, our Father would be proud
And I'm happy to be working my own ground

We'll be the last ones breathing here

Hey sing your heart out boy
For all the people great and small
Oh, when all else is lost
The future still remains our own

We're taught that we were born to lose
But why why why
Don't waste your breath, it's time to choose
Oh ya ya ya

We promised we would never lose our pride
Everyday they try to turn that into lies
We're standing tall and looking up, our Father would be proud
And I'm happy to be working my own ground

I said
Hey sing your heart out boy
For all the people great and small
Oh, when all else is lost
The future still remains our own

I hope I hope I hope
I hope I hope
I hope I hope I hope
I hope I hope

We let them tell us what to do
Why why why
We live to die for worthy things
Oh ya ya ya
No matter what they try, tearing up our lives
I know we will always rise

I said
Hey sing your heart out boy
For all the people great and small
Oh, when all else is lost
The future still remains our own

I hope I hope I hope
I hope I hope
I hope I hope I hope

The future still remаinѕ our own

I hope I hope I hope
I hope I hope
I hope I hope I hope
I hope I hope I hope
