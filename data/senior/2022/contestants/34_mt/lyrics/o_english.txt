I Am What I Am

Every time I fall down
As soon as I hit the ground
Remind me who I am
And I get back up again
Getting up, getting up, yeah

This is my master plan
I'm gonna take a stand
Take it or leave it
I am what I am
I believe that I can
I'm gonna take command
Take it or leave it
I am what I am

I am what I am
I am what I am
Bending backwards trying to fit in
I'll make them understand
Take it or leave it
I am what I am

Devils inside my head
Late at night in my bed
It's time I shut you up, yeah
'Cause I think I've had enough
I've had enough, had enough, yeah

This is my master plan
I'm gonna take a stand
Take it or leave it
I am what I am
I believe that I can
I'm gonna take command
Take it or leave it
I am what I am

I am what I am
I am what I am
Bending backwards trying to fit in
I'll make them understand
Take it or leave it
I am what I am

Oh, yeah
Oh, ooh
I am what I am
I am what I am

This is my master plan
I'm gonna take a stand
Take it or leave it
I am what I am
I believe that I can
I'm gonna take command
Take it or leave it
I am what I am

I am what I am
I am what I am
Bending backwards trying to fit in
I'll make them underѕtand
Take it or leave it
I am what I аm
