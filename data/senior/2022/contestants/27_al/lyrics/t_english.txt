Secret

Hey, do you remember those nights?
They remained only a secret

Come on, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Go

The boy is coming from the mountains
And he came here to find it
Goin' mad when I whine it
Come baby, come put my hands on your body
Come on closer to me, ya, me, ya
'Cause I love when you're near, near
Xhamadan with stripes, stripes
Come baby, put it on me, ya

Hey, I will never regret
You will be my secret
Baby, feel my body
Touch-touch it, I like it
Hey, I will never regret
You will keep my secret
But I do not know, do not know
How I am about to feel

I do not know, how you could leave me for another
And today, I want to say it to you
And one, and two
One, two, three, I'd die for you
(I'd die for you, I'd die for you)
(I'd die for you, I'd die for you)
Slower, slower, hey
Slower, slower, hey

You made my life like a game, a plane
He has left me, he has left me
You know I want it, give it to me
He has left me, he has left me

Hey, I will never regret
You will be my secret
Baby, feel my body
Touch-touch it, I like it
Hey, I will never regret
You will keep my secret
But I do not know, do not know
How I am about to feel

Hey (I do not know, how you could leave me for another)
Hey (And today, I want to say it to you)
Hey (And one, and two)
Na-аh (One, two, three, I'd die for you)
(I'd die for you, I'd die for you )
(I'd die for you, for you)
(I'd die for you, I'd die for you )
One, two, come on hey (I'd die for you, for you)

Get up

Slower, slower, hey
Slower, ѕlower, hey
