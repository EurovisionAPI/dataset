Stefania

Stefania mother mother Stefania
The field blooming up, and she turns gray
Sing me a lullaby mom
I want to hear your native word

She rocked me, gave me a rhythm, and probably they do not take away the strength of will out from me, because she gave
She probably knew more than Solomon
I will always come to you by broken roads
She will not wake me, she not woking me in strong storms
She will take two diddly-squats from her mother like they are bullets
She knew me very well, she was not being deceived, she rocked me when was very tired
Luli Luli Luli…

Stefania mother mother Stefania
The field blooming up, and she turns gray
Sing me a lullaby mom
I want to hear your native word

I'm not in diapers but ma no ma, enough, I must pay for things no matter how I grew up
I am not a child, but she still loses her temper, I walked, the slag would hit you
You are still a young mother at the peak if I do not appreciate the care at the peak of glory to me in a dead-end
Kill the peak of this peak, I would burn the peak, with your love
Luli Luli Luli…

Stefania mother mother Stefania
The field blooming up, and she turnѕ gray
