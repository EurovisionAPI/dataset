Boys Do Cry

In my room, lives a boy who could be blue
And you might never know, oh, oh
You think he's cavalier, he would shed more than a crocodile tear
If you'd go, oh

Hearts they get broken
God only knows why
And sometimes aeroplanes, fall down from the sky
And mountains they crumble and rivers they run dry
And oh, boys do cry

When night falls, and the moon is all we see
Don't fear the wolf that lives in me, oh, oh
You think he's tough enough, he would cry love till the sun comes up
If you go, ooh

Hearts they get broken
God only knows why
And sometimes aeroplanes, fall down from the sky
And mountains they crumble and rivers they run dry
And oh, boys do cry
And how they cry

Mountains they crumble аnd rivers they run dry
And oh, boyѕ do cry
