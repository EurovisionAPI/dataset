Hold Me Closer

No need to apologize
'Cause there's nothing to regret
Well this is not what I wanted
Guess all the good things come to an end

So baby bye bye
Wish you the best
But most of all I wish that I could love you less

Well maybe you're right
I'll find someone else
You say it isn't me but when did that ever help

Hold me closer
Although you'll leave before the sunrise
Might be bleeding, but don't you mind, I'll be fine
Oh it kills me
I found the right one at the wrong time
But until the sunrise
Hold tight
Hold tight

Maybe it happened too fast
I guess that I understand
You say that you've never felt this way for anyone
And that's why it scares you to death

So baby bye bye
Know it's for the best
Still I can't see how that would ease the pain in my chest

Hold me closer
Although you'll leave before the sunrise
I'll be bleeding but don't you mind I'll be fine
Oh it kills me
I found the right one at the wrong time
But until the sunrise

Could you just hold me tight
I know I have to let go but just give me the night

'Cause tomorrow will hurt
Hurt really bad
'Cause I'm about to lose the best I ever had

Hold me closer
Although you'll leave before the sunrise
I'll be bleeding but don't you mind I'll be fine
Oh it kills me
I found the right one at the wrong time
But until the sunrise

Could you just hold me tight
I know I have to let go but just give me the night

Can't you see that you found the right one at the wrong time
It wаs juѕt the wrong time
Hold tight
Hold tight
