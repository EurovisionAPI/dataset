That's Rich

Take your mirror off the wall
Ain't you gettin' bored of your reflection?
I'm tired of dodging all your calls
You wanna be the centre of attention

I'm gettin' sick of you now
Stop sending flowers
I'll just burn them all
You'll cry for hours
Always putting me down
Well I've got news for you
You said I'm using you now
Hey stupid

That's rich
When it's coming from you
And that's rich
Well I've got nothing to prove
That's rich
You think I dressed up for you
And that's rich
Bye bye fool
Bye bye fool
Bye bye fool

Used to think I need your help
To feel good, turns out I do it better
Think maybe you should please yourself
Because I'm over you I'll see you never

I'm gettin' sick of you now
Stop sending flowers
I'll just burn them all
You'll cry for hours
Always putting me down
Well I've got news for you
You said I'm using you now
Hey stupid

That's rich
When it's coming from you
And that's rich
Well I've got nothing to prove
That's rich
You think I dressed up for you
And that's rich
Bye bye fool
Bye bye fool
Bye bye fool

I think it's funny how you miss me when you never knew me
You were a lazy lover, I moved on to ones that move me
Loser lose your attitude, I'm doing good, that's on me
All glowed up yeah that's on me
You see me, now you want me?

(Now you want me?)
'Cause I don't need a lazy lover
(Now you want me?)
No, I don't wanna meet your mother
(Now you want me?)
Don't cry, I'm sure you'll meet another
And you'll tell her you love her

Well that's rich
When it's coming from you
And that's rich
Well I know all of your moves
That's rich
You think I dressed up for you
And thаt'ѕ rich
Bye bye fool
Bye bye fool
Bye bye fool
Bye bye fool
Bye bye fool
Bye bye fool
