Lights Off

I lost my soul, forgot my way
There's no mistakes that I've not made
Changes hurt and I'm alone
But people say, "My, how you've grown"

Try changing jobs, try changing lovers
Changing my furniture, change my bed covers
I've changed my heart, but there's not a chance
So turn the lights off

Where are you now when I miss you?
You're sailin' around in my peripheral
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

I'll ring the changes, make a plan
I'm small but mighty yes I can
I'll build a fortress, I'll be the wall
I'll be a queen, invincible

Try changing jobs, try changing lovers
Changing my furniture, change my bed covers
I've changed my heart, but there's not a chance
So turn the lights off

Where are you now when I miss you?
You're sailin' around in my peripheral
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Once again I'm left without control
I'm far away, but can you hear me call?
Where are you now?

Where are you now when I miss you?
You're ѕailin' around in my peripheral
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where аre you now?
