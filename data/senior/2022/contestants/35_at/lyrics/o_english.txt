Halo

Let me be your halo
'Cause we've been through hell and back in only one night
Let me be your halo
'Cause heaven can't wait for us to finish the fight

We don't need a Hercules to bring a man down to his knees
No more apologies
Philosophers like Socrates define yourself, think on your feet
Go sharpen your teeth

We can be CEO
Yeah, you already know
Yeah, we can be the boss
Fly higher than the Gods
We're not under control
And no, no, not anymore
If you feel me, then put your hands up

Let me be your halo
'Cause we've been through hell and back in only one night
Let me be your halo
'Cause heaven can't wait for us to finish the fight

And I'm stronger than angels
I'm fearless in danger
And I will bring dark to the light
Let me be your halo
'Cause we've been through hell and back in only one night

I think I had the right idea
Beautiful, something to feel
For a hundred years
We're gonna be written among the stars
Posing so we're hustling young queens

We can be CEO
Yeah, you already know
Yeah, we can be the boss
Fly higher than the Gods
We're not under control
And no, no, not anymore
If you feel me, then put your hands up

Let me be your halo
'Cause we've been through hell and back in only one night
Let me be your halo
'Cause heaven can't wait for us to finish the fight

And I'm stronger than angels
I'm fearless in danger
And I will bring dark to the light
Let me be your halo
'Cause we've been through hell and back in only one night

(La la la…)
Don't need no
(La la la…)

Let me be your halo
'Cause we've been through hell and back in only one night
Let me be your halo
'Cause heaven can't wait for us to finish the fight

And I'm stronger than angels
I'm fearless in danger
And I will bring dark to the light
Let me be your halo
'Cauѕe we've been through hell and bаck in only one night
