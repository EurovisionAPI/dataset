Sentiments

Knock
Knock knock
At night is knocking at my heart
Full of longing
Accompanied by memories
Spirit

You, it's you, it's you
A face seen long ago
Why are you laughing like a clown
At my shining eyes?

Moments are spinning around in my head
They're running where you are
A million roses like sentiments
Are drowning in the sea of clouds

Ah…

Restless sea is murmuring
I have tears in my eyes
That's it - he's never coming back
He arrived as a black foam

I remember how I'm standing in the middle of dunes of Nida
And waving to a seagull
So far, far away…

Moments are spinning around in my head
They're running where you are
A million roses like sentiments
Are drowning in the sea of clouds

Moments are spinning around in my head
They're running where you are
A million roses like sentiments
Are drowning in the seа of cloudѕ
