Eat Your Salad

Instead of meat I eat veggies and ðŸ™€
I like them both fresh, like them both juicy
I ride my bicycle to work instead of a car
All of my groceries are divided by weight and stored in glass jars
Got my reusable bag
That swag, my flex, my flag
Zero waste, that is my jam
Save fuel and sell your trucks
The karma comes for free and so does luck
All aboard the green Titanic
Let's sail the world and then cruise the Atlantic
No ice in the way, no need to panic
All the signs are there, let's go organic

Oh, when you eat your veggies
Baby, think of me
<i style="color:#789">Little kitty, don't you know that being green is cool?</i>

Know that being green is hot <i style="color:#789">â€“ It's hot</i>
Being green is cool <i style="color:#789">â€“ It's cool</i>
Eat your salad, save the planet
Being green is sexy as fâ€¦
Being green is hot <i style="color:#789">â€“ It's hot</i>
Being green is cool <i style="color:#789">â€“ It's cool</i>
Eat your salad, save the planet
Being green is sexy as you

Ring, ring, God damn, it's an exam, let's go!
Get your trash can, no backup plan and sort through it
Bend over, then jiggle that peach <i style="color:#789">â€“ Hey</i>
You're recycling while I'm loving those cheeks
I'm a beast instead of a killer, forget the hot dogs <i style="color:#789">â€“ What?</i>
'Cause my sausage is bigger
Three, two, one, all the girls go eco
If you want your man's tongue longer than a gecko's
