The Show

All the things you said when I was just a kid
Telling me that I, I needed to fit in
Year after year, I never understood
How you could've dropped me when I needed you the most

If this is what I want
That's how it's gonna be
I am not afraid of what's in front of me

You can try me
You can't stop me
And I will never let it go
I will keep up with the show
I'm not sorry
This is all me
And I will never let it go
I will keep up with the show

So you, you, you
You can try me

All the things that I, I wanted to forget
The worst thing you said kept playing in my head
You never followed and now you're blocked
And now and forever, I'll show you what I've become

If this is what I want
That's how it's gonna be
I am not afraid of what's in front of me

You can try me
You can't stop me
And I will never let it go
I will keep up with the show
I'm not sorry
This is all me
And I will never let it go
I will keep up with the show

You can try me
You can't stop me
And I will never let it go
I will keep up with the show
I'm not sorry
This is all me
And I will never let it go
I will keep up with the show

And I will never let it go
I will keep up with the ѕhow
So you, you, you (One, two, three, four)
You, you, you
You cаn try me
