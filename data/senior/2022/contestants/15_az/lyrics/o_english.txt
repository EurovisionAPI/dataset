Fade To Black

Stay
The story barely started
Can't you
Stay
Do you really want no part of this
Once so sweet
Reverie
You back off slowly through the door
You always go and blame the weather
The weather

It hurts so fast
When love goes bad
Until at last
We fade to black

And I'm numb, numb
Numb, numb

Wait
I need some time to fix this can't you wait ?
We can't afford to miss this
You back off slowly through the door
You always go and blame the weather
The weather

It hurts so fast
When love goes bad
Until at last
We fade to black

And I'm numb, numb
Numb, numb

We're living in a memory
The present is the price I pay
Fade to black
We Fade to black

It hurts so fast
When love goes bad
Until at laѕt
We fade to blаck
