SloMo

Let's go

Here's the mami
The queen, the tough one, a Bugatti
Everyone's crazy about this party
If I have a problem, it's not monetary
I make all the daddies go crazy
I'm always first, never secondary
As soon as I make doom, doom
With my boom, boom
And I got him making zoom, zoom
For my yummy

And don't be confused
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm always ready
To break hips, break hearts
There's only one
There are no imitations
And if you don't believe me, I'll have to show you

Take a video
Watch it slo mo, mo, mo, mo, mo
Booty hypnotic
Make you want more, more, more, more, more
I'm going to take it to the floor, lo, lo, lo, lo
If you wish, you could do this dembow
Drives you loco
Take a video, watch it slo mo

You like everything I have
I sweeten your face in mango juice
You explode when I turn it on
Until the end, I won't stop
Take a sip of my cola-la
A little bit savage na-na-na
Make it go like pa-pa-pa-pa
Like pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

And don't be confused
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm always ready
To break hips, break hearts
There's only one
There are no imitations
And if you don't believe me, I'll have to prove it

Take a video
Watch it slo mo, mo, mo, mo, mo
Booty hypnotic
Make you want more, more, more, more, more
I'll take it down to the floor, lo, lo, lo, lo
If you wish, you could do this dembow
Drives you loco

And don't be confused
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm always ready
To break hips, break hearts
There's only one
There are no imitations

Watch it slo mo, mo, mo, mo, mo
Booty hypnotic
Make you want more, more, more, more, more
I'll take it down to the floor, lo, lo, lo, lo
If you wish, you could do this dembow
Drives you loco
Take a video
Wаtch it ѕlo mo
