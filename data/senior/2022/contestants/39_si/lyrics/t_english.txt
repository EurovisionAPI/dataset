Disco

We were in the disco
When LPS played
Fičo was beeping again
Žvižej screwed up his solo

By then, I thought it was a good time
That you're looking away too much
This looked full of infidelity
I've been too familiar

Because I'm looking at you
When you're leaving without me on the other side
I want you
But you give the other heart away
We dance
But it's only in my dreams
No you're not coming back

I'm looking at you
When you're leaving without me on the other side
I want you
But you give the other heart away
We dance
But it's only in my dreams
No you're not coming back

They look at me from the wall pictures
They follow me every step of the way
It brings back memories
Of every heart soaked in tears
Each beat flows more slowly

You're still here
Even if you're not
That smell of yours
It wakes me up again every day

But from now on
I'm going to the disco myself
And watch the same movie
Only that I play my part

I'm looking at you
When you're leaving without me with the other side
I want you
But you give the other heart away
We dance
But it's only in my dreams
No, you're not coming, you're not coming back
You're gone, and I'm looking at you
When you're leaving without me with the other side
I want you
But you give the other heart away
We dance
But it's only in my mind thаt I'm sorry
No, it'ѕ not going to be
