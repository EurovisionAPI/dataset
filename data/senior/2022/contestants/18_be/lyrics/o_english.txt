Miss You

Sometimes I feel down
Sometimes I booze
Sometimes I fall
Sometimes I do wrong
One day I'm cool
One day I'm cold

And I've been trying to escape my past
Give up on the sadness that you left behind
I've been trying to erase my mind
You stay like a nightmare
When I close my eyes

Am I gonna miss you? no
Promise I won't miss you, no
I'm gonna break through, no
I'll never hate you
I'll never chase you

Sometimes I feel good
Sometimes I lose my mind and my soul
That's when I see you
And out of the blue I answer your call

And I've been trying to escape my past
Give up on the sadness that you left behind
I've been trying to erase my mind
But you stay like a nightmare
When I close my eyes

Am I gonna miss you? no
Promise I won't miss you, no
I'm gonna break through, no
I'll never hate you
I'll never chase you

Am I gonna miss you? no, no
Promise I won't miss you, no
I'm gonna break through, no
I'll never hate you
I'll never chase you

I gotta make it to the bright side
I've been lying when I said I'm fine
Wanna find a way to feel alive

Am I gonna miss you? no
Promise I won't miss you, no
I'm gonna break through, no
I'll never hate you
I'll never chase you

Never feel bad
When love is good
Life goes on
Don't wanna live my life
Waiting for your call

Sometimes I feel down
Sometimes I booze
Sometimeѕ I fаll
