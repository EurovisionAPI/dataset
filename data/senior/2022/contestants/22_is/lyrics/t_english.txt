With the Rising Sun

Heavy waves in a quiet soul
The heavy challenge wrapped in grief
Desire that attracts, burns like a bonfire
Lays in secret - a secret - there there

In the light change you can see
Beauty in freedom that moves closer
Even though the night is coming
And unspoken words, plague the mind - there there

In the dark winter – the sun rises
Melts the ice of the heart - so warm
In a dark winter - the dear spring
Warms your wings once more

Shadows of the long nights approach
Move lightly with each breath
Sings a little song in his chest
Spreads out and sighs - there there

In the dark winter – the sun rises
Melts the ice of the heart - so warm
In a dark winter - the dear spring
Warms your wings once more

And she manages to fly
Soars to the highest heights
And gets closer to
Finding inner peace

In the dark winter – the sun rises
Melts the ice of the heart - so warm
In a dark winter - the dear spring
Wаrms your wingѕ once more
