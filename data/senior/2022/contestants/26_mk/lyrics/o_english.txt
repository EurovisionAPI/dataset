Circles

I just want a healthy conversation
Get it right and fix this situation
Everything is crumbling down beneath us
We run around, run around in circles
Tell me is this our last temptation
Can we even fix this situation
Do I listen to my heart or mind, 'cause
We run around, run around in circles
Circles, circles
Oh, circles

You don't wanna test my limits
But something tells me you're not listening
Probably, you're going crazy
It's all you've been doing lately
You don't wanna test my limits
I gave you all, but you're not listening
Can you stop calling me baby
I've made up my mind already
We're running in circles

I just want a healthy conversation
Get it right and fix this situation
Everything is crumbling down beneath us
We run around, run around in circles
We run around in circles

You don't wanna test my limits
But something tells me you're not listening
Probably, you're going crazy
It's all you've been doing lately
You don't wanna test my limits
I gave you all, but you're not listening
Can you stop calling me baby
I've made up my mind already

We're running

I've made up my mind
I've made up my mind
Stop calling me baby
Crazy

You don't wanna test my limits
But something tells me you're not listening
Probably, you're going crazy
It's all you've been doing lately
You don't wanna test my limits
I gave you all, but you're not listening
Can you stop calling me baby
I've made up my mind alreаdy
We're running in circleѕ
