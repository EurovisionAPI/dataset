Die Together

I'm in your back seat
You are driving me crazy
You're in fully control
It's like you always know so
Are you having a good time?
Doesn't seem like you're all fine
We don't laugh anymore
And when we cry we do it on our own

It's been a lovely year for us
Yeah, that's what they say
It's been a hell of a year
And we've been living in fear
Close to giving up

But if we die together now
We will always have each other
I won't lose you for another
And if we die together now
I will hold you till forever
If we die together, die together now

I love you, say that you love me too
That's the only way we can get out of this hell we made

It's been a lovely year for us
Yeah that's what they say
It's been a hell of a year
And we've been living in fear
Close to giving up

But if we die together now
We will always have each other
I won't lose you for another
And if we die together now
I will hold you till forever
If we die together, die together

Take my heart and rip it out
Bring it to the other side
Take my heart and rip it out
Bring it to the other side

Take my heart and rip it out
Bring it to the other side
Take my heart and rip it out
Oh, take my heart and rip it out

'Cause if we die together now
We will always have each other
I won't loѕe you for аnother
And if we die together
I will hold you till forever
If we die together, die together now
