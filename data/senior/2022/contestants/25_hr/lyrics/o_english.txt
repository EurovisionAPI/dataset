Guilty Pleasure

Dreamt of you last night
Woke up, you weren't there
Five nights in a row
Of dreams I've never shared

You come without a warning
Early in the morning
Timing's never been our thing
Leaving me with guilt
The only souvenir you bring

I'm with him and you're a secret treasure
He's devotion, you're a guilty pleasure
I'm with him and this is real life, honey
Guess the joke's no longer funny

I'm with him until the death do us part
But it doesn't do for this hungry heart
I'm with him, but in my frantic head
You always come and say

Would you run away?
Would you run away with me?
Would you run away?
Would you run away?

One love is enough
That's all you ever get
Least that's what they tell you
Still, I can't forget

Eyes like burning ashes
'Til the sunlight flashes
Can't recall what I've been taught
Captivated by the thunderstorm
In which I'm caught

I'm with him and you're a secret treasure
He's devotion, you're a guilty pleasure
I'm with him and this is real life, honey
Guess the joke's no longer funny

I'm with him until the death do us part
But it doesn't do for this hungry heart
I'm with him, but in my frantic head
You always come and say

Would you run away?
Would you run away with me?
Would you run away?
Would you run away?

In this real life, there's no way
In this real life, I have to stay
In this real life, there's no way
In this real life

I'm with him and you're a secret treasure
He's devotion, you're a guilty pleasure
I'm with him and this is real life, honey
Guess the joke's no longer funny

I'm with him until the death do us part
But it doesn't do for this hungry heart
I'm with him, but in my frantic head
You always come and say, say, say

Would you run away?
Would you run away with me?
Would you run away?
Would you run away?

In this real life, there's no way
In this real life, I have to stay
In this real life, there's no way
In thiѕ reаl life
