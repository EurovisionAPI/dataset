The Little Train

The train's going, just like flying
From one country to another
It is going but confused:
What's the country? Are they fused?
Is it old or is it new?
Seems like one, but also two
Both together and apart
Are there two, or just one?

Hey ho, Let's go
Folklore and Rock'n'roll
The train's route is east to west
Chisinau – Bucharest

Both in that land and in this
We dance hora - it's a bliss
And in each country within
Magic's made with violin
When the train gets to a stand
Feels like almost the same land
Feels like went without a change
Home-to-home. What an exchange

Hey ho. Let's go!

Chisinau – Bucharest

Going quickly, going good
Train of our nationhood
But it cannot comprehend
What's the country? Where's the end?
Is it old or is it new?
Seems like one, but also two
Both together and apart
Are there two, or just one?

Hey ho. Let's go!
