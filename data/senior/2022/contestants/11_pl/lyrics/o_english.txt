River

Gonna take my body down
Right down, down, down to the river
Gonna take my body down
Let the water carry me away
Just float away
Oh ohh…

Bury all of my things
Bury me in my skin
All that I've done
Oh Lord, I'm done
Who'd wanna be a king
Pulling too many strings
All that I've done
Oh Lord, I'm done

Carry me away
I float away
In the river

Gonna lay my head right down
Right now, now, now and forever
Gonna lay my head right down
Let the water carry me away
Just float away

Bury all of my things
Bury me in my skin
All that I've done
Oh Lord, I'm done
Who'd wanna be a king
Pulling too many strings
All that I've done
Oh Lord, I'm done

Carry me away
I float away

In the river, oh ohh
In the river, oh ohh
In the river, oh yeah

Bury all of my things
Bury me in my skin
All that I've done
Oh Lord, I'm done
Who'd wanna be a king
Pulling too many stringѕ
All that I've done
Oh Lord, I'm done

Gonna tаke my body down
Right down, down
Down to the river
