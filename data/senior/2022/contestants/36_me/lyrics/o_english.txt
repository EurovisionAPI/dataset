Breathe

The pain will go away, they say
In the cloud's foam
You'll keep the things to feel their smell
Just to make you warm

No, nothing feels the same
The fear won't leave you anyway

The battle for the life
Is bigger than you know
To act so selfishly is unforgivable
The air is what they need
Air is what they breathe
They'll die without it
It's unforgivable

Breathe, breathe
Fight for your life
Breathe, breathe

Go to sleep and dream that we
We will be reborn
Our souls will find themselves again
In the sweat of the storm

No, nothing feels the same
The fear won't leave you anyway

The battle for the life
Is bigger than you know
To act so selfishly is unforgivable
The air is what they need
The air is what they breathe
They'll die without it
It's unforgivable
The air is what they need
The air is what they breathe
They'll die without it
It's unforgivable

Unforgivable, forgivable
Nothing would feel the same
Unforgivable, forgivable
We can't lose them
Have to save them
It's unforgivable
Breathe, breathe
Fight for your life
You better breathe

The air is what they need
The air is what they breathe
They'll die without it
It'ѕ unforgivable
