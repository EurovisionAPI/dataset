Give That Wolf a Banana

Ooh…

Not sure I told you but I really like your teeth
That hairy coat of yours with nothing underneath
Not sure you have a name so I will call you Keith
Oooh…
See where you're going but I don't know where you've been
Is that saliva or blood dripping off your chin?
If you don't like the name Keith imma call you Jim
Ooh…

And before that wolf eats my grandma
Give that wolf a banana
Give that wolf
Ooh
And before that wolf eats my grandma
Give that wolf a banana
Give that wolf

I like the scent of every meal on your breath
That hunger in you, I'm in danger now, I guess
Let's go to grandmas, you say grandma tastes the best
Ooh…

Give that wolf a banana

And before that wolf eats my grandma
Give that wolf a banana
