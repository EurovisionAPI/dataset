Longing, longing*

I've tried to write
A million other songs but
Somehow I can't move on, oh you're gone

Takes time, alright
And I know it's no one's fault but
Somehow I can't move on, oh you're gone

Longing
Longing
Nothing more that I can say
Says it in a better way

Longing
Longing
Nothing more that I can say
Says it in a better way

There's so much I carry with me
He was always my safe haven
And now nothing makes sense
I lost my best friend

And if it's not too much
I ask for signs
Only one word remains

Longing
Longing
Nothing more that I can say
Says it in a better way

Longing
Longing
Nothing more that I can say
Says it in a better way

Nothing more that I can say
Says it in a better way

I've tried, alright
But it's killing me inside
Thought you'd be by my side always
