Spark

Let's go

The night sprouts in the obscurity of the woods
The stars appear in the restless rustling
A feminine shadow twirls in the light of a torch

I dance, ignoring the wild animals
I steal the fire from their lustful eyes
And turn it into a song to be sung in unison
She dances with the devil, so what?
I dance with the devil, so what?

Burning and mud, burning, feast and mud
The forest vibrates at the touch of the dancing flame
Her enchanting magic ascends the great trees

I dance, ignoring the wild animals
I steal the fire from their lustful eyes
And turn it into a song to be sung in unison

Fearless in the middle of the clearing dances the spark
Raging souls spinning and spinning around her
Raging souls spinning and spinning around her
Lalalalalalaleno lalelalalo
Lalalalalalaleno lalelalalo
Lalalalalalaleno lalelalalo
Lalalalalalaleno lalelalalo

I dance with the devil, so what?
With the devil I dance
She dances with the devil, so what?
Lalalalalalaleno lalelalalo
Lalalalalalaleno lalelalalo
Lalalalalalaleno lalelalalo
Lalalalalalaleno lalelalalo

Fearless in the middle of the clearing dances the ѕpаrk
