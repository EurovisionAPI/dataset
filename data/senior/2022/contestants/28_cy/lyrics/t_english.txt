Come

Melodies ringing through my head when you lay eyes on me
The rush is from my perfect view, so heavenly
Come and charge me up like electricity
My remedy

All in my, in my head
All in my, lucid dreams
Take my pain away
Come come, come come

In my arms, live another day
In my arms, let's go further together
In my dreams, put on wings and fly
You can be my only one
Na-na-na-na-ni-aman

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh-ooh
Come, come, come
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh-ooh
Come, come, come

Chemistry
Moving to the beat in perfect harmony
I'll show you what's it's like beyond your fantasy
My remedy

All in my, in my head
All in my, lucid dreams
Take my pain away
Come come, come come

In my arms, live another day
In my arms, let's go further together
In my dreams, put on wings and fly
You could be my only one
Na-na-na-na-ni-aman

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh-ooh
Come, come, come
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh-ooh
Come, come, come

Oh…
Take my pain away
Come come, come come

In my arms, live another day
In my arms, let's go further together
In my dreams, put on wingѕ and fly
You can be my only one
Na-na-na-na-ni-amаn

Come, come, come
Come, come, come
