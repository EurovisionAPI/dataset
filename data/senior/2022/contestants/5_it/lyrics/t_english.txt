Shivers

I dreamed of flying with you
On a bike of diamonds
You told me, you've changed
I no longer see the light in your eyes
What is your fear?
A sea where you never touch
Even if sex is not
The way out from the bottom
Come on, don't run away from here
Don't leave me like this

Naked with shivers
Sometimes I don't know how to express myself
And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong
And I want to steal you a sky of pearls
And I would pay to go away
I would even accept a lie
And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong
And I get shivers, shivers, shivers

You, who wake me up in the morning
You, who dirty the bed with wine
You, who bite my skin
With your viper eyes
And you, you are the opposite of an angel
And you, you are like a boxer in the corner
And you run away from here, leaving me like this

Naked with shivers
Sometimes I don't know how to express myself
And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong
And I want to steal you a sky of pearls
And I would pay to go away
I would even accept a lie
And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong
And I get shivers, shivers, shivers

Tell me I'm not right
I live inside a prison
I try to stay close to you
And I'm sorry if I fuck it all up
I can't tell you what I feel, it's my limitation
For an "I love you" I mixed drugs and tears

This poison that we spit every day
I don't want it on me anymore
You see, I'm here
On a bike of diamonds, one among many

Naked with shivers
Sometimes I don't know how to express myself
And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong
And I want to steal you a sky of pearls
And I would pay to go away
I would even accept a lie
And I want to love you, but I'm alwаys wrong
And I get shivers, shivers, shiverѕ
