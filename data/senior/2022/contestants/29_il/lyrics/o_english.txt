I.M

Baby
Sometimes love can bring you down
But, honey
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
Remember who you are

You can call me crazy
Or just call my name
You can say that I'm stunning
It's not a shame
'Cause I know I am
I know I am, huh
'Cause I know I am
I know I am

I like this attitude
I like the game
You can say that I'm brave and never the same
'Cause I know I am
I know I am
'Cause I know I am
Huh, I know I am

Baby, come with me, follow me
Tell me if we can take it to the floor
Cause I'm the fire, the power
And if you're asking who's gonna take it all, all, all

You know I am
You know I am
'Cause I na-na-na-know I am
Am
And no one brings me down
I'm gonna take the crown
Give it to me now

I'm shameless and I'm spotless and I'm flawless
Always take it all 'cause I'm a winner, I don't want less
Going for the things I shouldn't, maybe I'm ferocious
Making you do what I want and I'm not even topless
It's going down for real
Twenty twenty-two, let's seal the deal
Is the new sex appeal
Bam-bam, this is how it feels

Baby, come with me, follow me
Tell me if we can take it to the floor
Ooh oh, I'm the fire, the power
And if you're asking
I was gonna take it all, all, all, all

You know I am
You know I am
'Cause I na-na-na-know I am
Am
And no one bringѕ me down
I'm gonna tаke the crown
Give it to me now
