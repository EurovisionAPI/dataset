In a Healthy Body

What is the secret behind Meghan Markle's healthy hair?
What could be the secret?
What is the secret behind Meghan Markle's healthy hair?
What could be the secret?
I think that secret is the deep hydration
As they say
One's skin and hair reveal everything clearly
For example: dark circles around eyes point out to liver issues
Dark spots around lips might mean you have an enlarged spleen
An enlarged spleen is not good, not pretty

Because an artist - she has to be healthy

She has to be healthy, be healthy
Be healthy, be be be be healthy
Be healthy, be healthy
Be healthy, she has to, has to, has to

It's such fortune that
The autonomic nervous system exists
So I don't have to control my heartbeats
Because the heart beats, it beats on its own
Nice days, bright colors of the skirt on my body
Of my skirt, my dog and I
We are taking a walk, counting our steps
The skirt goes around my leg
We are taking a walk and that's it
And it doesn't have to be better than that, the heart beats on its own
I put my trust in it, that it beats on its own
I put my trust in it, that it beats, that I breathe
God give me health, God give health, God give health
God give health

I don't have the health insurance

Oh, so how will they monitor me? In the name of health
And care about me? In the name of health
An artist is invisible. In the name of health
You don't see me, it's magic. In the name of health

An artist, she can be healthy

She can be healthy, be healthy
Be healthy, be be be be healthy
Be healthy, be healthy
Be healthy, she has to, has to, has to

In a healthy body, in a healthy body
In a healthy body, in a healthy body
In a healthy body, in a healthy body
The body is healthy, so what do we do now?
A sick mind in a healthy body
A sad soul in a healthy body
A deѕperate mind in a healthy body
A frightened mind in a healthy body
So whаt do we do now?
