I'm Walking the Streets in the Rain

My poor heart feels like breaking
'Cause I'll never see you again
Still, nobody knows I am crying
'Cause I'm walking the streets in the rain

My tears are mixed through the raindrops
And I feel like I can't stand the pain
Still, nobody knows I am crying
'Cause I'm walking the streets in the rain

I'm retracing your steps one by one
Oh, we walk down the street for so long
I can still see your face through my teardrops
While the rain whispers softly: "She's gone"

The tears and the rain will keep falling
Till you bring back the sunshine again
Still, nobody knows I am crying
'Cause I'm walking the streets in the rain

Still, nobody knows I am crying
'Cause I'm walking the streetѕ in the rаin
