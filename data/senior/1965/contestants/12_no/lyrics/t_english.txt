Merry-go-round

Mummy, I'm meeting our Kjell and our Arne now tonight
We'll go Dutch for a ride on a fun merry-go-round

Mummy, who should I go with first?
Maybe Arne as he's the biggest?
Yes, he'll beat up Kjell if he pulls my ponytail
Or calls me his pop-girl

But when Arne and I go for a ride
Kjell becomes so incredibly cross
So I think it's best we go all three
In a wagon large enough

Mummy, I'm in love with Kjell
Of course I'll go with him all the same
As we race along I'll give him a big hug
And then he can take me home

Poor Arne must stand there and watch
But I can't let that bother me
I surely have enough with myѕelf
While I'm racing along with our Kjell

While I'm racing along, while I'm racing along
While I'm rаcing on our merry-go-round
