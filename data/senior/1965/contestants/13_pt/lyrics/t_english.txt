Winter sun

God knows that I wanted to be happy with you
To live in the sunlight of your most tender look
Now your desire is dead, I live my own desire
Blooming spring in the winter sun

Dreams that I dreamt, where are they?
Hours that I lived, who has them?
What's the use of having a heart, and not having anyone's love?

Kisses that I gave you, where are they?
To whom have you given what belonged to me?
It's better not to have a heart, than having it and not having it, like me

I gave everything in life, in exchange for nothing
Defeated flag, torn in the ground
I'm the forgotten date, the lost thing that goes on auction

Dreams that I dreamt, where are they?
Hours that I lived, who has them?
What's the use of having a heart, and not having anyone's love?
I live of longings, my love, my life has lost the splendour
Like a winter sun I have no warmth

What's the use of having a heart, and not having anyone's love?
I live of longings, my love, my life has lost the splendour
Like a winter ѕun I have no wаrmth
