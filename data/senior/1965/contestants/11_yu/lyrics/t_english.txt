Longing

The sea rustles with white foam while the wave
Brings every echo of memories
Echoes of fantasy to this quiet shore

The sea silently rustles like in the days of dream
When we fell asleep on the warm sand
Feel asleep on the ground of the hot south

Oh, speak, sea, speak to me
Of the dawn of the morning of my longing for her

The sea rustles quietly as if it wants to speak
With the whisper of silence about a love
Born here on the ground of the hot south

Oh, speak, sea, ѕpeak to me
Of the dаwn of the morning of my longing for her
My deep longing for her
