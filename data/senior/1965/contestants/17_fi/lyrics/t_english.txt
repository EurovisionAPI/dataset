The sun sets in the west

In the morning the sun rose, brightening up my sky
The fulfilment of dreams rowed in the purple clouds…

Now the sun sets in the west, the evening has already arrived
The sun sets in the west, the loveless sun

I never thought that the evening would arrive so soon
Until I saw a blue bird heading south

I saw it and I understood it: The time of love is gone
When the sun sets in the west

I thought the sun of my happiness had halted in the sky
Until I saw a fading sparkle in the foam of fiery water

I saw it аnd I understood it: The time of love is gone
When the sun sets in the west
When the sun sets in the weѕt
