For your sake

For your sake I wear rustling skirts
For your sake I'm girlish, sensitive and coy
For your sake I have to be conquered every time
For your dream is to tame me, weak and shy
While I bravely resist

Every time, must be like then
Every time I give, you'd rather take
But my dream is to love in friendship
I'm tired of my femininity
For it makes you so broad-shouldered
I don't care for men, who are men
But for men, who are human

For your sake the comedy's over
For your sake it's time to take off the masks
For your sake your lover revolts
I'm not your prey, but peer
Human, I say it for your sake

For otherwise I'll ѕlide awаy
