It's enough

It's enough
I have enough of all the games with fire
I have enough of all the beautiful compliments
And presents, it's enough
I want to be happy
It's enough

What you promised me seemed so romantic
But soon that fairy tale appeared to be a deceptive appearance
And when you threw our love away that evening in May
That was enough

Maybe you loved me
I was so happy with you
That I gladly wanted to share my life with you
But that you're always lying
And cheating me consciously
Is unacceptable to a woman
Who, always faithful
Would tell you then:

It's enough
I have enough of all the games with fire
I have enough of all the beautiful compliments
And presents, it's enough
I want to be happy
It's enough

I've known many men
And also illusions

I don't believe in romances anymore, for a long time now
In the long term every adventure finds
Its ending in grief anyhow
That's enough

Yet I'm still dreaming of
A quite common man
One who can love me sincerely and unrestrained
I'm tired of flirting
Ready for true love
Because I'm still a young woman
Who, always faithfully
Would tell him then:

It's enough
I have enough of all the games with fire
Even though you don't give me аny nice compliments
The moments of luck
You give them enough
It's enough
It's enough
It'ѕ enough
