Go and tell love

Go and tell love
That I'm seventeen years old
Tell him that while dreaming
I'm waiting for him, I'm waiting for him, I'm waiting for him

Go and tell love
That he must come as a friend
And we'll see
If my heart, if my heart keeps him

You'll know better than me
Where to find him in the night
You'll know better than me
How to talk to him as a friend

Go and tell love
That before his awakening
My days are just like
Days and days without sun

But why, but for whom
Are the flowers of spring?
But why and for whom
Does my heart beat more often?

Go and tell love
That I'm seventeen years old
Tell him that while dreaming
I'm waiting for him, I'm waiting for him, I'm waiting for him
And that he muѕt think of me for а long time
