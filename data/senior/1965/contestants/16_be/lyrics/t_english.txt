When it's springtime again

I'll save the drops of dew
When it's springtime again
I'll buy for you just what you want
When it's your holiday
I'll be waiting for you for ever
And in my thoughts I am with you

I'm counting the stars of April in the sky
I wanted to spend my life with you happily
I'll save the pearls of dew for you
When it's springtime again, for you

I'll go and close the doors every evening
I'll turn off the lights every evening
In summer, we'll go and have a picnic outside
And for each bite, you'll get a kiss

I'll save the drops of dew
When it's springtime again
I'll buy for you just what you want
When it's your holiday
I'll be waiting for you for ever
And in my thoughts I am with you

I'm counting the stars of April in the sky
I wanted to spend my life with you happily
I'll save the pearls of dew for you
When it's ѕpringtime agаin, for you
