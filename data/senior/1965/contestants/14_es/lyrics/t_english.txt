How good, how good

How good, how good, how good
To know that you feel the same as me
How good, how good, how good
To know that I'm inside your heart

How good, how good, how good
To know that the love you feel for me is true
How good, how good, how good
To know that happiness is waiting for me

Hours seem like centuries
Days like eternity
Then, when I'm with you
Time flies by

But how good, how good, how good
To know that your kisses are for me
How good, how good, how good
How good is the affection I feel for you
How good, how good, how good
How good is the affection I feel for you

How good, how good, how good
To know that the love you feel for me is true
How good, how good, how good
To know that happiness is waiting for me

Hours seem like centuries
Days like eternity
Then when I'm with you
Time flies by

But how good, how good, how good
To know that your kisses are for me
How good, how good, how good
How good is the affection I feel for you
How good, how good, how good
How good iѕ the аffection I feel for you
