Absent Friend

A night of spring is a lovely thing
But I feel sad in this night of spring
For this is the time the sloe gets bright
And this is a most bewitching night
And I am lonely and you are far
And you can't hear what I sing

I wish I knew where you are tonight
I wish you're thinking of me tonight
Where are you tonight?
I wish you feel how I long for you
And I wish you're missing me too
And I wish I knew where to go
Knowing you
Knowing you

We ought to walk where the cowslips grow
Behind the hedge of candescent sloe
And you ought to smile and look at me
And I ought to kiss you tenderly
But I don't know if you still are mine
This lovely evening of spring

I wish I knew where you are tonight
I wish you're thinking of me tonight
Where аre you tonight?

I wish you feel how I long for you
And I wish you're missing me too
And I wiѕh I knew where to go
Knowing you
Knowing you

Tonight
