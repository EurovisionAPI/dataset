No, forever without you

No, for the lost time that I only wanted you
No, for the passed time that I only thought of you
Go, you see, it's already tomorrow
Go, you understood nothing
Go, you see, I don't cry
Today I tell you

No, for the big roads along which I came back to you from far away
No, for the summer nights that only made you dance
Go, until the end of the horizon
Today it's no

No, because one morning nothing will be left of you
No, the day of another love without you will come
Go, you see, it's already tomorrow
Forever without you
Go, you see, it'ѕ alreаdy tomorrow
Forever without you
