Ok mama you know
They can say what they want you should let it go
Cause tonight I will show love
I'll show them I can dance on my own

They say I lost my way
Lost my way ? Never lost my way oh no
I know where I go don't care what they say
Never care what they say, oh no
I'm high I'm lifted like sir Bob Marley
Bob Barley oh yeah
I'm about to show them all imma kill it
Ali Boomaye oh yeah

Imma put my heart on the stove
Let y'all feel the heat
You'll be playing with the fire 
If you dance with me
I wasn't always like that 
I wasn't born like that
I just work like that
24/7

Ok mama you know
In this concrete jungle I wasn't easy to grow up
Nah Nah Nah
But every time they pushed me down 
I answered with this smile and I got up
Like you told me

Imma put my heart on the stove
Let y'all feel the heat
You'll be playing with the fire 
If you dance with me
I wasn't always like that 
I wasn't born like that
I just work like that

And I don't care if they don't like me
All I do is dance I don't care about their fighting
Why they fighting
