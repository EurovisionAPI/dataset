Nightingale

Oh, I went down into the valley
To pick guelder roses
Oh, I went down into the valley
To pick guelder roses
I gathered the flowers
Braided them into a wreath
Braided them into a wreath
The rue and periwinkle flowers
To me Vanyusha
There came out from the grove
To me Vanyusha
You, Katrusya, is pretty
My dear Katrusya
I love you
I love you
For as long as mother doesn't know

Nightingale, nightingale, do not sing so early
For my heart is not merry yet again
Nightingale, nightingale, oh what am I to do
I came to love him - and cannot forget him

If I hadn't known this
I wouldn't have gone with you
Wouldn't have gone down into the valley
Wouldn't have broken the guelder rose
I love you
For as long as mother doesn't know
And once mother finds out, we will part

Do not sing so early
Not merry yet again
Oh what am I to do

Nightingale, nightingale, do not sing so early
For my heart is not merry yet again
Nightingale, nightingale, oh what am I to do
I came to love him - and cannot forget him

Nightingale, nightingale, do not sing so early
For my heart iѕ not merry yet again
Nightingale, nightingale, oh what am I to do
I came to love him - and cаnnot forget him
