Looking Back

We would fall asleep
Talking 'bout our dreams
Waiting for eighteen
Is never what it seems

We were young and naive
Didn't know what we need
We were in such a rush to grow up

We were restless, confused
Summer nights on the roof
Didn't know what was in front of us

Chasing the high life
Stuck in the low lights
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back

Speeding through red lights
We had a good ride
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back

All these memories
Made me feel at home
When I walk these streets
I'm the only one, I know

We were young and naive
Didn't know what we need
We we're in such a rush to grow up

Now it's too late to save
All the seasons have changed
Didn't know what was in front of us

Chasing the high life
Stuck in the low lights
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back

Speeding through red lights
We had a good ride
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back

Chasing the high life
Stuck in the low lights
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back

Speeding through red lights
We had a good ride
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back

Yeah we never know what we have
Until it'ѕ over and we're looking bаck
