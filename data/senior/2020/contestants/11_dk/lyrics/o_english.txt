Yes

I was six feet under for the one and only
Spent the nights feeling bitter, sad and lonely
Didn't realize how much fear controlled me
Until you came and loved me like I'm holy
Now I'm ready to give life one more chance

Think my heart is beating me to death
I have got an arrow through my chest
I am so in love, I must confess
Say yes, say yes, say yes
Think my heart is beating me to death
I have got an arrow through my chest
I am so in love, I must confess
Say yes, say yes
Uuh, uuh, uh

Never thought I would be high on life but sober
Didn't think that I'd be able to turn this over
Let's make stories to talk about when we're older
Come and rest your pretty head upon my shoulder
Now I'm ready to give life one more chance

Think my heart is beating me to death
I have got an arrow through my chest
I am so in love, I must confess
Say yes, say yes, say yes
Think my heart is beating me to death
I have got an arrow through my chest
I am so in love, I must confess
Say yes, say yes
Uuh, uuh, uh
Say yes, say yes, say yes
Uuh, uuh, uh

Let's make stories to talk about when we're older
Come and rest your pretty head upon my shoulder
Uuh, uuh, uh
Say yes, say yes (say yes)

Think my heart is beating me to death
I have got an arrow through my chest
I am so in love, I must confess
Say yes, say yes, say yes
Think my heart is beating me to death
I have got an arrow through my chest
I am so in love, I must confess
Say yes, say yes

Think my heart is beating me to death
I have got an arrow through my chest
I am so in love, so just sаy yeѕ
