Running

I don't feel like talking, let me sit here alone
The phone's calling, I can't pick it up 

I'm tired of running from these demons (demons)
I'm tired of running from these demons, I can't see any more 
I can't see anymore

But I keep on running, I keep on running
I keep on running away
Now I keep on running, I keep on running
I don't wanna fall again

Drowning out my memories, from the night before 
Door's knocking, just leave me alone

I'm tired of running from these demons
I'm tired of running from these demons, I can't see any more 
I can't see anymore

But I keep on running, I keep on running
I keep on running away
Now I keep on running, I keep on running
I don't wanna fall again

Looking - losing
My energy - tripping
Anybody tow me back home

Yeah yeah
Standing naked
Putting on fake smiles
I don´t wanna be ѕad anymore

I don't wanna fall again 

I'm not gonna fall agаin
