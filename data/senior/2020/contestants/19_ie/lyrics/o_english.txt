Story Of My Life

Everybody told me that I'd never be someone
I'm not a puppet on a string, no, no I'm not
And everybody said that I was always breaking rules
Why would I ever wanna put myself outside the box

I don't care what they say
And who are they any-y-way

The story of my life it's mine
I made it on my own that's right
And I'll sing, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey
My life, it's my, my, my life it's mine

They said if I was blunt that I could make it, so I did it
Then they said, "You're almost perfect, but you talk too much", ha
Try and dumb it down a little, mix your legs around the middle
Rock it all you want, but make it popping off

I don't care what they say
And who are they any-y-way

The story of my life it's mine
I made it on my own that's right
And I'll sing, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey
My life, it's my, my, my life
It's the story of my life, that's right
This part of me that meets the eye
And I'll sing, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey
My life, it's my, my, my life, it's mine

My life, yeah, I'm gonna be me, yeah
I'm gonna believe it's right
My life, yeah, I gotta be me
I gotta believe it's right

The story of my life it's mine
I made it on my own that's right
And I'll sing, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey
My life, it's my, my, my life
It's the story of my life, that's right
This part of me that meets the eye
And I'll sing, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey
My life, it's my, my, my life, it's mine

My life, yeah, I'm gonna be me, yeah
I'm gonna believe it's right
My life, yeah, I gotta be me
I gotta believe it's right

I don't care what you ѕаy
