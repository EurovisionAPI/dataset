Move

We try we fight
We fall it's alright
That's life
oh life

We wipe those eyes
And then we rise
That's life
oohoo life

Even when the rain is falling
Even when you hit the bottom
I'll be there
I'll be there

'Cause there ain't no ocean
Deeper than my love for you

And there ain't no fire
That I wouldn't run right through

There ain't no mountain
Baby that I wouldn't move

Nothing that I wouldn't do for you
'Cause you do it for me too

Oho oho ho
Oho oho ho
Oho oho ho
Oh

'Cause you do it for me too
Oho oho ho

When highs turn low
I'll guide you home
That's right
damn right

Even when the rain is falling
Even when you hit the bottom
I'll be there
I'll be there

'Cause there ain't no ocean
Deeper than my love for you

And there ain't no fire
That I wouldn't run right through

There ain't no mountain
Baby that I wouldn't move

Nothing that I wouldn't do for you
'Cause you do it for me too

Oho oho ho
Oho oho ho
Oho oho ho
Oh
'Cause you do it for me too

Everybody wanna move like us
Everybody wanna move like us
Everybody wanna move like us
We're moving mountains

Everybody wanna move like us
Everybody wanna move like us
Everybody wanna move like us
We're moving mountains

'Cause there ain't no ocean
Deeper than my love for you

And there ain't no fire
That I wouldn't run right through

There ain't no mountain
Baby that I wouldn't move

Nothing that I wouldn't do for you
'Cause you do it for me too

Oho oho ho
Oho oho ho
Oho oho ho
Oh
We're moving mountains

Everybody wanna move like us
Everybody wanna move like us
Everybody wanna move like us

We're moving mountаinѕ
