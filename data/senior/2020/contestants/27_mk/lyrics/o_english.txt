You

Hand on my hand
Fingertips trembling
This feeling I can't understand
Your eyes sing to me
Pulling me closer
And closer with sweet melodies

Sing it to me, sing it to me, oh
We might only have tonight
Hold me tight and let's ignite
And for the moment, I

I just wanna dance with you
Tonight I wanna
I just wanna dance with you
You know you wanna
I just wanna dance with you
Tonight I wanna
I just wanna dance with you
You know you wanna

My lips find yours
And just like a muse
You're taking over me
I like it
I want more

(Sing it to me, sing it to me)

Oh
We might only have tonight
Hold me tight and let's ignite
And for the moment, I

I just wanna dance with you
Tonight I wanna
I just wanna dance with you
You know you wanna
I just wanna dance
Tonight
(Give it to me baby)
(Give it to me baby)
(Give it to me baby)
Give it to me, give it to me

(I wanna dance, dance, dance with you)
(I wanna dance, dance, dance)
I just wanna dance with you
Tonight I wanna
I juѕt wanna dance with you
You know you wanna
I wanna dаnce with you
