Cleopatra

Cleopatra was a queen like me
Just like me, yeah, just like me
Straight or gay or in between
In between, yeah, in between
Betrayed by a lover
So hard to recover
Couldn't see the forest for the trees
Just like me, oh, in too deep

There was no intervention
I was lost, falling out with myself
I was so filled with tension
Getting mad was my cry for help
Now I'm back with a vengeance
I've found my inner voice again
And it speaks to my soul loud and clear
And it sounds like this…

Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō
Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō
Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō
Like Cleopatra
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, like Cleopatra
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, like Cleopatra

Cleopatra had Mark Antony
You know who I mean, not the Latin king
The one from Rome who lived long ago
After Caesar died, Cleo's gigolo
Part Goddess, part temptress
The way he left me, it was shameless
She was her own worst enemy
Just like me, yeah, just like me

But now I'm back with a vengeance
I've found my inner voice again
And it speaks to my soul loud and clear
And it sounds like this…

Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō
Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō
Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō
Like Cleopatra
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, like Cleopatra
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, like Cleopatra

Sound-sounds like this
I can feel her spirit run through me
I can see it in my mind like a movie
Egyptian and Latin, the voiceѕ run through me
Come to me

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, like Cleopatra
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, like Cleopatra
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, like Cleopatra
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, like Cleopatrа
