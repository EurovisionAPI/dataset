Attention

I find myself longing for attention
I'm not myself doing what I do
I know I may have hurt someone I love along the way
It wasn't my intention
I lost myself doing what I do

I, just want your attention
Ohh, the crazy things I do

So why, why do I think it's okay
Not being me 'cause of you?
And what do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do
To get your attention?
'Cause I just want your attention

I fool myself just to make you happy.
And when I do, it's all the same to you

Ohh, the crazy things I do

So why, why do I think it's okay
Not being me 'cause of you?
And what do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do
To get your attention?

Ohh, I don't wanna do this no more
If I'm the only one here on the dance floor
On the dance floor
Ohh…

Why?
Why do I think it's okay
Not being me 'cause of you?
And what do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do
To get your attention?

'Cause I juѕt want your аttention
