Release Me

Release me
Don't talk, go away
Release me
It's not right to make me stay
All the lies and all the pain
Only you can make them go away
Yeah, release me from this sad and losing game

Release me
Don't say what I already know
Release me
Only trouble steals the show
All those words won't comfort me
It's clear we're not meant to be
Yeah, release me from this sad and losing game

You're all I want
A dangerous need
It's wrong to keep you close to me
And if you dare, if you care
Then cut the ropes and float away
Yeah, release me
If you love me, let me go!

Oh, release me, yeah, release me
From this sad and losing game
Oh, release me, yeah, release me
From this sad and loѕing gаme
