All of My Love

Never had the heart to pray
I never thought I'd find the way
But now I do
Now I do
Always felt I was no good
Always felt misunderstood
But now I don't
Now I don't

'Cause your great love is healing me
Renewing me through and through
I am free to live, so I give you

All of my love
Like a river runnin' wild
Every brother, mother, child
Now we found each other don't let me down
All my love
Like a river runnin' wild
Every brother, mother, child
Now we found each other don't let me down
All my love

All the love I feel for you

All the love I feel for you, yeah

Now I know your words are true
My heart is filled with gratitude
It's only you, I'm living for
Your amazing love, so sweet
Has raised me to my feet
I ain't going back anymore

Now I sing about you, dream about you
All the time
Don't wanna live without you, so I give you
