Hasta la vista

One, two, three and it's the end
your time is up
hands up on my sign
you're with her again, again, you're with her

I'm sleepless because of you
the silence is killing me
You and me will stay
with empty looks,
you with no heart, I with no sleep

Though I might be a bit crazy sometimes
but dating me is never boring
But you always pick the wrong one for yourself
now, my love, take it or leave it

Hasta la vista, baby
I have a new plan, I have, I have a new plan
Hasta la vista, baby
It's crystal clear, clear, it's crystal clear
Say "thank you" to me for loving you
for falling for a guy like you
Oh, well, sorry you didn't like me
Hasta la vista, baby

One, two, three and it's the end
your time is up
hands up on my sign
you're with her again, again, you're with her

I'm sleepless because of you
the silence is killing me
This is not vanity
when it comes to love, it's cute but psycho

Though I might be a bit crazy sometimes
but dating me is never boring
But you always pick the wrong one for yourself
now, my love, take it or leave it

Hasta la vista, baby
I have a new plan, I have, I have a new plan
Hasta la vista, baby
It's crystal clear, clear, it's crystal clear
Say "thank you" to me for loving you
for falling for a guy like you
Oh, well, sorry you didn't like me
Hasta la vista, baby

Oh yes, like it or not, I want to give myself to you
and may the world turn around
You and me on the edge of insanity when I say it's the end
when I say it's the end

Hasta la vista, baby
I have a new plan, I have, I have a new plan
Hasta la vista, baby
It's crystal clear, clear, it's crystal clear
Say "thank you" to me for loving you
for falling for a guy like you
Oh, well, sorry you didn't like me
Hasta la vista, baby

I have, I have a new plan
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la, Hasta la vista baby
Baby ooh
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la viѕta, bаby
