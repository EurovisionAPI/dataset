Answer Me

Why the rain
And the clouds, too
And the clouds, too
Why at night
You fall asleep in my bed
You fall asleep in my bed
Why do we sleep
So far away from the family
In another country
Why does death
Come after life
Come after life

Answer me

Without ever stopping
Without ever stopping
Why do we pray
All in our own ways
All in our own ways
Why am I
A stranger here
A stranger over there
Why will my son
Grow up without summer
Grow up without summer
