Alive

Shackle bolts
Around all these thrones come screaming
Behind a wall of egos
There is a hidden hero in us, in us
In all of us

You make me feel like, oh-oh-oh
You make me feel like, oh-oh-oh
You make me, you make me feel like, oh-oh-oh
You make me feel like

You make me feel alive
You make me feel like I'm alive again, alive again
Only you can make me feel alive again, alive again

I'm like a little match box
All I need is a little spark
To light this whole world up
Prepare for fire shots
Only you can make me feel alive again, alive again

Sticks and stones, oh-oh
Might break all I own
Come beat it
Behind a wall of egos
There is a hidden hero in us, oh-oh-oh

You make me feel like, oh-oh-oh
You make me, you make me feel like, yeah, oh-oh-oh
You make me feel like

You make me feel alive
You make me feel like I'm alive again, alive again
Only you can make me feel alive again, alive again

I'm like a little match box
All I need is a little spark
To light this whole world up
Prepare for fire shots
Only you can make me feel alive again, alive again

I give you fire shots
Shackle bolts hidden around
Everybody sing, come on
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh

You make me feel alive
You make me feel like I'm alive again, alive again, oh-oh

It'ѕ overthrown
And I'm on my own
Alive agаin
