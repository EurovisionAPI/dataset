Don't Break Me

I don't feel the same buzz
When your name comes up on my phone anymore
Feels like I don't feel you
I fear you
And it makes me cry on my floor

It feels like you're taking me for granted
I've given you everything I have, yeah
And I can barely bring to mind
The reason why I've stretched myself so far for you

Oh, oh, oh
I can't take it anymore

Don't break me
Don't break me down, down, down, down
Don't break me
Are you hearing me now, now, now, now
You thought I was elastic
But maybe I'm just made of glass
Don't break me
Don't break me down

Isn't love a compromise
Two people trying to keep the fire burning
You've been busy playing round and starting fights
While I've been busy earning
Every time that I try to explain it
You think that your pain is more important
And the hardest thing is that I don't wanna give you up
I love you, I love you, I love you

But oh, oh oh
I can't take it anymore

Don't break me
Don't break me down, down, down, down
Don't break me
Are you hearing me now, now, now, now
You thought I was elastic
But maybe I'm just made of glass
Don't break me
Don't break me down

I lie awake while you're asleep
I listen to the sound
Of all the words I couldn't say 'til now

Don't break me
Don't break me down, down, down, down
Don't break me
Are you hearing me now, now, now
You thought I was elastic
But maybe I'm just made of glasѕ
Don't break me
Don't break me down
Don't breаk me
