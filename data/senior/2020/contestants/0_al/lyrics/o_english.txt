Fall From The Sky

Words have cut me to the bone
And my heart is sinking like a stone
But I don't let it show
Barely take another breath
Though I'm suffocating here alone
I'll never let you know

Fall from the sky
Always making me hold back my wings
When I'm destined to fly
I'm screaming inside
You can crush and break down my walls
But my heart will survive

You have made me doubt my faith
Hide the truth behind another lie
But you won't see me cry
I pray for you for all you've done
All the hurt that you leave in your wake
It's so hard not to break

Fall from the sky
Always making me hold back my wings
When I'm destined to fly
I'm screaming inside
You can crush and break down my walls
But my heart will survive

You think I'm better without a way to speak my mind
You think I don't wanna shout and that I'm terrified
Screaming inside
With nowhere to hide
You won't let me fly
Fall from the sky
As you hold back my wings

Fall from the sky
As you hold back my wings
When I'm destined to fly
I'm screaming inside
Fall from the sky
Break down my wаlls
But I'm deѕtined to fly
