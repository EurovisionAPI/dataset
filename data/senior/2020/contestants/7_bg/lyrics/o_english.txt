Tears Getting Sober

Great, feel my head is taking over me
Ten déjà vus a day
and each time I'm getting colder,
pain, I should let it go

Your lies burn like sugar in my wounds
In time my wound will be a scar

Strained but my tears are getting sober now
and I've been here before so,
weight that I'm holding on my shoulders,
I'm gonna let it go

This is my first time trying
Look how the tables turn
I've got this dirt inside me
I've got some space to grow

Your lies burn like sugar in my wounds
So I have sweet bruises
In time I'll forget what you have done
In time my wound will be a scar

My pain will soon be over
Oh, how the tables turn
Tears are getting sober
I got some space to grow

Your lies burn like sugar in my wounds
So I have sweet bruises
In time I'll forget what you have done
In time my wound will be a ѕcаr
