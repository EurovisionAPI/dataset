On Fire

I'm a human not a stone
I can make a change and go
Wherever I want to

They told me maybe I'm too old
But there's fire in my soul.

The heat is getting higher
I feel that I'm on fire
The world is my desire
I feel that I'm on fire

There's no doubt I'm strong enough
To reach the state I've dreamed of
It's gonna happen

And I will do what I can
Just to be a better man

The heat is getting higher
I feel that I'm on fire
The world is my desire
I feel that I'm on fire

Can't believe it took so long
To take action and move on
No one can stop me

Through the clouds there comes the sun
And I'm ready for some fun

La la la la la… 

The heat is getting higher
I feel that I'm on fire
The world is my desire
I feel that I'm on fire

(on fire)
(on fire)

The heаt iѕ getting higher
