Grow

When I'm sad
I am unreasonable
Just like a little kid
Mad at the world

When I'm alone
I am defenceless
Just like the boy I was
Afraid in the dark

Don't take it personally
Don't be offended
Don't mind my mood
Changing like the weather
God knows I try to hold it all together
Oh, I'm getting older
And it ain't what I thought it would be

Wide awake
The planet spins around
A little too fast for me
Most of the time

Lost control
My thoughts are flickering
Just like satellites
Lost in the sky

Don't take it personally
Don't be offended
Don't mind my mood
Changing like the weather
God knows I try to hold it all together
I'm getting older
And it ain't what I thought it would be

One day I'll find
Some peace of mind
And then I'll stop being afraid
I won't make it through the night

The more I learn
The less I know
Through every high and every low
Oh, oh, the more I learn (Grow)
The less I know (Grow)
Through every high and every low (Grow)
I'll grow, oh-oh
The more I learn (Grow)
The lesѕ I know (Grow)
Through every high аnd every low (Grow)
I'll grow, oh-oh
