What Love Is

How mysterious this life can be
Full of beautiful surprises
I never really knew the man I thought was me

Dreams that I believed
Convinced my destiny
I was meant to be alone

But how can you know how a star looks
If you've never looked at the sky
I couldn't have told you what blue is
Till I looked into your eyes,
Or how soft the feel of a cloud is
'Till I was touching your skin
The world is a wonder of wonders I'd never seen

I never imagined the power
I never imagined the need
I never imagined what love is
Now love is all I dream
How wonderful was the awakening
Now everything is the sunrise
Painted in sounds of your breathing
Colored by your signs
I never knew
What it was to - love

Much too sensible too reasonable
Ever to believe in miracles

But now you've come to me
Changed my destiny
I'll never be alone

I never imagined the power
I never imagined the need
I never imagined what love is
Now love is all I dream

I never imagined the power
I never imagined the need
I never imagined what love is
Now love is all I dream

I never imagined the power
I never knew
What it wаѕ to - love
