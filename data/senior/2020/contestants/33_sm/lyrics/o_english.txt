Freaky!

So, when you touch me, I feel your love all over my body
(Body, body, body, body)
You make me feel like I'm spinning from the way that you want me
(Want me, want me, want me, want me, want me, want)

Put on a show, co-co-completely
Some people think our love is freaky, freaky, freaky
They say we cray, I must be faking
But you and I, we like it freaky, freaky, freaky

Drinks on rooftops and kiss in the dark
Dance around late at night in the park
Sparkle it up, dressing in colours
'Cause life is good when we're freaky, freaky, freaky

So, when you touch me, I feel your love all over my body
(Body, body, body, body)
You make me feel like I'm spinning from the way that you want me
(Want me, want me, want me)

Yeah, we wanna break all the rules
And make up some new
Then we'll destroy all of them too
'Cause that's what we do, oh yeah
And life goes by too quickly now not to be freaking it up
Freaking it up
Freaky, freaky, freaky

Drinks on rooftops and kiss in the dark
Dance around late at night in the park
Sparkle it up, dressing in colours
'Cause life is good when we're freaky, freaky, freaky

Freaky, freaky, freaky
Freaky, freaky, freaky

They say we cray, I must be faking
But you and I, we like it freaky, freaky, freaky
Sparkle it up, dressing in colours
'Cause life is good when we're freaky, freaky

Yeah, we wanna break all the rules
And make up some new
Then we'll destroy all of them too
'Cause that's what we do, oh yeah
And life goes by too quickly now not to be freaking it up
Freaking it up (Freaky, freaky, freaky)
