Until Dawn

I braided the autumn and then unbraided it
I got lost, for winter covered the late paths with snow
I asked myself why I needed the one that I had not chosen
I stayed confused until dawn, dark night full of secrets and passion

Until dawn, until dawn I wasn't yet alone
Until dawn, until dawn the clear moon kept bringing us together
Until dawn, until dawn the clear moon kept bringing us together
Until dawn, until dawn I wasn't yet alone

I wasn't the one to blame for not being on my own

Oh I did not stay a girl for long, my youth passed me by
Oh how early, oh so early, did you bloom, my white rose, and to whom?
Oh mamma, why do I need the one that I have not chosen
I stayed confused until dawn, dark night full of secrets and passion

Until dawn, until dawn I wasn't yet alone
Until dawn, until dawn the clear moon kept bringing us together
Until dawn, until dawn the clear moon kept bringing us together
Until dawn, until dawn I wasn't yet alone

I wasn't the one to blame for not being on my own
I wаѕn't on my own
