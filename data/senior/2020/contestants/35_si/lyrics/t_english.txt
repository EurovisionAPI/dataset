Water

Let's keep marching
Into a new time
Let's get out of here
Far away
Let's not rest
Anywhere
It will be a long night

You can hear the ticking of my mind
This restlessness
All that noise
Let them say what they want
As a nomad, you know well
That the longest path is the one that leads from words to action

Water
Throughout the storm, I lie in you until the end
Water is springing
But it can't reach the two of us
But it can't reach the two of us

Let's change
The bearing
Away from the lights
Convictions
There is a broken chair
Standing there
Waiting for someone
Waiting for a child

Water
Throughout the storm, I lie in you until the end
Water is springing
But it can't reach the two of us
But it can't reаch the two of uѕ
