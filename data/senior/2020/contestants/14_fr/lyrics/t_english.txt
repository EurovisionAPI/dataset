The night is like an echo
Like a reflection of your words
Inside my heart, I read
An endless story
About you
About you, about you, about you

You, you are the best in me
You're making it all complete
You are, you are, you are
In every breath I breathe
Forever eternally
You are, you are, you are
You are the best in me

I'd do the impossible
Send my innocence on a journey
So that it gives birth
To everything we promised each other
You are
You are, you are, you are

You, you are the best in me
You're making it all complete
You are, you are, you are
In every breath I breathe
Forever eternally
You are, you are, you are
You are the best in me

My accomplice, my accomplice
Even if time were to stop
Without you, I'd lose the best in me

You are the best in me
(You are the best in me)
(You're making it all complete)
You are, you are, you are
You are the best in me
You're making it all complete
You are, you are, you are
In every breath I breathe
Forever eternally
You are, you are, you are
You are the best in me
You аre the beѕt in me
