Make Noise

Do you know what I think?
That I shouldn't be thinking
That if I then think, I'm an animal
And if I think about you, you're a soul
But maybe it's this storm
That takes me to you
And I know I shouldn't find myself
Without an umbrella, even though

I understood that
However much I run away
I always return to you
Who makes noise here
And I don't know if it's good for me
If your noise fits me
But make noise, yes
Because I can't stand
This unnatural silence
Between you and me

And I go around without speaking
Without a destination to arrive to
I'm wearing down my shoes
And perhaps my shoes
Know all too well where to go
That I find myself in the same places again
Exactly those places that I should have avoided
And I pretend I don't remember
And I pretend to forget

But I understand that
However much I run away
I always return to you
Who makes noise here
And I don't know if it's good for me
If your noise fits me
But make noise, yes
Because I can't stand
This unnatural silence
Between you and me

But make noise, yes
Because I can't stand
This unnatural silence
And now I don't want to do without
This beautiful noiѕe you mаke
