Chains On You

I got it, you wanna take me to the party
'Cause you're naughty, huh
Well let me tell you a kind of story

Yeah, I start it, I make it, I ride it, I work it
Don't like it, I'm gonna say no
I ain't no lying, I'm trying, I'm flying, no buying
And I know I'm gonna make it to the top

Keeping my diamonds on you
I'm keeping my diamonds on you
Keeping my diamonds on you
I got angels by my side
And this is what I say to you

Diamonds shining on me
My diamonds shining on me
Diamonds shining on me
You said I don't really care
Can't you see I'm right here

Boy, don't deny my lips on fire
They're screaming boy
Let me breathe, you're all I need
And I say boy
Call my name, we're burning flame
I want you boy
I'm yours, only yours and of course
Hurt me

Chains on chains on you
Imma put them boy
Chains on chains on you
Chains on chains on you
Imma put them boy
Chains on chains on you

I was staring at you while sitting next to you, I think I got a juice
I started thinking how my name would sound to you
So, you were walking towards me
And I knew I should believe
I would be the one that'll really make you feel like a boss

I start it, I make it, I ride it, I work it
Don't like it, I'm gonna say no
I ain't no lying, I'm trying, I'm flying, no buying
And I know I'm gonna make it to the top

Keeping my diamonds on you
I'm keeping my diamonds on you
Keeping my diamonds on you
I got angels by my side
And this is what I say to you

Diamonds shining on me
My diamonds shining on me
Diamonds shining on me
You said I don't really care
Can't you see I'm right here

Boy, don't deny my lips on fire
They're screaming boy
Let me breathe, you're all I need
And I say boy
Call my name, we're burning flame
I want you boy
I'm yours, only yours and of course
Hurt me

Hurt me

I'm yours, only yours and of course
Hurt me

Chains on chains on you
Imma put them boy
Chains on chains on you
Chains on chains on you
Imma put them boy
Chains on chains on you

Diamonds shining on me
My diamonds shining on me
Diamonds shining on me
You said I don't really care
Cаn't you ѕee I'm right here
