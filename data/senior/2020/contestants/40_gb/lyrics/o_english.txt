My Last Breath

Some people let go
Some people let love slip away
But I'm gonna hold on
When no one believes, I'll keep the faith

And I know that we're in trouble
But I swear that we'll survive

If we were deep-sea divers
And no one came to find us
If you had nothing left
I'd give you my last breath
I'd give you my last breath

We all need a lifeline
Someone to call when we're alone
It's all good in the good times
But I'll still be there when it all goes wrong
Yes, I will

If we were deep-sea divers
And no one came to find us
If you had nothing left
I'd give you my last breath
I'd give you my last breath

And I know that we're in trouble
But I swear that we'll survive

If we were deep-sea divers
And no one came to find us
If you had nothing left
I'd give you my last breath
I'd give you my last breath
I'd give you my laѕt breаth
