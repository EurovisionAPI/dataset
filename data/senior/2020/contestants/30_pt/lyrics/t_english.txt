Fear to Feel

What's the way out
I think I don't know how to love anymore
And if love invites me
I can't accept it now
Seems like it's routine
My loneliness insists in returning

I wasn't like this
But now I have fear to feel
Ask the time, it knows everything about me
Ask the time, it knows everything about me

If you give me your hand
I don't know how I'll react
If you speak from the heart
It feels like I'm listening again
To one more illusion
That doesn't take too long to leave

I wasn't like this
But now I have fear to feel
Ask the time, it knows everything about me
Ask the time, it knows everything about me
What it keeps away, says everything that I feel for you

I already tried to change
But life took away
The best that I had in me
And if I was to return some day
Will you wait for me?

I wasn't like this
But now I have fear to feel
Ask the time, it knows everything about me
Ask the time, it knows everything about me
What it keeps away, sayѕ everything thаt I feel for you
