Empires

Ashes to ashes, dust into dust
I'll follow you through black
Try to forgive that I'm not awake
I'm dreaming this dream could last

No looking down
There's fool's gold in our eyes

Burning an empire
Happens so easy
Playing with fire
Maybe it's you and me
Burning an empire
Is it our fault?
We rise and fall

Like moths to a flame
Like a bird to a pane of glass
Hoping for change but we do the same
We're gasoline and a match

No looking down
There's fool's gold in our eyes

Burning an empire
Happens so easy
Playing with fire
Maybe it's you and me
Burning an empire
Is it our fault?
We rise and fall

We just want it all
Used to be a tower so tall
Now we are only crumbling walls

We rise and fall
Moth to a flame as we do the same
Like a bird to a pane of glass

Down to the wire
Empireѕ fаll
