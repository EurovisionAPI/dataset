Still Breathing

I will keep on going
I will keep on running
Running till I reach the end
Strong enough to take it
I am gonna make it
Destiny is in my hands

Thought I'd never get up
Thought I'm gonna give up
Lost in my way
Many time between

But I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
Nothing to regret
Never looking back

I will keep on going
I will keep on running
Running till I reach the end
Strong enough to take it
I am gonna make it
Destiny is in my hands

Life, life's go on (Let the life go on)
I grow strong (So can I get strong)
Life, life's go on (Let the life go on)
But I grow strong

Every day I wake up
Trying to get higher
Be a better woman
Working even harder

I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
Listening to my heart
Ready for the start

I will keep on going
I will keep on running
Running till I reach the end
Strong enough to take it
I am gonna make it
Destiny is in my hands

Life, life's go on (Let the life go on)
I grow strong (So can I get strong)
Life, life's go on (Let the life go on)
But I grow strong

Reaching for the stars
I'm knowing getting closer
Life is music
I am a composer
My dreams become so real with
All the love I'm feeling

I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing

I will keep on going
I will keep on running
Running till I reach the end
I will keep on going
I will keep on running
Running till I reach the end
Life, life

I will keep on going
I will keep on running
Running till I reach the end
Strong enough to take it
I am gonna make it
Destiny is in my hаndѕ
