Universe

Forgive me, forgive me
Uni-universe
Forgive me, forgive me

Everything that I'm hiding when I'm scared
Becomes reality in this silence
I can be like the wind
And disappear

Forgive me, forgive me
Uni-universe
Forgive me, forgive me
Uni-universe
For shutting down my voice
To avoid being the culprit
Of what I am
Forgive me
Uni-universe
Uni-universe

I had to listen to myself when there was time, I don't understand
How I lost myself in one single moment
Tell me where the dreams I have left will go
If there's no space left in my head

Forgive me, forgive me
Uni-universe
Forgive me, forgive me
Uni-universe
For shutting down my voice
To avoid being the culprit
Of what I am
Forgive me
Uni-universe
Uni-universe
Uni-universe
Uni-universe

I can be like the wind
And disappear
I can run out
And disappear

Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me…
(Uni-universe)
(Forgive me, forgive me)
(Uni-universe)
For shutting down my voice
To avoid being the culprit
Of what I аm
Forgive me, forgive me
