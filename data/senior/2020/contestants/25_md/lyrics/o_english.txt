Prison

I don't want to feel you
I don't want to feel you this close
I don't want to hold you
Do I want to hold or let go
I don't want to fight the night
Inside with you

I am surrounded by walls
Covered with all your memories
Wish this were solitary no
Walking with me in the halls
So, there is no forgetting
I know you 'll never let me

I don't want to be with you
I don't want to be without you
I don't want to be with you
I don't want to be without you

Prison
I can't escape from this
Prison
Love is a fool's prison

I don't want to need you
I don't want to seem so desperate
I don't want tell you
I don't want to hear it's useless
I don't want to fight the night
Inside with you

I am surrounded by walls
Covered with all your memories
Wish this were solitary

I don't want to be with you
I don't want to be without you
I don't want to be with you
I don't want to be without you

Prison
I can't escape from this
Prison
Love is a fool's prison

Prison
I can't escape from this
Prison
Love is а fool's priѕon
