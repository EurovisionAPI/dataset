Violent Thing

Got that thing that I can't deny
Killing me soft with the big brown eyes
Such a violent thing, would you let me know
Knocking me down like a domino

You know that I'm right here, I'm working on love
I'm waiting on something I need
I think that you, you know
You know what I want
You got me on the edge of my seat

Oh, don't tell your mama what you're doing tonight
Twenty-four hours ago you got that look in your eyes
Don't need your number, 'cause I know you'll be there
Happen all night and the beat don't lie, we're crystal clear
'Cause if I got you with me tonight
Feeling like I'm feeling tonight
Don't tell your mama
Oh, you're such a violent thing
Oh, you're such a violent thing

Shooting high, we're getting low
Guns and roses all alone
And I wanna hear what you gotta say
But you won't give me no audio

You know that I'm right here, I'm working on love
I'm waiting on something I need
I think that you, you know
You know what I want
You got me on the edge of my seat

Oh, don't tell your mama what you're doing tonight
Twenty-four hours ago you got that look in your eyes
Don't need your number, 'cause I know you'll be there
Happen all night and the beat don't lie, we're crystal clear
'Cause if I got you with me tonight
Feeling like I'm feeling tonight
Don't tell your mama
Oh, you're such a violent thing
Oh…

You know that I'm right here, I'm working on love
I'm waiting on something I need
I think that you, you know
You know what I want
You got me on the edge of my seat

Oh, don't tell your mama what you're doing tonight
Twenty-four hours ago you got that look in your eyes
Don't need your number, 'cause I know you be there
Happen all night and the beat don't lie, we're crystal clear
'Cause if I got you with me tonight
Feeling like I'm feeling tonight
Don't tell your mama
Oh, you're such a violent thing
Oh, you're such a violent thing

Don't tell your mama
Oh, you're ѕuch а violent thing
