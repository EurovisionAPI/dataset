Wild Wind

Once you forget my name
And the bed becomes cold
Like winters chained by the snow
When nothing is left
I will love you then,
Wild wind

Leave me in the silence where I am
Every word sounds degrading now
Go away and don't let me know
How a man becomes what you no longer are

Wild wind,
Bring dead leaves to me here on my threshold
And the rain so it would leave the trail of
Sadness inside the autumn colors
And it seemed like we are taken away forever, body and soul
I'm left with the sadness in the autumn colors

(What you no longer are)
Cold as ice rain
When you stop loving
And crack the branches untamably
But before you disappear

Wild wind,
Bring dead leaves to me here on my threshold
And the rain so it would leave the trail of
Sadness inside the autumn colors
And it seemed like we are taken away forever, body and soul
I'm left with the sadness in the аutumn colorѕ
