Visionary dream

I'll dream up tales and rhymes
In visionary dream
This precious moment of my life
Holds me excited

I will fly away
To reach the heights I've ever dreamed
Beneath the sun
No sense of time and space

And dissipation of your light
Holds me excited

Clouds containing lakes
And in the haze of morning light
I feel embraced

Sailing through my story
Sharing my history
Sailing through my story
Sharing my history

Ha… haha hahaha…

Sailing through my story
Sharing my history
Sailing through my story
Sharing my history

The precious moment of my life
Holds me excited
The meditation of my dreams
Holds me delighted

I will fly away
To reach the ambience I've dreamed
Beneath the sun

Sailing through my story
Sharing my history
Sailing through my story
