Let's save the world

I can't understand why the world is upside down
And we don't want to find solutions to the problems
Don't want to be what you are not

You're always thinking whether your life is good
And there's no time for the rest
The world is in danger and you don't do anything

We all agree we can do it
We can unite, do it well
Think by yourself, by yourself
(One, two, one, two, one, two, three, four) 

Left, right, up and down, turned upside down 
That's how we treat the world right now 
Can't hide the fact that it's happening 

We can do our world some good 
We can make a change, that's what we should 
Time will tell us, but we must act now 

The problem seems to be
That the interests are not the same
Fixing the world now
It's possible (if we all do it)

We all agree we can do it
We can unite, do it well
Think by yourself, by yourself
(One, two, one, two, one, two, three, four) 

Left, right, up and down, turned upside down 
That's how we treat the world right now 
Can't hide the fact that it's happening 

Left, right, up and down, turned upside down 
That's how we treat the world right now 
Can't hide the fact that it's happening 

We can do our world some good 
We can make a change, that's what we should 
Time will tell us, but we must act now 

Left, right, up and down, turned upside down 
That's how we make the world turn now 
Can't hide the fact that it's happening 

We can do our world some good 
We can make a change, that's what we should 
Time will tell us, but we must act now 

If you want, you can do it, we can change it
Transform reality
We still can act, but we don't react 
'Cauѕe we only care about what we have 
About what we hаve 
(One, two, one, two, one, two, three, four)
