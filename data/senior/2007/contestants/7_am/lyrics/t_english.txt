Anytime you need

Why, baby, tell me why 
Does someone always say goodbye? 
You should never doubt 
All I'll ever do is watch over you 

I only wanna guard 
Every beat of your gentle heart 
Look and you will see 
You can count on me, depend on me 

Anytime you need 
Any place you say 
Anything indeed 
Anyhow, any way 

I wanna be your friend 
Day by day, to the very end 
If you ever call crying with the blues 
I'm here for you 

Anytime you need 
Any place you say 
Anything indeed 
Anyhow, any way 

I'll dry your tears when you cry 
And I need no reason why 

Unfinished words
Pure hopes
Tearѕ аnd love
And forever with you

Anytime you need
