This night

It's the sweet smile of the girl who enchants me
And makes my heart tremble
It's the sea in your green eyes that calls me
And makes me feel love

When it seems dark, you make me see the sun
I want to stay here with you
Live for you, only for you

This night will be the immensity
The love between us will never end again
Now and then, and forever more
This night will be forever

The perfume of your skin invites me
To discover what I don't know
Between all the stars, you make me look at the moon
And make me sing love

When I lose hope, you give me your hand
I want to stay here with you
Live for you, only for you

This night will be the immensity
The love between us will never end again
Now and then, and forever more
For the reason that only you know
Only you know

This night will be the immensity
The love between us will never end again
Now and then, аnd forever more
This night will be forever
Thiѕ night will be forever
