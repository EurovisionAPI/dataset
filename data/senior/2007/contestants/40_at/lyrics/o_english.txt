Get A Life - Get Alive

Livin' in this world – be a little too much
Don't let it get you down, get up and strut
Ooh…
If you ever get the chance, hold your hand out and take it
Make a promise to yourself, don't you break it

Oh, I tried to get up when I was upside down
Got to find a way to turn my life around

This is the time for us to get a life
Open your mind to a better life
There's no way of knowin' where you're goin'
Get a life, a better life

Go outta your way and make some compromise
Hold to your dreams and you will realise
If you don't understand it, don't take it for granted
Open your mind to a better life

Let's turn up the heat, start a ripple in the water
Wake the soul from its sleep, no particular order
Could be wastin' precious time, free the mind, are you willin'?
Don't be afraid, do your dance and start livin'

I've got a vision in mind, I'm doin' my time
I'm livin' my life 'cause I've opened my mind

This is the time for us to get a life
Open your mind to a better life
There's no way of knowin' where you're goin'
Get a life, a better life

Go outta your way and make some compromise
Hold to your dreams and you will realise
If you don't understand it, don't take it for granted

There's no way of knowin' where you're goin'
This is the time for us to get a life

This is the time for us to get a life
Open your mind to a better life
There's no way of knowin' where you're goin'
Get a life, a better life

Go outta your way and make some compromise
Hold to your dreams and you will realise
If you don't understand it, don't take it for granted

This is the time to get a life
(This is the time) to get a life
(This is the time)
