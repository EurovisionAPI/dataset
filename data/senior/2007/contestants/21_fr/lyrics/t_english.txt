Love the French way

I remember  beautiful girl
The last summer,  us, the Eiffel Tower
I remember  how beautiful you were
So beautiful with your  Chanel handbag

On the bridge of the Seine
Let's do it again, again, again, again 
You gave me a  rendezvous
What is it, what is it? 

I am looking for you in the streets
I didn't come because you aren't there anymore
I'm looking everywhere, where are you? 
My heart is bleeding, oh, I miss you 

Love the French way
Let's do it again, again, again, again 
You gave me a  rendezvous

And I run, I run, I run
I've lost  love, love, love
I'm lost, here without you 
And I'm crazy,  alone in Paris
I miss you, without you I can't 
And under the rain, I feel sorry 
Champs-Élysées, alone  at night
The Moulin Rouge, I feel guilty 

And the sun is burning stronger than the birds
And in the sky, I miss you so 
A souvenir, a  rendezvous
Flowers, flowers, flowers for you 
I miss you, without you I can't 
And under the rain, I feel sorry 
I'm lost, here without you 
And I'm crazy,  alone in Paris

I remember  beautiful girl
The last summer,  how beautiful you were
I remember  us, the Eiffel Tower
So beautiful with your  Chanel handbag

Love the French way
It's that I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I give you a  rendezvous

And I run, I run, I run
I've lost  love, love, love
I'm lost, here without you 
And I'm crazy,  alone in Paris
I miss you, without you I can't 
And under the rain, I feel sorry 
Champs-Élysées, alone  at night
The Moulin Rouge, I feel guilty 

And the sun is burning stronger than the birds
And in the sky, I miss you so 
A souvenir, a  rendezvous
Flowers, flowers, flowers for you 
I miss you, without you I can't 
Under the rаin, I feel sorry 
I'm loѕt, here without…
