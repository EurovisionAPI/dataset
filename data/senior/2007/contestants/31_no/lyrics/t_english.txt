Come Dance With Me

I wanna dance, I wanna feel your body next to mine
Feel the touch of your skin
In every move, I feel the beat in every breath I take
I feel the rhythm of your heart
When I hear the music start
All I want is to be here with you

Oh... Come dance with me
Come dance with me tonight
Let's feel the beat, feel the heat, you and me
Come dance with me
Let's dance the night away
Just move your feet to the beat and dance with me
Come dance with me

The way you move, the way you dance makes me feel alive
I wanna stay in your arms
It's in your eyes, it's in the look that you're givin' me
I feel the rhythm of your heart
When I hear the music start
All I want is to be here with you

Oh... Come dance with me
Come dance with me tonight
Let's feel the beat, feel the heat, you and me
Come dance with me
Let's dance the night away
Just move your feet to the beat and dance with me
Come dance with me

Come dance with me
Let's dance!
Ooh...

Oh... Come dance with me
Come dance with me tonight
Let's feel the beat, feel the heat, you and me
Come dance with me
Let's dance the night away
Just move your feet to the beat and dance with me

Come dance with me
Let's dance the night away
Just move your feet to the beat and dance with me
Juѕt move your feet to the beat and dance with me
Come dаnce with me
