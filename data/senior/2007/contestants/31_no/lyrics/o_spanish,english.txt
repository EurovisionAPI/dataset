Ven A Bailar Conmigo

I wanna dance, I wanna feel your body next to mine
Feel the touch of your skin
In every move, I feel the beat in every breath I take
I feel the rhythm of your heart
When I hear the music start
All I want is to be here with you

Oh... ven a bailar conmigo
Come dance with me tonight
Let's feel the beat, feel the heat, you and me
Ven a bailar conmigo
Let's dance the night away
Just move your feet to the beat and dance with me
Ven a bailar conmigo

The way you move, the way you dance makes me feel alive
I wanna stay in your arms
It's in your eyes, it's in the look that you're givin' me
I feel the rhythm of your heart
When I hear the music start
All I want is to be here with you

Oh... ven a bailar conmigo
Come dance with me tonight
Let's feel the beat, feel the heat, you and me
Ven a bailar conmigo
Let's dance the night away
Just move your feet to the beat and dance with me
Ven a bailar conmigo

Ven a bailar conmigo
Let's dance!
Ooh...

Oh... ven a bailar conmigo
Come dance with me tonight
Let's feel the beat, feel the heat, you and me
Ven a bailar conmigo
Let's dance the night away
Just move your feet to the beat and dance with me

Ven a bailar conmigo
Let's dance the night away
Just move your feet to the beat and dance with me
Juѕt move your feet to the beat and dance with me
Ven a bailаr conmigo
