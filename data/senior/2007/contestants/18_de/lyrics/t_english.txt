Women rule the world

Even back at school, the boys all laughed
But I really didn't care
She was so cute, her legs were so long
I went to her ballet class for almost a year

When I found out she was into the environment
I stitched "no, thanks" onto my parka
She didn't care about that back then
But since then, I know who rules the world

The way they walk and stand
The way they look at you
And your wallet and heart start to open up
And you buy a ring and a mink coat

One seductive glance
And your political views start to change
It's not the boss or the action heroes
It's not the state or mafia money
Women rule the world

All the stops, from coquettish to naive
Even as babies, they had a hold on their fathers
They give everything when there's something they want
And you bang your head against a brick wall when they're sulking

You make a fool of yourself and let yourself get beaten up
Just so the girls would look over just once
They can push Beckham and overthrow Clinton
Without even having to form a party

The way they walk and stand
The way they look at you
And your wallet and heart start to open up
And you buy a ring and a mink coat

One seductive glance
And your political views start to change
It's not the boss or the action heroes
It's not the state or mafia money
Women rule the world

Come on guys 

How they look and smile 
How they talk and while 
They are making us think that we're kings 
Guess who is really pulling the strings 

Just a glance, one move 
Turns a no into "I approve" 
And while your head's in a whirl 
And you're cаlling her your little girl 
Guess who rules the world 

Guess who ruleѕ the world
