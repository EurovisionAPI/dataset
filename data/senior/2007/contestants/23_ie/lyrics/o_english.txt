They Can't Stop The Spring

The curtain has been raised, the wall no longer stands
And from Lisadell to Latvia, we're singing as one clan
The curtain has been raised, and Europe's all one stage
And the archipelagic icicles have melted like the cage

We don't need no party, just a party band
A continental choir singing hand in hand

They might scare the blackbird
But they cannot stop him sing
They may steal the honey
But they'll never steal the sting
They may crush the flowers
Trample every living thing
But they can't stop the spring

They might scare the blackbird
But they cannot stop him sing
They may steal the honey
But they'll never steal the sting
They may crush the flowers
And trample every living thing
But they can't stop the spring

They might scare the blackbird
But they cannot stop him sing
They may steal the honey
But they'll never steal the sting
They may crush the flowers
And trample every living thing
But they can't stop the spring

No, they cаn't stop the ѕpring
