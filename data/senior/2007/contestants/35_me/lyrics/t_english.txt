Come on, step up

Come on, step up, step up and jump
You got caught in my eye

Who do you belong to, beautiful girl?
I'll kiss your dark eye
Who do you belong to, beautiful girl?
I'll kiss your dark eye

Oh, how beautiful you are, like all the seas
Oh, when the dawn awakens from your eye
My love

Come on, step up, step up and jump
You got caught in my eye
Come on, step up, step up and jump
Even if there were seven others, I wouldn't give you to anyone

Kiss me, beautiful girl
So I could fly like a grey falcon
Kiss me, beautiful girl
I'll fly like a grey falcon

Oh, how beautiful you are, like all the seas
Oh, when the dawn awakes from your eye
My love

Come on, step up, step up and jump
You got caught in my eye
Come on, step up, step up and jump
Even if there were seven others, I wouldn't give you to anyone

Come on, step up (Step up and jump)
You got (caught in my eye)

Come on, step up, step up and jump
You got caught in my eye
Come on, step up, step up and jump
Even if there were seven otherѕ, I wouldn't give you to аnyone
