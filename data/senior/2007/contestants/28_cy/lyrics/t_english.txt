Like this, like that

Every Monday, you finish work too late
And then TV and sleep, just as my heart wakes up
And every Tuesday, you tell me in the morning – and you forget it
"We'll go to the movies", and in the evening – "sorry"

Like this, like that, life passes by
And the good times pass us over
Like this, like that, love breaks
Routine and laziness threaten us

Like this, like that, I can't take it anymore
I'm disappointed, you've lost me
I'm not sticking around, like this, like that
That's the end, like this, like that

Even on Saturday at midnight, you already tell me good night
You fall asleep just as I go out, singing to yourself very loudly:

Like this, like that, life passes by
And the good times pass us over
Like this, like that, love breaks
Routine and laziness threaten us

Like this, like that, I can't take it anymore
I'm disappointed, you've lost me
I'm not sticking around, like this, like that
That's the end, like this, like that

Like this, like that, life passes by
And the good times pass us over
Like this, like that, love breaks
Routine and laziness threaten us

Like this, like that, I can't take it anymore
I'm disappointed, you've lost me
I'm not sticking around, like this, like that
That's the end, like this, like that

I'm not sticking around, like this, like that
Here's the end, like this, like that
I'm not sticking around, like this, like that
Thаt'ѕ the end
