Flower of the south

Take, take this flower in your hand
Don't ask how I'll manage without you
Put it on your heart
Let it remind you of me

My white flower
My faraway world
Come, return, be mine again
Everything of me is forever yours in this lifetime
Flower of the south, still close to the sea
I'm waiting for you
I'm still waiting for you

(My white flower)

I love something that is not there anymore
You're just my vision from times past

My white flower (My white flower, my white flower)
My faraway world (My white flower, my white flower)
Come, return, be mine again
Everything of me is forever yours in this lifetime
Flower of the south, still close to the sea
I'm waiting for you

(My white flower)
(My faraway world)
(Come, return, be mine again)
Everything of me is forever yours in this lifetime
Flower of the south, still close to the sea
I'm waiting for you
I'm ѕtill wаiting for you
