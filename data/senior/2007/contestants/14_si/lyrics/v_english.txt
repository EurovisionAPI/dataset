Flower of the South

Take this flower, take it now
Please don't ask me how will I live
Put it, put it close to your heart
And when we're apart, I'l still feel

White flower of mine, cold world of yours
How long apart, how long, who knows?
Bring him back to me, too long he's captured in my dream
My precious flower of the south, I'm by the sea, waiting for him

(White flower of mine)

Put it, put it close to your heart
And when we're apart, I'll still feel

White flower of mine (How long apart)
Cold world of yours (How long apart)
How long apart, how long, who knows?
Bring him back to me, too long he's captured in my dream
My precious flower of the south, I'm by the sea

(White flower of mine, cold world of yours)
(How long apart, how long, who knows?)
Bring him back to me, too long he's captured in my dream
My precious flower of the south, I'm by the ѕea, wаiting for him
