Yassou Maria

First off, she's a lady, this is a lady's world
Man, she drives 'em crazy, dancin' like a cheeky girl
All eyes on Maria, no lie, she's the bomb
Oh my, they all wanna see her
All wanna be the lucky one

Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh… yassou Maria
Turn around, bring it down, go slow
Heads up, Lord have mercy

Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh… yassou Maria
Ai ai ai… there she goes
Maria

Yassou Maria

Moves like Aphrodite, so high above the rest
Smooth like Cleopatra, an angel in a devil's dress
Her hips, lust in motion, her lips, red like wine
She is the heart of attention
Probably should mention – she's mine

Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh… yassou Maria
Turn around, bring it down, go slow
Heads up, Lord have mercy

Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh… yassou Maria
Ai ai ai… there she goes
Maria

Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh… yassou Maria
Turn around, bring it down, go slow
Heads up, Lord have mercy

Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh… yassou Maria
Ai ai ai… there she goes
Maria

Maria, Maria, yasѕou Maria
Maria, Mariа
