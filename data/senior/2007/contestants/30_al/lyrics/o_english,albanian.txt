Hear My Plea

I say farewell, the final call
I turn and walk away, I leave it all
I find that life regains its glow
But the journey's long, the going's slow

A million miles later
I crave a love that's greater
Take me home again, ah…

Kthema Zot
Kthema mallin që më more
Kur më nise larg, ah…

Kthema Zot
Vetëm loti thyen gurin
Që e hodha pas

Të lutem kthema Zot
Ti kthema lotin që më more
Kur më nise larg

Ah…
Ah…

Hear my plea
Take the longing of my heartbeat
Make the melody

Hear my plea
As it quivers in the tear drops
That you shed for me

I beg you, hear my plea
Take the longing of my heartbeat
For eternity

I beg you, hear my plea
The pain, the suffering of todаy
Tomorrow'ѕ memory
Ah…
