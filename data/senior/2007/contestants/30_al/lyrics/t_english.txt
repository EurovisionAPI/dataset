Hear My Plea

I say farewell, the final call 
I turn and walk away, I leave it all 
I find that life regains its glow 
But the journey's long, the going's slow 

A million miles later 
I crave a love that's greater 
Take me home again, ah… 

Bring me God
Bring me the nostalgia that you took from me
When you sent me away, ah…

Bring me God
Only the tears can break the rock
That I left behind

Please bring me God
Bring me the tears that you took from me
When you sent me away

Ah… 
Ah… 

Hear my plea 
Take the longing of my heartbeat 
Make the melody 

Hear my plea 
As it quivers in the tear drops 
That you shed for me 

I beg you, hear my plea 
Take the longing of my heartbeat 
For eternity 

I beg you, hear my plea 
The pain, the suffering of todаy 
Tomorrow'ѕ memory 
Ah…
