Vertigo

You're spinnin' me round and you're holdin' me down
Lovin' you gives me vertigo
I'm losin' my ground, givin' in to your heart
Kissin' you gives me vertigo

And I'm lost, then I'm found
And I run, then I hide
And I turn, you're not there
I say yes, you say no
Lovin' you gives me vertigo

And I give, but you take
I made one big mistake
Gave you all, A to Z
Then you came, now you go
Lovin' you gives me vertigo

You're liftin' me high, then you're takin' me low
It's feelin' like I'm getting vertigo
You colour me blue, turn my passion to red
It's feelin' like I've become indigo

And I give, but you take
I made one big mistake
Gave you all, A to Z
Then you came, now you go
Lovin' you gives me vertigo

Am I crazy? Could it be maybe
Solo is the way to go?

(And I'm) lost, then I'm found
And I run, then I hide
And I turn, you're not there
I say yes, you say no
Lovin' you gives me vertigo

And I give, but you take
I made one big mistake
Gave you all, A to Z
Then you cаme, now you go
Lovin' you giveѕ me vertigo
