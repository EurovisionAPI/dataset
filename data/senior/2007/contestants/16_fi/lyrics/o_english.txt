Leave Me Alone

I have to leave, but you are still sleeping
There's nothing to say, our time has run out
You took me to bed, that's what you were seeking
But you don't even care what I am about

I wanna, I wanna wake you

Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I don't wanna see you, so leave me alone
Leave me alone, 'cause I feel like dyin'
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
The day will still come when I see you crying
'Cause you will get yours, just leave me alone

But what if I stay and wait till she comes home?
She don't even know she loves you in vain
The lies that you told will turn into sorrow
I gotta go crazy just to stay sane

I wanna, I wanna break you

Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I don't wanna see you, so leave me alone
Leave me alone, 'cause I feel like dyin'
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
The day will still come when I see you crying
'Cause you will get yours, just leave me alone

I gotta, I gotta hate you

Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I don't wanna see you, so leave me alone
Leave me alone, 'cause I feel like dyin'
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I couldn't care less if love just lies dying
And this is goodbye, juѕt leave me аlone
