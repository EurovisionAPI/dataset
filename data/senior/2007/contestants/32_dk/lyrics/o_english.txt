Drama queen

When the sun is setting at the end of the day
And the city fills with shades of grey
In between the streetlight and the moonlit snow
There's a place I go
Where I do my show

I'm your drama queen tonight
All my troubles are out of sight
When the lights are on
I will be your shining star
I'm your drama queen tonight
Everything's gonna be alright
When I get on the stage tonight

It's a space in time where every dream comes true
And tomorrow's sorrows just won't do
In between reality and fantasy
I will make you see
If you just believe

I'm your drama queen tonight
All my troubles are out of sight
When the lights are on
I will be your shining star
I'm your drama queen tonight
Everything's gonna be alright
When I get on the stage tonight

No more use pretending
No more reason to run and hide
Let's make all our dreams come true tonight

I'm you drama queen tonight
All my troubles are out of sight
When the lights are far
I will be your shining star
I'm your drama queen tonight
Everything's gonna be alright
When I get on the stage tonight
Oh… 'cauѕe I'm your dramа queen tonight
