Unsubstantial blues

How many times have you fooled me and denied that
It's her who you love, and it sure isn't me?
So now that it's over, I'll try and take it sober
Leave questions unasked, remember us laughing at the broken past
God, if I could make it on without you

You're such a casual man, oh, wavin' an empty hand
I'm helpless and I'm lonely without you
Yes, you're a casual man, lendin' an empty hand
Left me breathless with nothing more to lose

I used to dream we'd take it nice and easy
Get jobs, settle down in Jameson Town
If now you could see me, you'd think twice about leaving
You said forever is the time you gonna spend around

So why did you leave me?
And why should I believe it?
You say goodbye
Oh, why, oh… why you leave me?
Said, why?

You're such a casual man, oh, wavin' an empty hand
I'm helpless and I'm lonely without you
You're such a casual man, lendin' an empty hand
Left me breathless with nothing more to lose

Casual man, lendin' an empty hand
Left me breathless with nothing more to lose
Except an evanescent unsubstantiаl blueѕ
