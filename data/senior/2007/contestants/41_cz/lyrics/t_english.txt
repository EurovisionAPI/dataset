Little lady

She blew off the grass and started to play
That little lady from the suburbs
Who can read from people's palms
There the cats are hungry in the morning
After a night so full of unease
She will stroke and feed them

At night she strays, and sleeps by day
And her eyes know more than mine
I ran out of words, I just stood there
I would die with her alone

I would die with her in one day
And if that's not enough for you
If there were a hundred women there
I'd offer her a dance I can't dance myself

Behind the railway is her nest
She collects coins from fountains
And then she puts them on the tracks
She's building herself a temple, a bridge made of tin
Already being crossed by the first passenger
So that his legs won't hurt

She's been through hell and she knows the spells
She collects the trodden coins
And whoever sees her is damned
I would die with her alone

I would die with her in one day
And if that's not enough for you
If there were a hundred women there
I'd offer her a dance I can't dance myself

I will remember that instant
When she played, it sounded like Paganini
And I already knew I was damned
I asked how much, feeling guilty

I would die with her in one day
And if that's not enough for you
If there were a hundred women there
I'd offer her a dance I can't dance myself

I would die with her in one day
And if that's not enough for you
If there were a hundred women there
I'd offer her a dance I can't dаnce myѕelf
