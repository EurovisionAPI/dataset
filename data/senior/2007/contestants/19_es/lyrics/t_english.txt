I love you my darling

(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)

Come to me, discover love
Come to me, feel my passion
You, come to me like the scorpion
That sweetens with its wound

There are kisses from me that nobody's stolen
There are verses in me that nobody's heard
You, come to me like the heart
That would get stuck in me

Don't ever look back
Dare to give your heart

I love you,  my darling (Hee-eh-oh)
Tear my life and break it in two
Let my days break down if everything is a lie
And I lose your love, the power of love 

I love you,  my darling (Hee-eh-oh)
Seduce my life, feel the passion
Come, give me your days and dance to my sound
Come give your love, come give me your love 

(Hey, hey, hey)

Come to me without fear of pain
Feel for me the same way I do
You, come to me like the scorpion
That kills with its wound

Don't ever look back
Dare to give your heart

I love you,  my darling (Hee-eh-oh)
Tear my life and break it in two
Let my days break down if everything is a lie
And I lose your love, the power of love 

I love you,  my darling (Hee-eh-oh)
Seduce my life, feel the passion
Come, give me your days and dance to my sound
Come give your love, come give me your love 

(Hey, hey, hey)
I love you,  my darling
(Hey, hey, hey)
My dance of love

I love you,  my darling (Hee-eh-oh)
Tear my life and break it in two
Let my days break down if everything is a lie
And I lose your love, the power of love 

I love you,  my darling (Hee-eh-oh)
Seduce my life, feel the passion
Come, give me your days and dаnce to my ѕound
Come give your love, come give me your love 

(Hey)
