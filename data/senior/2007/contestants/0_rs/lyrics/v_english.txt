Destiny

It's been a long way, I try hard not to fall apart
Every night I pray and your voice is singing in my heart
I have been waiting a long time for you to take my hand
Loving and hating a desire that I don't understand

I can't breath, I can't sleep
Why can't I get through to you?
I can't think, I can't speak
What am I to do?

Destiny, I've been looking for something to guide me
Destiny, even though I tried, I can't deny you
If I let you go, I'd betray my soul
I know that this is something more
Even though nothing's spoken for
A way that you will feel the same 'bout me, destiny

Read the stars, see my scars
I feel so low when you're away
So reach out, it's not far
Listen to me, pray

Destiny, I've been looking for something to guide me
Destiny, even though I tried, I can't deny you
If I let you go, I'd betray my soul
I know that this is something more
Even though nothing's spoken for
A way that you will feel the same 'bout me
Destiny, destiny, oh, ooh

If I let you go, I'd betray my soul
I know that this is something more
Even though nothing's spoken for
A way that you will feel the same 'bout me, destiny

Fаith is within me, deѕtiny
