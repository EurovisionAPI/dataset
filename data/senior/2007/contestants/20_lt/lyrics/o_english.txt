Love Or Leave

Stars in the sky
When the shadows fall, when the sunlight dies
Empty streets are filled with the pale lamplight
We are just two lonely shades walking in the night

Words lose their sense
When I feel you near, when I touch your hands
I'm trying not to think that at break of dawn
You'll be gone and I'll be lost, numb and all alone

When the morning comes, I'm all alone
Left to live another day, in joy or sadness, on my own
When the morning comes, I'm all alone
Every time at break of dawn

Weak and unwise
I betray all fears that I should disguise
Melting in your arms, I fail to realise
Why the mornings always change the colour of your eyes

When the morning comes, I'm all alone
Every time at break of dawn

Love or leave, I'm with and without you
How come I am up to this senseless game?
How could I stop thinking about you?
Love or leave, don't play with my heart again

Love or leave, I'm with and without you
How come I am up to this senseless game?
How could I ѕtop thinking about you?
Hey… love or leave, don't play with my heart agаin
