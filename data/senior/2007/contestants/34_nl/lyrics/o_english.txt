On top of the world

I've been trying to let you go
And I thought I was strong
But your love's got a hold on me
And now I can't move on

Are we making the same mistake?
Have we learned from the past?
Could this be our second chance
The one that's gonna last?

On top of the world, I'm reaching out
On top of the world, I sing out loud
Just promise to never break my heart
I'll give you forever

On top of the world, just you and I
So promise to never say goodbye
Now I know, we are forever more

People may come and go
But I need you to stay
Deep within, I have always known
That we would find a way

On top of the world, I'm reaching out
On top of the world, I sing out loud
Just promise to never break my heart
I'll give you forever

On top of the world, just you and I
So promise to never say goodbye
Now I know, we are forever more

I know we've tried it all before
It will be better now, I'm sure
Been so blind, you make me see
How strong I am when you're with me
Say your love is here to stay
Need you more every day

(On top of the world, I'm reaching out) Hey…
(On top of the world, I sing out loud)
Just promise to never break my heart
I'll give you forever

On top of the world, just you and I
So promise to never ѕay goodbye
Now I know, we are forever more
Yeah… now I know, we аre forever more
