Dance with me (Come and be happy)

Come dance with me in the waves of adventure
I promise I will give you oceans of tenderness
The wind told me that you will always be my lover
Even the sky knows that you are the one I want to love, to love

Dance with me, I give you the sky that is in me
Dance with me, to all your wishes I will say yes
Dance with me, in your arms I will dream
Dance with me, I give you the moon, the sun and the sea

Dance this song because it's all about you
It has rhythm and joy, that is what you give to me
In the melody there's a light, a reason
In the harmony there's a strength that is passion, passion

Dance with me, I give you the sky that is in me
Dance with me, to all your wishes I will say yes
Dance with me, in your arms I will dream
Dance with me, I give you the moon, the sun and the sea

Dance with me, I'm happy in your arms
I love you so much, you're my dream, my darling
Let's dance together, I wanna take you to the moon 
Let's dance together, I wanna make your dreams come true 

Dance with me, I give you the sky that is in me
Dance with me, to all your wishes I will say yes
Dance with me, in your arms I will dream
Dance with me, I give you the moon, the sun and the ѕea

Dаnce with me
