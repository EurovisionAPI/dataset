I believe in love

No, it's not the pain of needing you
I live, and I know I don't have you
You'll never know how much I love you 
You'll never know how much I need you 

If you look into my eyes
That's where I've been hiding pain for a long time now
And that line from my song:
You are like salt on my wound

For I believe in love
Something you didn't want
And this heart can only dream of
And I won't let it wake up

For I believe in love
Something you didn't want
And this heart can only dream of
And I won't let it wake up

You'll never know how much I love you 
You'll never know how much I need you 

If you look into my heart
That's where you live eternally
For me, the world without you
Might as well not exist

For I believe in love
Just as you do
And all this heart can do is dream
And I won't let it wake up

For I believe in love
Just as you do (As you do)
And all this heart can do is dream
And I won't let it wake up

No, it's not the pain of needing you
I live, and I know I don't have you
You'll never know how much I love you 
You'll never know how much I need you 

No, it'ѕ not the pаin
