Love, love, I love you

Everywhere around the world, "I love you", it means the same 
Every day and every night, only you can touch my flame 
So take my heart, take my soul, everything of me 
Everywhere you go, my baby, even Italy 

You don't have to be special, "I love you" is always the same
You can say it any way you want, whether you're alone or with family (Fellow)
And then borders don't exist, love has no boundaries
In the city or in the countryside, it's the same in Spain (Miss)

Throughout the whole world, "I love you" is the same
Every day and every night, only you give me love (Come on!)
Here's my sun, I'm giving it to you, everything I am
If you go, I'll even look for you in Russia (Todomondo)

Somewhere, someone loves you, don't forget
Say yes, my darling, love, love me
Wherever you are, wherever you go
I'll be waiting, my darling, today and always

Miss, everywhere in the world, "I love you" is the same thing
Every day, every night, you stay my only rose
Take my heart, take my soul, my life, my dear (Go)
Call me wherever you are, even in Romania

Somewhere somebody loves you, don't forget
Say yes, my love, you know how love is
Wherever you are, for however long you stay, I will wait for you
The heart says that your home is here (Yo…)

Everywhere around the world,  "I love you" is always the same
Every day and every night, love, love me
Take my heart, take my soul, my life, my dear
The heart says that your home is here (Oh…)

Everywhere around the world,  "I love you" is always the same
Every day and every night, love, love me
Take my heart, take my soul, my life, my dear
The heart says that your home iѕ here

Well done! Come on!
Todomondo
Everybody,  long live love
Sing with me baby,  jump, jump аround! Hey
