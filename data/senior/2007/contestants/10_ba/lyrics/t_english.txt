A river without a name

Down a river without a name, like a wave
May my pain begin its journey to find you
Rose of all winds
Only I know the paths over water

Day by day and night by night
I build my pain
Like a bridge on a river, after you
Who still loves you like I do
Knows your soul, just the way I do?

Unfaithful sorrow, my pain
How do I return you?
To embrace you, like it's the first time
Cover with gold rivers of tears for you

Unfaithful sorrow, eh, if I only could
I would still go anywhere with you
May this pain bind to my soul for dying for you

Unfaithful sorrow, my pain
How do I return you?
To embrace you, like it's the first time
Cover with gold rivers of tears for you

Unfaithful sorrow, (my pain)
I would still go anywhere with you
May this pain bind to my soul for dying for you
(Unfaithful sorrow, unfаithful ѕorrow)
