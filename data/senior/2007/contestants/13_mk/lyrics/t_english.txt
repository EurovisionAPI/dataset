My world

Naina naina nanana naina…
Naina naina nanana naina…
Naina naina nanana naina…
Naina naina nanana na…

Tonight again I am talking to shadows
I have to run away from myself
Three angels look after me
I am walking on the right road

My world is called music
It has no religions or borders
My world is eight notes
One Balkan soul

My world is called music
It has no religions or borders
My world is eight notes
One Balkan soul

The sun wakes me up in my bed
A song caresses my soul
Three memories that were hurtful
I erased forever

My world is called music
It has no religions or borders
My world is eight notes
One Balkan soul

Music is the only world for me 
In my world we live in harmony 
Music knows no creed or colour 
Day by day, we'll live our dream 

Naina naina nanana naina…
Naina naina nanana naina…
Naina naina nanana naina…
Nanana naina… hey…

Music is the only world for me 
In my world we live in harmony 
Music knows no creed or colour 
Day by day, we'll live our dream 

Music knowѕ no creed or colour 
Day by day, we'll live our dreаm
