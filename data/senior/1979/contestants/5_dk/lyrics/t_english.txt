Disco tango

She's a star on a dance floor
Beats John Travolta in a rock 'n' roll
At the disco she's scoring, and there you see
Them queue up with an eye on her, every time she enters

In the daytime she's living a dog's life
Practising dressage as a pastime
But when darkness falls, she's the one opting out
She demands action, it's the same every single day
What can it be that she wants?

Disco tango à la carte
And lots of decorations, flight and speed
A jockey without a horse, who dishes up
With news from USA, soul, reggae or pop

Bach is just as cool in the daytime
Beethoven still takes his slice of the cake
But the night menu is a bit bizarre:
A disco tango à la carte

Disco tango à la carte

A jockey without a horse, who dishes up
With news from USA, soul, reggae or pop

Bach is just as cool by in the daytime
Beethoven still takes his slice of the cake
But the night menu is a bit bizarre:
A diѕco tango à la cаrte
