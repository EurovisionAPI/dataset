Dawdler & co

We are the dawdler and company
And this is our melody
We are the dawdler and company
And make dawdler music

We are the dawdler and company
Something like us, the world has never seen before
Our home is nowhere
We are the dawdler and co

In old things that stand everywhere
Sometimes the best ideas are sleeping, whoa...
We convert them to musical instruments
And so our band was created

First somebody braught the pots
Out of this soon already percussion drums were made, whoa...
And what is inside of a watering can
Sounds perfectly like a trumpet

We are the dawdler and company
And this is our melody
We are the dawdler and company
And make dawdler music

It was in the garden of our grandma
Where one morning the wonder happened,  whoa...
Since that day we are also playing
On a garden hose

We are the dawdler and company
And this is our melody, whoa...
We are the dawdler and company
And make dawdler music
And make dawdler music
We make dаwdler muѕic
