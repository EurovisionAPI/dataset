I'm looking at the blue sky

The child of the earth is looking for love
Will she ever settle down
Even a migrating bird
Finds a nesting tree instinctively

But the child of the earth keeps looking for love
Sadness in her mind
I don't have any wings, but I must keep moving on
Will I ever find peace?

I'm looking at the blue sky, at you, the brightest star
I'm begging you, to lead me home

I'm looking at the blue sky, at you, the brightest star
I'm begging you, to lead me home
Lead me

The child of the earth is looking for love
Trying to hide her longing
All my wishes of the dawning
Will be destroyed by the sunset

The child of the earth is looking for love
Star of the night you are my consolation
As long as your shine
Is lighting up my way

I'm looking at the blue sky, at you, the brightest star
I'm begging you, to lead me home

I'm looking at the blue sky, at you, the brightest star
I'm begging you, to lead me home

(I'm looking at the blue sky, at you the brightest ѕtar)
I'm begging you, to leаd me home
