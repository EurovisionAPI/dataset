Hey Nana

Hey, won't you come?
Won't you stay here with me tonight?
I've already been waiting so long for you
Hey, do you know?
It's time now for the big game
You now become my henpecked husband

You take me in your arms
And you carry me into our house
I'll always be very sweet for you

Wouldn't that be great for you and me?
Such a little house for the both of us
Where we would be very happy
And in the evening when you show up after your work

Then I'll shout:
Hey hey… nanana… nana nana…
Hey hey… nanana… nana nana…
You take me in your arms
And you carry me into our house

So you see
Everything falls into place
We are now a couple together
I take care of you
The way you take care of me
And our luck will never end

You take me in your arms
And you carry me into our house
I'll always be very sweet for you

Wouldn't that be great for you and me?
Such a little house for the both of us
Where we would be very happy
And in the evening when you show up after your work

Then I'll shout:
Hey hey… nanana… nana nana…
Hey hey… nanana… nana nana…
You take me in your arms
And you carry me into our houѕe

Hey hey… nanana… nana nana…
Hey hey… nanana… nana nana…
Hey hey… nanana… nana nana…
Hey hey… nanana… nanana nа…
