Rise, rise, balloon rise

Bada bada bada bada bada da
Bada bada bada bada bada da
Rise, rise, balloon rise
Rise, rise, balloon rise

I live dreaming, don't think bad of me
Isn't it better to live life this way?
In the wings of dreams, it's good to wander aimlessly
I don't need a visa and I don't use a passport

I have no limits, stopping is not for me
If I listen to my darling saying: "I'll go with you!"
Having that certitude is the light of a new day
Go, my golden balloon, wrapped in fantasy

Rise, rise, balloon rise
Rise and ask that star
If she will let me live and dream there
I will take my love with me
Because I know that I've found
The ideal place to love

Rise, rise, balloon rise
Rise and ask that star
If she will let me live and dream there
I'll take my love with me
Because I know that I've found
The ideal place to love

Rise, rise, balloon rise
Rise and ask that star
If she will let me live and dream there
I'll take my love with me
Because I know that I've found
The ideal place to love

Rise, rise, balloon rise
Rise and ask that star
If she will let me live and dream there
I'll take my love with me
Because I know that I've found
The ideal place to love

La la la la la la la…
La la la la la la la…
La la la la la la la…
La la la…

I'll take my love with me
Because I know that I've found
The ideal place to love
