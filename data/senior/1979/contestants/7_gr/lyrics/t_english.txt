Socrates

God… God… God… they never call you that
Candles… candles… candles… they never light them for you
But your words… words… they burn
And still… still… still… they are quoted
Socrates, you superstar

Pure and good, the first Christ
Socrates, you superstar
You went round in a beggar's clothing
And there were birds in your white beard

The crowd around you – you were a holy light
Socrates, you superstar
You talked to them about love and light
The wisest man, the king of wisdom

God… God… God… they never call you that
Candles… candles… candles… they never light them for you
But your words… words… they burn
And still… still… still… they are quoted
Socrates, you superstar

God… God… God… they never call you that
Candles… candles… candles… they never light them for you
But your words… words… they burn
And still… still… still… they are quoted
Socrates, you superstar

Pilate supporters took the light from you
Socrates, you superstar
And Athens, that you loved so much
Gave you a bitter poison

The break of day was bitter, the earth was orphaned
Socrates, you superstar
Your time had come
You found the eternal God

God… God… God… they never call you that
Candles… candles… candles… they never light them for you
But your words… words… they burn
And still… still… still… they are quoted
Socrates, you superstar

God… God… God… they never call you that
Candles… candles… candles… they never light them for you
But your words… words… they burn
And still… still… still… they are quoted
Socrates, you superstar… superstar… superѕtаr
