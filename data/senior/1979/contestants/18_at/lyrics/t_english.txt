Today in Jerusalem

Get up, lay down the sleep
In this time of bitter fruits
Friend, be vigilant
To fight against the crying and tears

Look, from the cold high sky
Fall a hundred moons
As a sign for the new beginning
As a sense against the nonsense

And today in Jerusalem
Finally in Jerusalem
Take breath and reflect
Today in Jerusalem
Peace for Jerusalem

Look, from the cold high sky
Fall a hundred moons
As a sign for the new beginning
As a sense against the nonsense

And today in Jerusalem
Finally in Jerusalem
Take breath and reflect
Today in Jerusalem
Peace for Jeruѕаlem
