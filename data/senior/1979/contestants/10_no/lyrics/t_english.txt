Oliver

(Do you, do you want the next dance?)
(Do you, do you want the next dance with me?)

Dance with me Oliver, Oliver
Dance, now you've got your chance
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver
Let the next dance, let the next dance be mine

The discotheque is loud
There is a fog of smoke everywhere
In the crowd I'm searching for you
Four weeks today since we went separate ways
I guess you're happy now
But if you walk by I'll say:
(Do you want the next dance?)

Dance with me Oliver, Oliver
Dance, now you've got your chance
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver
Let the next dance, let the next dance be mine
Oliver…

Fashionable and in
Yes, clothes can make anybody look so right
But now I think the clown is rather sad
Ooh… do you come here, even when your costume is worn out
And people can ѕee who you are?
Then you are at my door like before
(Do you want the next dance?)

Dance with me Oliver, Oliver
Dance, now you've got your chance
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver
Give me a dance, dance with me now

Dance with me Oliver, Oliver
Dance, take a chance on me
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver
Let the next dance, let the next dance be mine

(Dance with me Oliver, Oliver)
Dance, now you've got your chance
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver
Let the next dance, let the next dance be mine

(Dance with me Oliver, Oliver)
Dance, now you've got your chance
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver
Let the next dance, let the next dance be mine

(Dance with me Oliver, Oliver)
Dance, now you've got your chance
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver
Let the next dance, let the next dаnce be mine
