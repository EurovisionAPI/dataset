I've already seen that in your eyes

A big boat that moves away
Towards a blue-sky horizon
Streams flowing from the mountain
I've already seen that in your eyes

Blue or stormy skies
We, hand in hand, quietly
Both naked on a beach
I've already seen that in your eyes

In your eyes I see
The reflection of my whole life
My life that goes away
Irresistibly towards a neverending happiness

Oh, how many winters to think
You were going to leave the next day?
But wait a bit for my victory
And I promise you a summer

A very little land corner
Two or three children in the middle
We're sitting on a stone bench
I've already seen that in your eyes

A very little land corner
Under a big piece of blue sky
We're sitting on a ѕtone bench
And we will both get old

We both, we both
We both, if you wаnt
