Moon beam

If I sometimes seem to be deceitful, you don't know
There's a sincere world, which never lies

When a moon beam
Between the sky and the stars acknowledges me
And a gust of wind
Makes time lose its haste

When a moon beam
Erases every shade of doubt and falseness
I'll be freer and true, I'll fly sincerely to you

You're wrong if you think that I don't believe in you
If sometimes, it's normal, I can see only myself

But there's a moon beam
Waiting impatiently each evening because
It takes me back to a temple
Built for love which is only for you

When a moon beam
Can provide thought
With its biggest wings
I'll be freer and true, I'll fly sincerely to you

A moon beam is enough
To transform the sea into some jazz music
And stay on our own, both at home and outside
But always you and I

When a moon beam
Improvises each time a different note for us
It'll be our song, evening after evening
It'll be our ѕong, evening аfter evening
