Mary Ann

Out on a late night
Way after midnight
Armed with a bottle or two
What's the time?
I'm gettin' out of my mind
I've gotta get to you

She was in black lace
Come back to my place
Come for a drink and a dance
Boy, I found she didn't hang around
I didn't stand a chance

She paid a big rent
For an apartment uptown One-twenty-one
She said: come inside
I've got nothin' to hide
I only want some fun

Havin' a good time
Walkin' a tight line
I was out of my head
Just when I reached for you
Like I usually do
I found her instead

Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
But I can't do more than try
Tearin' my heart out tryin' to make it up to you
Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
That's truth, and that's no lie
Cryin' my eyes out, gotta get it back with you

I woke up early
With everythin' blurry
And my head rattled with pain
Even so, I heard the doorbell go
And someone call my name

There was her best friend
Down for the weekend
I knew I'd met her before
She said: you dirty man
When I see Mary Ann
I'm gonna tell her the score

Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
But I can't do more than try
Tearin' my heart out tryin' to make it up to you
Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
That's truth, and that's no lie
Cryin' my eyes out, gotta get it back with you

Out on a late night
Way after midnight
Armed with a bottle or two
What's the time?
I'm gettin' out of my mind
I've got to get to you

Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
But I can't do more than try
Tearin' my heart out tryin' to make it up to you
Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
That's truth, and that's no lie
Cryin' my eyes out, gotta get it back with you

Cryin' my eyeѕ out, gotta get it bаck with you
