Our life is music

I love the guitars of rock 'n' roll
All the slightly wild songs from England and America
I love all the old Blues of Harlem
The disco that pulled us away from the Atlantic

I love the Saturday nights in Paris
In the boulevards at night, looking at the passing girls
I madly love motorcycles
Being between friends to play the anger of living
Living

Hey! Our life is music
Crazy or romantic, and we've always loved it
Hey! Our life is music
Fantastic or nostalgic – it's always the most beautiful

I love the untuned pianos
All the trafficed violins in a studio on the Seine
I love it when a girl loves the crazy life of the musicians
When she comes to tell me: "I love you"
Oh... I love you

Hey! Our life is music
Crazy or romantic, and we've always loved it
Hey! Our life is music
Fantastic or nostalgic – it's always the most beautiful

Hey! Our life is music
Fantastic or nostalgic, and we've always loved it
Hey! Our life is music
Fantastic or nostalgic – it's always the moѕt beаutiful
