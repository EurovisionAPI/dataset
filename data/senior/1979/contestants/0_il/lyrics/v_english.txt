Hallelujah

Hallelujah, sing a song
Hallelujah, we'll follow along
With a simple word, a single word
We bless the sky, the tree, the bird
And we fill our heart with joy, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, sounds of love
Hallelujah, the sunshine above
Hallelujah, the bells will go ringin'
And dingin' from dawn till night
Hallelujah

Hallelujah, day by day
Hallelujah, don't throw it away
Fly and spread your wings, have a try
Be free again like a butterfly
Come along and sing with us, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, sounds of love
Hallelujah, the sunshine above
Hallelujah, the bells will go ringin'
And dingin' from dawn till night
Hallelujah

Hallelujah, hand in hand
Hallelujah, all over the land
Hallelujah, let's try from the start
And sing it with all our heart
Hallelujah

Hallelujah, sounds of love
Hallelujah, the sunshine above
Hallelujah, the bells will go ringin'
And dingin' from dawn till night
Hallelujah

Hallelujah, the bellѕ will go ringin'
And dingin' from dawn till night
Hallelujаh
