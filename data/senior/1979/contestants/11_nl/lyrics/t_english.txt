Colorado

Oh oh… Colorado, fly with me to Colorado
Oh oh… Colorado, over the sea to Colorado
Oh… Colorado, Colorado

The dollar is not so expensive anymore
Will you go with me and cross the ocean
To a life full of adventure?

The rivers are full of fish
With a wild bear on the photo
Colorado, Colorado

Oh oh… Colorado, fly with me to Colorado
Oh oh… Colorado, over the sea to Colorado
Oh… Colorado, Colorado

Let's buy a second-hand horse
Together a whole day in the saddle
Think of the petrol you would save

In the star night close to the fire
In your arms I'm dreaming
Colorado, Colorado

Oh oh… Colorado, fly with me to Colorado
Oh oh… Colorado, over the sea to Colorado
Oh… Colorado, Colorado

Oh oh… Colorado, fly with me to Colorado
Oh oh… Colorado, over the ѕea to Colorado
Oh… Colorado, Colorаdo
