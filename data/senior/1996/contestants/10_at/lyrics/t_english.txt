Now that it goes well with you

Everything goes by itself
Ooh… now that it goes well with you, yeah

When you wake up in the morning
No matter what time
You already have a very good feeling
That you simply take with you

It may snow, rain, thunder heavily
Everything goes by itself, now that it goes well with you

People who you don't know
Laugh friendly to you
Today is a day on which no one
Can be mad at you for nothing

What is that, what is happening there?
I think it's quite clear
You radiate something special
Now that it goes well with you

You can embrace the whole world
(Yes, no way out of it)
And the world can embrace you
(That is good for you)

Mmm… do you feel it? (Yeah)
Do you believe in it? (Yeah)
You can do whatever you want
Everything goes by itself, now that it goes well with you

(Now that it goes well with you)
Now that it goes well with you
(Now that it goes well with you)
Now that it goes well with you

You see problems melting like ice
(That does good)
This way you can still win
(And that encourages you)

Oh… do you feel it?
Do you believe in it?
You can do whatever you want
Everything goes by itself, now that it goes well with you
Everything goes by itself, now that it goes well with you
Mmm.. everything goes by itself, now that it goes well with you

You want to sing (sing)
You want to dance (dance)
Simply live (live), embrace everybody
Sing (sing), dance (dance), live
Everything goes by itself, now that it goes well with you

(Sing) sing, (dance) dance
(Live) Ooh… live, embrace people
Sing (sing), dance (dance), live
Everything goes by itself, now that it goes well with you

(Now that it goes well with you, yeah)
You have courage for everything, you don't give up
You're hoping the feeling never stops
(Now that it goes well with you, yeah)
Everything happens automatically
(Now that it goes well with you, yeah)
And around you, it's bright
(Now that it goes well with you, yeah)

Hold, laugh
(Now that it goes well with you, yeah)
Dance, sing, live
Whoa…
