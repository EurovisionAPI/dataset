We wear spring clothes in winter time

Sleep in my arms, and I will live in my summers
As if they were beloved films
Embrace my thoughts, and guess my words
As if you knew everything I wanted to say

And everything we've been taught can just persist
And everything we've been taught can just wait

We solve the difficult problems at night
We find new lovers on Sundays
We wear spring clothes in winter time

Put your head on my shoulder, make my fears go away
As if you were a special trick
Paint the day that is coming, and put on the radio
A song about love

And everything we've been taught can just persist
And everything we've been taught can just wait

We solve the difficult problems at night
We find new lovers on Sundays
We wear spring clothes in winter time

We solve the difficult problems at night
We find new lovers on Sundays
We weаr spring clotheѕ in winter time
