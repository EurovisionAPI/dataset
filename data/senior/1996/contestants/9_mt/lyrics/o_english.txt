In A Woman's Heart

Like a circle goin' round in my mind
Forever searchin' an answer I can't find
Strange attraction – man, you weave it so well
Pure fascination, I'm under your spell

Here I go again ignoring my senses
Nothing stops this love, and only a fool will tell

In a woman's heart, a dream is for life any day
In a woman's heart, together's an evening prayer
As I think of you, I'm wonderin' what halved us apart
There you go again forsakin' a woman's heart

Once you promised, seemed so true and sincere
Like rhymin' verses, sweet words rang in my ear
It ain't easy on tough moments like these
No pride can save me, I'm down on my knees

I can't free myself, I wasted my chances
Knockin' on your door, just let me in, hear my plea

In a woman's heart, a dream is for life any day
In a woman's heart, together's an evening prayer
As I think of you, I'm hopin' once more for a start
Every now and then you're breakin' a woman's heart

'Cause I know you're leavin'
(I know you're leavin')
Mmm, out of a woman's heart
Just keep right on heavin'
Beatin' for love that fell apart
Woman's heart

Ooh, whooh
There you go again
Woman's heart

In a woman's heart, a dream is for life any day
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(In a woman's heart)
As I think of you, I'm hopin' once more for a start
Every now and then you're breakin' a woman's heart, heart, heart
(In a woman's heart)
Woman, woman
(In a woman's heart)
