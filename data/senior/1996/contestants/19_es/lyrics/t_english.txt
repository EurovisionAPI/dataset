Oh, what desire!

I wanted to find your footprints under your feet
I wanted to look at the sky and be
A horizon of stars and sea
And sail along those coral seas
I'll search there where my dreams may come true
To be bound with your hair

(Oh, what desire) causes your skin
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey
(Oh, what desire) causes your skin
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey

(Among the foam to be) salt in the wide sea
(Making of your look) echoes of paradise
(Among the foam to be) bound inside of you
Echoes of love
A verse and a flower, oh, a verse and a flower

(Oh, what desire) causes your skin
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey
(Oh, what desire) causes your skin
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey

I wanted to find your footprints under your feet
I wanted to look at the sky and be
A horizon of stars and sea
And sail along those coral seas
I'll search there where my dreams may come true
To be bound with your hair

(Oh, what desire) causes your skin
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey
(Oh, what desire) causes your skin
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey

(Oh, what desire) causes your skin
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey
(Oh, what deѕire,) oh, yeah, yeаh
