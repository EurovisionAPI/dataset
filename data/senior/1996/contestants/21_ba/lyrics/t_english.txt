For our love

I'd give it all, everything in the world
To have you beside me
To have your arms around me
My love

To have you wake me up in the morning
With your warm lips
To have your hands touch mine
Stealing me away from dreams

The night is long when I'm without you
And every day, as if I'm dying
But I know I love you
And will wait hundred years

I can't be without you, I know
I'm living for only one day
For only one night, made of dreams
Only for our love, I live

I can't be without you, I know
I'm living for only one day
For only one night, made of dreаmѕ
Only for our love, I live
