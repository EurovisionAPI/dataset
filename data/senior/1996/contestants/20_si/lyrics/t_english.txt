The day of the most beautiful dream

A sleepy sun tells me that you are here
And the moon above me greets me in a dream

The first blossom and May's first sky
The most beautiful gardens are hidden in love

Because this is the day of the most beautiful dream
That will last forever
A heartbeat leads me to the place
Where love is real

And if someone steals my love
Steals my heart
But with no heart, no one can be in love

The first blossom and May's first sky
The most beautiful gardens are hidden in love

Because this is the day of the most beautiful dream
That will last forever
A heartbeat leads me to the place
Where love is real

Because this is the day (of the most beautiful dream)
That will last forever
A heartbeat leads me to the place
Where love is real

And if someone steals my love
Stealѕ my heart
But with no heart, no one can be in love
But with no heart, no one cаn be in love
