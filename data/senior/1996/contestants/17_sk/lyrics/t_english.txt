As long as you have us

I know, I am not evil
I miss one face, and a little hope
I still believe in something, there are only few such things
And I know, the love exists

The love is strong, it examines us
If we know how to endure the story of passion
Then, love, please, help me, let me succeed and find you
If I still have you

Love protect us, as long as you have us
Protect each our tune
Love protect us, as long as you have us
Shine while dreams are wandering in the dark

Sometimes I am cruel
As everyone having dreams, experienced long ago
Only in forgetting, perhaps I shall purify me
And I shall burn the shade in my soul

The love is strong, it examines us
If we know how to endure the story of passion
Then, love, please, help me, let me succeed and find you
If I still have you
