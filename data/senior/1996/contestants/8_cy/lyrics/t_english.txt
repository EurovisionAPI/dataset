Only for us

Tonight my sweetheart, the half moon
A cradle taking us to the sky
Let's leave the earth, and all its wounds

Let it wait till the dawn
This night, my darling, is a night of love

Only for us
All the stars of the sky
Turn into boats and fall into the ocean
So, make as many wishes you want
There's no room for guilts in our night
Live the thrills of joy
They're only for us

Only for us

Only for us
All the stars of the sky
Turn into boats and fall into the ocean
So, make as many wishes you wаnt
There's no room for guilts in our night
Live the thrills of joy
They're only for us

Only for us
Only for uѕ
