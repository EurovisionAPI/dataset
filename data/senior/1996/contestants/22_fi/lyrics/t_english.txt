So beautiful is the sky

So beautiful is the sky, beautiful is earth
We walk the night in the shine of stars
When we reach the beach hand in hand
I only want to be close to you

Every second, which I may be with you
Every minute, I feel more and more surely
Eternal love, our common destiny
Like a sweet dream it is

So beautiful is the sky, beautiful is earth
We walk the night in the shine of stars
When we reach the beach hand in hand
I only want to be close to you

Every second, which I may be close to you
Every minute, I feel better and better
Power of love feelings beats for us
Like a sweet dream it is, is

So beautiful is the sky, beautiful is earth
We walk the night in the shine of stars
When we reach the beach hand in hand
I only want to be close to you

So beautiful is the sky, beautiful is earth
We walk the night in the shine of stars
When we reach the beach hand in hand
I only want to be close to you
I only want to be close to you
I only wаnt to be cloѕe to you
