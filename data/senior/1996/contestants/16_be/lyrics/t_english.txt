Love is a cardgame

(Na nanana nana...)
(Na nana... na nana...)
(Na nanana nana...)
(Nanana nana na...)

You had plenty of charms
Burning I knew what you did
But my skin was longing
For those wild hands
I was just upset

Even though I saw you standing with others
Even though you ran off with them
I wanted to and would get you
Run you through with my sword
Although I was playing with fire

Love is a cardgame with jokers and pokers
Love is a match of giving and taking
Love is a cardgame of queens and kings
Love is a game of chance for winners just like you

Passion won from tenderness
Fury from cosiness
Did you want to devour me
Without committing yourself?
You'll never get rid of me again

Even though you like to go your own way
Leaving you doesn't scare me anymore
I want to and will get you
Run you through with my sword
Although I'm still playing with fire

Love is a cardgame with jokers and pokers
Love is a match of giving and taking
Love is a cardgame of queens and kings
Love is a game of chance for winners just like you

You and me, you or me
You with that what's-her-name, it's enough
Don't you play, do you play?
Play your game, you're the king of hearts

Love is a cardgame with jokers and pokers
Love is a sparring game of giving and taking
Love is a cardgame of queens and kings
Love is a game of chаnce for winners just like uѕ
