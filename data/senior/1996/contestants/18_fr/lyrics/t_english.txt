May you blossom, children

Come near, children
Dusk and dawn
Give me courage
The future frightens me

The country people's wisdom
Warms up your hearts
And the waking slopes
On the lands around the black pond

May you blossom, children
The hard fights and agreement
You speak straight words
And so beautiful is your way
To use the language
That I miss, allas

May you blossom, children
The yellow mountains
With the nostalgia of the old celebrations
Between your lips is the truth

May you blossom, children
With your eyes wet from laughter
And your sorrows silenced
May you blossom, children

May you blossom, children
The hard fights and agreement
You speak straight words
And so beautiful is your way
To use the language
That I miss, allаѕ
