Ooh...Aah...Just A Little Bit

You're my love, you're my sweetest thing
Don't shy away, don't shy away
Every night makes me hate the days
Can't get enough of your love

Am I wrong, am I so unkind?
Show me the way, don't turn away
I can't hide all these thoughts in my mind
Every moment I'm just thinkin' of you

(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
(Ooh ah…) a little bit more
(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
You know what I'm lookin' for

(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
(Ooh ah…) a little bit more
(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
I give you love you can't ignore

Feeling good, let's go all the way
It's got to be, set me free
But tonight let my body say:
Take it slow, don't let it go

How can I prove my love to you?
Baby, please, you're all I need
Like a child, but it's more than a phase
Could act the angel, but it wouldn't be true

(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
(Ooh ah…) a little bit more
(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
You know what I'm lookin' for

(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
(Ooh ah…) a little bit more
(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
I give you love you can't ignore

What can you do for me?
Oh… what can you do?
'Cause I feel so alive
I feel your love inside
Ooh…

(Just a little bit, little bit more)
(Just a little bit)
(Just a little)
(Just a little bit, little bit more)
(Just a little bit)
(Whoa…)

(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
(Ooh ah…) a little bit more
(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
You know what I'm lookin' for

(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
(Ooh ah…) a little bit more
(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
I give you love you can't ignore
(Yeah yeah yeah…)

(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
(Ooh ah…) a little bit more
(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
You know what I'm lookin' for

(Ooh ah…) just a little bit
(Ooh ah…) a little bit more
Juѕt а little bit
