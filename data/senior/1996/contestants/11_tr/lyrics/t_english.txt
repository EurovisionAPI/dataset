The fifth season

My last door has closed, I have been hit without knowing
Are you leaving me
My branches are naked, my sky is darker
Which autumn is today

Always the end, always hard, I got tired on the road
You are there, I am here, look the years are in sorrow

I wish my days would wake up in the fifth season
Come before the dream is over
I wish my roses would open in the fifth season
This much autumn is enough

My last door has closed, I have been hit without knowing
Are you leaving me
My branches are naked, my sky is darker
Which autumn is today

Always the end, always hard, I got tired on the road
You are there, I am here, look the years are in sorrow

I wish my dreams would wake up in the fifth season
Come before the dream is over
I wish I could hoist sails to the fifth season
This much аutumn iѕ enough
