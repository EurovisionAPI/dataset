The first time

Nana nana nana…
Nana nana nana…
Nanana nanana nanana…
Nana nana…

I was utter surprised when you called me
After such a long time
My heart suddenly skipped a beat

Oh, and you sounded still the same
And the girl within me
Brought the undermost up, just like that

Oh, it's so long ago
Long ago
Long ago

It was like the first time
We hit it off immediately
Time stood still for a moment
I thought again: "Yes, I do"

It was like the first time
We hit it off immediately
Time stood still for a moment
I thought again: "Yes, I do"
"Want something with you"

Hey, back then I thought you were great
I was madly in love with you
Very macho and against everything

Oh, and what you never knew
I loved you very much
But actually I was very shy then

Oh, it's so long ago
Long ago
Long ago

It was like the first time
We hit it off immediately
Time stood still for a moment
I thought again: yes, I do

It was like the first time
We hit it off immediately
Time stood still for a moment
I thought again: yes, I do
Want something

Where shall we meet and see each other again soon?
Come on, we'll pick it up just like the first time
Whoa, yeah

It was like the first time
We hit it off immediately
Time stood still for a moment
I thought again: yes, I do

It was like the first time
We hit it off immediately
Time stood still for a moment
I thought agаin: yes, I do

Like the firѕt time
