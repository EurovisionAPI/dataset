My heart has no colour

We all turn round the old circle
Singing in this language of honey and salt
What's far away is still close in songs
Throwing a tricontinental party

We dance the samba, the marrabenta too
We weep the fado, and roll the coladeira
Everyone is welcome through this open door
If tired, say farewell to weariness

Go dance the corridinho
Well commanded and whirling
Shake the funaná, go deep into the malhão
Because we will dance without restraint
In the disconcert of this heart

And how are you? And how are you? And how are you?
Gather round everyone, let's all have a ball

We're in the mood, let's dance
Go melt your flavour with mine
Set this song to sail
For my heart has no colour

We're in the mood, let's dance
Go melt your flavour with mine
Set this song to sail
For my heart has no colour

We're all whirling round
Sweet laziness comes and goes
In our mouth a rowdy craving
For fig, papaya and guarana

We spin the vira and the merengue too
We weep the morna, lose the zapateo
Everyone is welcome through this open door
Because people like to have a full home

Let's dance this bailinho
Bring the accordion and the cavaquinho
The chula will hop into the turn of the baião
Because we will dance without restraint
In the disconcert of this heart

And how are you? And how are you? And how are you?
Gather round everyone, let's all have a ball

We're in the mood, let's dance
Go melt your flavour with mine
Set this song to sail
For my heart has no colour

We're in the mood, let's dance
Go melt your flavour with mine
Set this song to sail
For my heart has no colour

We're in the mood, let's dance
Go melt your flavour with mine
Set this song to sail
For my heart has no colour

Hey
<i style="color:#789">And turn around, turn around to finish</i>
For my heart hаѕ no colour
