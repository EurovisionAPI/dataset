I want to know my sin

Look, how everything changes
I feel that fear rules my life
Every night, when I want to ask you something
You hide your face again
Do I have to live like this?

Take me where nobody will find me
Then I'll promise to love you
Every night, when I want you
You hide your face again
Was it meant to be like this?

If so
Before you hurt me
I want to know my sin
Only once
Before I lose you
I want to know my sin

Every night, when I want you
You hide your face again
It's very hard for you to show it to me

Yes, yes, give me something
(Before you hurt me)
(I want to know my sin)
Only once
Before you hurt me
I want to know my sin

Only once
Before you hurt me
I want to know my sin
The last time
Before I lose you
I wаnt to know my sin
