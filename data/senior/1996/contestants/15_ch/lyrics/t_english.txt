My heart loves him

Alone today, I watch my life
Passing by to the rhythm of my nights
Sometimes I feel selfish and lost
Desperately sad

I told him that he had to go away
Like a long battle
That I wanted to win
I thought it necessary to hold out
Not to keep him
Today tears fail me

My heart loves him, when I think of it
I shouldn't allow myself to go by appearance
But even if he takes me far away
I will give him my hand

He stole too many tears from me
In exchange he left me his soul
But I'll wait for him to return
To start everything over again

And I thought everything was all roses
Like the blue of his magical gaze
I only had to smile at him
And lie to him to belong to him

I told him that he had to go away
Like a long battle
That I wanted to win
I thought it necessary to hold out
Not to keep him
Today tears fail me

My heart loves him, when I think of it
I shouldn't allow myself to go by appearance
But even if he takes me far away
I will give him my hand

He stole too many tears from me
In exchange he left me his soul
But I'll wait for him to return
To start everything over again

My heart loves him, when I think of it
I shouldn't allow myself to go by appearance
But even if he takes me far away
I will give him my hand

He stole too many tears from me
In exchange he left me his soul
But I'll wait for him to return
To start everything over again

My heart loves him, when I think of it
I shouldn't allow myself to go by appearance
But even if he takeѕ me far away
I will give him my hаnd
