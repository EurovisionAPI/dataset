Shoobe-doo

(Shoobe-doobe doo)
Louis he sang alot shoobe-doo
Sarah and Ella too
Frankie he sang "New York, New York"
And shoobe-doo, shoobe-doo

Did you hear Sammy, shoobe-doo?
Didn't Nat Cole sing along?
D'you remember Elvis singing "Love Me Tender"?
And shoobe-doo, shoobe-doo

Shoobe-doo, shoobe-doo
People understand it even on Skagaströnd and Timbuktu
Shoobe-doo, shoobe-doo
In the whole world, all together shoobe-doo

Dizzy he adored shoobe-doo
Adorably did few tones
And Billie Holliday on a late night sang much
Shoobe-doo, shoobe-doo

Shoobe-doo, shoobe-doo
People understand it even on Skagaströnd and Timbuktu
Shoobe-doo, shoobe-doo
In the whole world, all together shoobe-doo

The tones' language in every soul
Sung with the feeling in our heart
No matter where, the singing will go
Gliding on it's wings through space

(Shoobe-doo, shoobe-doo) Shoobe-doo
People understand it even from Skagаströnd to Timbuktu
Shoobe-doo, ѕhoobe-doo
(Shoobe-doobe-doo) Shoobe-doobe-doo
