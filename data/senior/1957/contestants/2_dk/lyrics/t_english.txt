The ship is leaving tonight

Goodbye then, my lass, stay well
I confess, my heart gives kind of a twinge
While I'm kissing you now
I love you
But the ship is leaving tonight
But the ship is leaving tonight

We met in fun, we courted a little
But what was carelessness, suddenly became serious
And you became everything to me
Now there's only you
But the ship is leaving tonight
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight

We're making a plan, we're dreaming a dream
We're fighting forward, despite head wind and current
Towards what we want so badly
Then suddenly we see
That the ship is leaving tonight
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight

Evening in the sign of the new moon
Two standing in the dark on the quay
Girl and man
One from the sea, one from land
Everything is said, now they're just standing there
In silence
Finally she says:

Goodbye then, my friend, take care of yourself
I think, you've been so nice and fair
And I'll be faithful to you
My life became the two of us
But the ship is leaving tonight
But the ship is leaving tonight

Although I'm yours, with mind and body
And now I can make a fuss and resist
Against what I know will happen
And cry and beg
For the ship is leaving tonight
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight

Suddenly the world stops
You hear the signal bell sounding
Your hopes lie broken, every single one
We humans mean so little

The happiness, we think is firm and solid
It's only on an indefinite shore leave
For everything, we own, must go
We think, it is ours
But the ship is leaving tonight
Yes, the ship iѕ leаving tonight
