Telephone, telephone

Hello – how do you do?
Hello – thank you very much
That's what I hear from every country
Hello – thanks, yes, yes
Hello – nothing for me
My heart is already taken, no sir

Telephone, telephone, whenever your call is heard
At the very first ring I ask myself, what news you'll bring
Telephone, telephone, time goes by silently
I've been waiting a long long time, yesterday and also today

You know my great desire
For the most beautiful thing in the world
Which keeps my heart and my soul
Breathing, day and night

Telephone, telephone, for a long time I've been alone
Tell me, when will I be rewarded with happiness at last?

Hello – at last, darling
Hello – what, tomorrow morning?
Tell me, why don't you come tonight?
Hello – don't hang up yet
Hello – I'm alone
And I've been thinking about you the whole day

Telephone, telephone, whenever your call is heard
At the very first ring I ask myself, what news you'll bring
Telephone, telephone, time goes by silently
I've been waiting a long long time, yesterday and also today

You know my great desire
For the most beautiful thing in the world
Which keeps my heart and my soul
Breathing, day and night

Telephone, telephone, for a long time I've been alone
Tell me, when will I be rewarded with happiness at last?

Hello? Oh, I can't talk аnymore
My song iѕ ending – goodbye, good night
