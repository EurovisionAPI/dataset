Where, little pony?

Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?
Where should my song accompany us today?
To your herds, the little horses?
There the valleys are immensely wide

Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?
Where should my song accompany us today?
To the green pasture, there in the moorland
Where once I've kissed, at the time of roses

Today is a day only for both of us
And you and me are carefree
Who else sees the world as beautiful
As beautiful as we see it?

Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?
My song will truely acompany both of us
And through the fields, the wide fields
It sounds in the wind, how happy we are

Today is a day only for both of us
And you and me are carefree
Who else sees the world as beautiful
As beautiful as we see it?

Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?
My song will truely acompаny both of us
And through the fields, the wide fields
Sounds for both of uѕ, my herippihei
