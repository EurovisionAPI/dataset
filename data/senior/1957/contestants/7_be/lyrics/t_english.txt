Street tune

Along the streets, a tune is dancing
And for a moment I stand still
Where is that pretty tune
All of a sudden coming from?

It's playing in the trees
Frolicking in the wind
It can't be bridled
It's soon becoming my friend

Along the streets, a tune is floating
It's as if a sunbeam
Is penetrating with that pretty tune
Into the most little portal

Tralalala tralala tralalala…
Tralalala tralala tralalala…

Along the streets, a tune is dancing
It's heard by young and old
Oh, how such a simple tune
Can become indispensable so quickly

It knocks on the windows
Asks: "Let me in"
I can easily whistle it
It makes me good-humoured

Along the streets, a tune is floating
It follows me everywhere
And I hope that this pretty tune
Will alwayѕ remain my friend

Tralalala tralala tralalala…
Tralalala lalala tralalalа…
