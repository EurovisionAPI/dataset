All

All the golden dreams of yesterday
All the fragrance of a bygone May
All the words two hearts in love can say
All you'll ever mean to me, my darling

All we've shared throughout the passing years
All the laughter, all the sighs, the tears
All the joy of living, loving and forgiving
These are all to me

All the laughter, all the sighs, the tears
All the joy of living, loving and forgiving
Theѕe are аll to me
