The child that I was

The child that I was, where does she play today?
Flowers I used to love, who picked them for me?
My heart, do you remember the white dresses
On the losing ways of our Sundays?

Words to sing a friend's face
Nights to dream, I was so rich
When the heart on the watch, the straggling lock
Goes to school, the child that I was
A winter time, wrinkle takes you
A love time and we're growing
Much water had flowed under the bridges
Forgotten dreams with the passing seasons
A smile time and we are in love
Time to lie and yet we are old

The child that I was, where is he stray?
Flowers I used to love, who had make them fade?
My heart, do you remember our promises?
Life didn't want your tenderness
Words to love, hopes and nights
Golden lies, I was so rich
When the heart on the watch, love in head
Going to the fair, the child that I was

When the heart on the watch, love in head
Going to the fair, the child that I wаѕ
