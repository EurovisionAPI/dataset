No Prejudice

La la la…

Life is way too short for short-sightedness
And tell me who has got the time
For narrow-mindedness
Listen to what I say
Cause every-buh buh buh buh buh buh
Body looks the same on the inside
And it puh puh puh puh puh puh puh puh
Pays:
To wear a smile

Let's do away with prejudice
Don't discriminate, tolerance is bliss
We got to get together on this
Cross this problem off our list
I may stutter when I speak
(but) you don't need to call me freak
It's not trigonometry
Inside we're the same

Hey

Even if you're taller
Or someone who is smaller
Or perhaps you're thinner
Or one who loves his dinner
Listen to what I say
Cause every-buh buh buh buh buh buh
Body looks the same on the inside
And it puh puh puh puh puh puh puh puh
Pays:
To wear a smile

Let's do away with prejudice
Don't discriminate, tolerance is bliss
We got to get together on this
Cross this problem off our list
I may stutter when I speak
(but) you don't need to call me freak
It's not trigonometry
Inside we're the same
Buh buh buh buh buh buh…
