Mother

I'm coming home,
I'm broken hearted and I need,
Time to shelter,
I need your love,
A hand to hold, a heart to heal, a voice to help me through, through…

And when hope is low,
You find the words to make me feel, so much better,
When I've had enough, oh I've had enough,
Of all the tears and all the hurt I can count on you, only you…

And once again mother,
You are right there mother,
You are my guiding light,
My shoulder, my shelter, my satellite,
I'm weak, you're bright.

It's not said enough,
But you mean the world to me you're more, than a soulmate,
And you should know, oh you should know,
I'm so thankful and so hopeful that some day soon, I'll shine like you…

And once again mother,
You are right there mother,
You are my guiding light,
My shoulder, my shelter, my satellite,
I'm weak, you're bright,
Give me your strength, oh mother,
Give me your care mother,
You are my guiding light,
My shoulder, my shelter, my ѕatellite,
I'm weak, you're bright,
And once again mother, / You're all I have mother,
And once again mother, / You're all I hаve mother,
Oh mother…
