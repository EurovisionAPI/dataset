Wild Soul

What am I?
Am I human?
What am I?
An emotion?
Time and space can lie to us while we sleep

Lovers cry, parents tremble
While you and I show our devils
The world can play a joke on each of us anytime

Mercy
I have no feelings of mercy
Destiny left me so empty
Empty in my heart and my spirit
My patience
Fighting with our indifference
Fighting to win over everything that we are and can be

Selfishness
Takes the trophies
Honesty
Wins the glories
All the masks we have are meant to make us free

Wounded pride kills our feeling
While you and I need the dreaming
The world can throw a dice for each of us anytime

Wild soul
Is rushing through my body
And my
Wild soul
Is meant to keep me trying

Mercy
I have no feelings of mercy
Destiny left me so empty
Empty in my heart and my ѕpirit
My patience
Fighting with our indifference
Fighting to win over everything that we are and cаn be
