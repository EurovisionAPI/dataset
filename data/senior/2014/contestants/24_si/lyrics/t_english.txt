Round and Round

Uncertain, inbetween worlds
Round and round, trapped in time
When you already know all the windstorms you're playful
But by yourself

And now
I'm gonna show you how to breathe
I'm gonna show you how to live
(I'm gonna hold your heart in hand)
I'm gonna make you understand

You don't know you don't know
Is it love is it hate
What are we changing
(What are we doing)
You don't know you don't but
Can you feel it inside
Feel the roses
Feel the pride
(Can you believe it)

Round and round again we …
Round and round again we go …
Round and round again we …
Round and round again we go…

Is a moment just a circle
Just a song you play on repeat?
If we can't change how we're living
Isn't life just a lie that we feed

And now
I'm gonna show you how to breathe
I'm gonna show you how to live
(I'm gonna hold your heart in hand)
I'm gonna make you understand

You don't know you don't know
Is it love is it hate
What are we changing
(What are we doing)
You don't know you don't but
Can you feel it inside
Feel the roses
Feel the pride
(Can you believe it)

Round and round again we …
Round and round again we go …
Round and round again we …
Round and round again we go…

When the sky won't cover our dreams
We're reborn (We will meet)
When the sky won't have the right ideas
Again it will be our time (To shine)

Again everything will be the same, again everything will be the same
As it was, oh-oh…
Only the heart will not be the same anymore
As it was, everything as it wаѕ
