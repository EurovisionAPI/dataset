Round and Round

Negotovi med svetovi
Krog za krogom ujeti v čas
Ko že veš za vse viharje
Si razigran, a vendar si sam

And now
I'm gonna show you how to breathe
I'm gonna show you how to live
(I'm gonna hold your heart in hand)
I'm gonna make you understand

You don't know you don't know
Is it love is it hate
What are we changing
(What are we doing)
You don't know you don't but
Can you feel it inside
Feel the roses
Feel the pride
(Can you believe it)

Round and round again we …
Round and round again we go …
Round and round again we …
Round and round again we go…

Is a moment just a circle
Just a song you play on repeat?
If we can't change how we're living
Isn't life just a lie that we feed

And now
I'm gonna show you how to breathe
I'm gonna show you how to live
(I'm gonna hold your heart in hand)
I'm gonna make you understand

You don't know you don't know
Is it love is it hate
What are we changing
(What are we doing)
You don't know you don't but
Can you feel it inside
Feel the roses
Feel the pride
(Can you believe it)

Round and round again we …
Round and round again we go …
Round and round again we …
Round and round again we go…

Ko nebo ne bo prekrilo najinih sanj
Prerojena (Bova spoznala)
Ko nebo ne bo imelo pravih idej
Spet bo najin čas (Da bi sijala)

Spet vse bo isto, spet vse bo tisto
Kar je bilo, oh-oh…
Le srce bo tisto ki ne bo več isto
Kar je bilo, vѕe kаr je bilo
