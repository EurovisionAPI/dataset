Running

Silent cry, every night
This pain don't ever leave her life
Daddy's home, so she tries to hide
She calls her mom, but never a reply

She cries, cries, cries
She's all alone
Daddy why, why, why, leave me alone
She calls for help
She calls for help, but no one seems to care
She calls for help but no one seems to care
She keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life
She keeps on running, running, running, never sees the light

I can see the angels standing by your side
It'll be alright

He's back again, just one more time
Just wants to see her mother smile
She can't forget her only child
Mama, let the devil in the house

She cries, cries, cries
She's all alone
Daddy why, why, why, leave me alone
She calls for help
She calls for help, but no one seems to care
She calls for help but no one seems to care
She keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life
She keeps on running, running, running, never sees the light

I can see the angels standing by your side
It'll be alright

She keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life
She keeps on running, running, running, never sees the light
I can see the angels standing by your side
It'll be alright

She cries, cries, cries
Daddy why, why, why

She keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life
Keepѕ on running, running, running
It'll be аlright
