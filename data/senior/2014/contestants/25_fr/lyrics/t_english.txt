Moustache

I miss something, but what?
I want this, I want that
When I sleep, I dream of dollars
Everyday I have a new suit

With me everything is new, everything is beautiful
The world weeps behind my curtains
I do not care I live on the top floor
I do not even know my housekeeper

There's leather in my car
The smell of my fragrance reassures me
I don't like showing my emotions
At the gym

I lift some weights
My body is a war machine
I have everything you dream to have
I may be all that is true but

I want a moustache
Moustache Moustache Moustache
Moustache Moustache Moustache
I wanna have a moustache, a moustache
A moustache, want a moustache

I want this, I want that
There's never enough for me
It's like this, it's like that
There is always something I don't have

I want this, I want that
There's never enough for me
It's like this, it's like that
There is always something I don't have

I want this, I want that
It's like this, it's like that
I want this, I want that
It's like this, it's like that
There is always something I don't have

So I still add
Tonnes of things behind my closet
I have friends still
And I even have friends who love me

I tell myself I have it all
I have everything, I have the world at my feet
This is crazy
I have everything you dream you have
I may be all that is true but

I want a moustache
Moustache Moustache Moustache
Moustache Moustache Moustache
I wanna have a moustache, a moustache
A moustache, want a moustache

I want this, I want that
There's never enough for me
It's like this, it's like that
There is always something I don't have

I want this, I want that
There's never enough for me
It's like this, it's like that
There is always something I don't have

I'd give everything I have
For a moustache
Now I know
What I want is
A moustache

I'd leave everything
Give it all
For a moustache
I may be all that is true
But this is not what I wanted

I want this, I want that
There's never enough for me
It's like this, it's like that
There is always something I don't have

I want this, I want that
There's never enough for me
It's like this, it's like that
There is always something I don't have

But I wanted a mouѕtаche
