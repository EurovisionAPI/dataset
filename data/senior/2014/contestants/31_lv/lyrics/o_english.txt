Cake To Bake

I melted the ice of the polar caps
Found the raiders of the lost ark
Solved a case for the genius from Baker Street
Helped to clean the Central Park
I created the plan for the Chinese wall
Went to desert, made it rain
Swam through a shark tank bloodily
Found Atlantis, by the way… (but today)

I've got a cake to bake – I've got no clue at all
(cep, cep, cep, cep, cep kuuku)
I've got a cake to bake – and haven't done that before
(cep, cep, cep, cep, cep kuuku)
Don't be proud, mate please don't bother
Go, come on and ask your mother
How to bake, how to bake, bake that cake…

Cep cep cep cep cep kuuku kuuku cep cep cep cep cep cep kuuku
Cep cep cep cep cep kuuku kuuku cep cep cep

I talked to a unicorn the other night
Took me up on a lonely star
Did the moonwalk on the milky way
Realised I've gone too far
So I questioned the law of gravity
Put the apple back up to the apple tree
Ej tu nost: I even learned Latvian
I know it's so hard to believe… (and today)

I've got a cake to bake – I've got no clue at all
(cep, cep, cep, cep, cep kuuku)
I've got a cake to bake – and haven't done that before
(cep, cep, cep, cep, cep kuuku)
Don't be proud, mate please don't bother
Go, come on and ask your mother
How to bake, how to bake, bake that cake (piece of cake)

Cep cep cep cep cep kuuku kuuku cep cep cep cep cep cep kuuku
Cep cep cep cep cep kuuku kuuku cep cep cep

We've got a cake to bake – and got no clue at all
We've got a cake to bake – and haven't done that before
Don't be proud, mate please don't bother
Go, come on and ask your mother
How to bake, how to bake, bake that cake (piece of cake)

Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake, wait for it
Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake, wait for it
Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake, have some cake
Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake

Go, come on and aѕk your mother
How to bake, how to bake, bake that cаke
