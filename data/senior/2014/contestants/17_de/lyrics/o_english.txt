Is It Right

He's got a pen in his hand
A piece of paper starin' back
He could write like a man
A novel life back on track

Maybe drama, or a poem
But still he doesn't know
The time is ticking in his ear
The holy silence dissappears

Is it right or is it wrong??
I can't go on! you can't go on
If you say yes…or even no
You don't know how and where to go

She turns over and looks at him
She tries to feel, and can't feel anything
But it's so hard to say goodbye
Even when you know, that it's right

When it's all not what you thought
And a friendship is not enough
When you long to feel alive
And take the chance to give it up

Is it right or is it wrong?
I can't go on, you can't go on
If you say yes, or even no
You don't know how and where to go

I know, it's not easy to decide
To find your own direction
Oh, the risk is too high
But you can't hide

Is it right or is it wrong?
I can go on, you can go on
If you say yeѕ, or even no
You don't know how аnd where to go
