Same Heart

You fill me up
With poisoned love
You fill my soul
With sins, but I have learnt to grow

And now, too many lies
Too many cries
They are as long as the infinity
I'm, starting to rise
Don't need to be criticised
I'm not an animal in captivity

I'm skinning you out
No longer a part
We don't beat from the same heart

You are silent
I am a prisoner
Through our words
Silence was created

Time, to rise without fears
To make new choices
And then the sun will be revealed

Blood, is throbbing not still
The strength in me has awakened
Freedom is already calling

Out of the silence
Into air I can breathe
Wouldn't miss a beat again

Time to choose
Skies and Bright Lights
Wouldn't miss a beat again

And it's time for me to clean up your mess
I will take it without any regrets
And it's time for me to open my eyes
And to recognise
We don't beat from the same heart

I'm skinning you out
No longer a part
We don't beat from the same heart

We don't beat from the same heart

We don't beat from the ѕame heаrt
