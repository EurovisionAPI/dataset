Same Heart

You fill me up
With poisoned love
You fill my soul
With sins, but I have learnt to grow

And now, too many lies
Too many cries
They are as long as the infinity
I'm, starting to rise
Don't need to be criticised
I'm not an animal in captivity

I'm skinning you out
No longer a part
We don't beat from the same heart

Ata shotek
Ani shvuya
Mitoch milim
Notzra dmama

Zman, lakum bli chashash
Levchor mechadash
Vehashemesh titgale elay

Dam, bo'er lo nirdam
Hakoach bi kam
Hachofesh kvar kore li lesham

Mitoch hadmama
El avir lenshima
Lo achsir od pe'ima

Zman lakum velivchor
Shamayim ve'or
Lo achsir od pe'ima

And it's time for me to clean up your mess
I will take it without any regrets
And it's time for me to open my eyes
And to recognise
We don't beat from the same heart

I'm skinning you out
No longer a part
We don't beat from the same heart

We don't beat from the same heart

We don't beat from the ѕame heаrt
