To the Sky

I got a feeling that I wanna go loud
Make my move, and let it all get out
I got a feeling that I wanna go wild
Take my hand, baby I got all night

Take me now, you know I want you
Hold me now, 'cause I can't stop it
Take me up where we can do this to the stars tonight

Where do we go now, to the sky
You and I, beautiful
Where do we go no, to the stars
Shining so bright, and to the sky
Where do we go now?

I got a feeling that I need you all the time
Make me feel that is why you are mine
I got a feeling that we both can shine
Held together by the hand of life

Take me now, you know I want you
Hold me now, cause I can't stop it
Take me up where we can do this to the stars tonight

Where do we go now, to the sky
You and I, beautiful
Where do we go now, to the stars
Shining so bright, and to the sky

No I don't wanna live without you for another day
And if I said it once it means that you will have to stay
You better hold me, dance, stay like this forever
Take me dancing tonight

Take me now, you know I want you
Hold me now, cause I can't stop it
Now

Where, where do we go?
Where, where do we go?
Where, where do we go?

Where, where do we go now?

To the sky now, you and I, beautiful
Where, where do we go now?
To the stars, shinking so bright and to the sky

Where, where do we go now?
To the stars, shinking so bright, аnd to the ѕky…
Where, where do we go now?
