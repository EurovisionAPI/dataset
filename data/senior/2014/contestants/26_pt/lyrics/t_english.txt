I Want to Be Yours

UAUAUÉ ! UAUÉ
UAUAUÉ ! UAUÉ

On my wings
I want to take you to the sky
And on thousand clouds
Give you all that I have

I want to be
Your passion cupid
I want to be
The owner of your heart

I want to be yours, OH OH OH OH OH

I want to be yours like the sun is of its light
I want to be yours like a river is of its sea

I want to be yours, OH OH OH OH OH

I want to be yours like the honey of your kiss
I want to be yours I was born to love you

UAUAUÉ ! UAUÉ

That guides your way
I want to take you
To the sweet world of tenderness

I want to bathe
In your body of pleasure
And satisfy
My thirst for you

I want to be yours, OH OH OH OH OH
I want to be yours, OH OH OH OH OH
I want to be yours like the sun is of its light
I want to be yours like a river is of its sea

I want to be yours, OH OH OH OH OH
I want to be yours, OH OH OH OH OH
I want to be yours like the honey of your kiss
I want to be yours I was born to love you
