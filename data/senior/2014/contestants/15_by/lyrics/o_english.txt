Cheesecake

Once I gave you one more chance
You showed me dance
But I'm not Patrick Swayzee
You're not Jennifer Gray

I told this story
But I'm so sorry
I lost my train of thought
When you called me, "My sweet Cheesecake"

I don't wanna be your toy perhaps today
I'm not gonna be your boyfriend
It's too late
I look over all the maps trying to escape
'Cause I'm tired of being your sweet cheesecake

I don't wanna be your toy perhaps today
I'm not gonna be your boyfriend
It's too late
I look over all the maps trying to escape
'Cause I'm tired of being your sweet cheesecake

Hey I will fly far away
By any plane just not to meet you
On my way, don't stay, hay

You dial my number
Your dreams start crumbling
You want me to be the man I'll never ever be

I don't wanna be your toy perhaps today
I'm not gonna be your boyfriend
It's too late
I look over all the maps trying to escape
'Cause I'm tired of being your sweet cheesecake

I don't wanna be your toy perhaps today
I'm not gonna be your boyfriend
It's too late
I look over all the maps trying to escape
'Cause I'm tired of being your sweet cheesecake

I don't want to be your toy
I don't want to be your boy

I don't wanna
I don't wanna be your toy
I don't wanna
I don't wanna be your boy

I don't wanna

I don't wanna be your toy perhaps today
I'm not gonna be your boyfriend
It's too late
I look over all the maps trying to escape
'Cause I'm tired of being your sweet cheeѕecake
