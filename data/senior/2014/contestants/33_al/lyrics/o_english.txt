One Night's Anger

Say no, let go, keep your breath, as the anger flows
I Know, you know, words can hurt, you'll regret them though
So say say say say you'll be there when the words are done
Don't give in your pride
Keep calm and think twice

Free your mind from the doubts that are tickling
Free your heart, and let the peace enlighten your feelings
Sun will rise, and the light will be clearing
The tides of the night
Keep calm and think twice

Say no, let go, night will fade and the day will glow
I know, you know, that the morning is brighter so
Please say say say say you'll be there when the words are done
Don't give in your pride
Let go and don't cry

Free your mind from the doubts that are tickling
Free your heart, and let the peace enlighten your feelings
Sun will rise, and the light will be clearing
The tides of the night
Keep calm and think twice

Wait a tick tiny tick, you'll forget it (just wanna make it right)
Wait a tick tiny tick, you'll regret it (I want to let it out)
Anything iѕn't it you want to get it
Maybe tomorrow, will be lаte to get by
