Three Minutes To Earth

Shin… Shin…

Home, home, through the star trail of a lonely star
Home to the Earth where we belong, belong to…
Dazzling light of mankind's emotion:
Show us the stairway to come back to Earth – sky diver's space jump
Lead those three minutes longin' for love
Peace and light everywhere…
Pick up all the rainbow buds from the sky
All the tries, all the whys
Three minutes to Earth for you and for me

Show us the stairway to come back to Earth – sky diver's space jump
Lead those three minutes longin' for love
Peace and light everywhere…
Show us the stairway to come back to Earth – sky diver's space jump
Dress up the stairway to Earth with no sigh – rock the boat of ragged despair
Pick up all the rainbow buds from the sky
Hear the chime – now's the time:
Three minutes time to Earth for you and me
Take our breath away aѕ we fly…

Anytime, anywhere, we аre going SHIN
