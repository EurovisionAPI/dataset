Did you think that you could get me, boy? (No)
Think again babe
Thought you could buy me for a drink or two
But I'm not that easy

You saw me chatting with my girls at bar (True)
We're all pretty
You told me I look like a movie star (Babe)
I'm not that naive

So I'm gonna make you, make you fall
Down, d-d-down, down on your knees
I'm gonna make you, make you fall
Down, down, down

I'm gonna make you, make you fall
Down, d-d-down, down on your knees
I'm gonna make you, make you fall
Down to get all

Attention
A little care
And you can have love-love-love-love, some love
Attention
A little care
And you can have lots of love

Do you dream about me in your bed?
Keep on dreamin'
You thought I'd give it to you, all I have? (Wait)
Not the first night

You said that it might be the love at first sight
Babe, hold your horses
You told me you're the best I'll ever have
But I just don't believe so

I'm gonna make you, make you fall
Down, d-d-down, down on your knees
I'm gonna make you, make you fall
Down, down, down

I'm gonna make you, make you fall
Down, d-d-down, down on your knees
I'm gonna make you, make you fall
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-down

Attention

No, no, no, no, no
Just behave yourself
Treat me very well
Give me some (Some)
