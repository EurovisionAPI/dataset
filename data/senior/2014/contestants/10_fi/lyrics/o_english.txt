Something Better

Even human bound
People rolling dice
Image on the ground
Such a novel life
He thought
While knowing nothing at all

Every option noted
Or tendency made
They will carry on
Until the perfect day
She said
While knowing nothing at all

All the rules wide known
They mean nothing to mean
Everything I'm used to
Seems to be
Fine misshapen
Made up fantasy
Should let go
Should let go

But we found something better
Plain answer
However
For I'll not
Surrender
We found something better

Vis-a-vis
Estranged
And we got close
Trust full of lies
Sure how it goes
They told
While knowing nothing at all

Talking loud 'bout future
In our hands
Exchanging dreams
And how they'll last
No, no
Still knowing nothing at all

But we found something better
Plain answer
However
For I'll not
Surrender
We found something better

All these words
Reflected back to me
All these words
I'm buying why?
All these words
The live's grand mystery
All these words
A sweet white lie

All these words
She meant to say to me
All these words
Against my faith
All these words
Before she passed away
All these words
We'll never, never, never change

we found something better
Plain аnswer
However
For I'll not
Surrender

We found ѕomething better
We found…
We found..
We found…
We found…
