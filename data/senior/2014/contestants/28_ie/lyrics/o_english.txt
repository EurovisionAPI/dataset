Heartbeat

White lightening upon us again
The wall is now paper thin
And soon the sun's breaking in
Don't you know, know…

How the world is not always true
Still my truth will remain in you
We'll be braver and start anew
I know, know…

Oooh…
When the ocean's way too deep

Keep your head high above the water
We can make it and break the border
Hold on to my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat
Face the danger and face tomorrow
You're a dreamer and you don't know
That no story is carved in stone
Just hold on to my heartbeat
My heartbeat

The ground may be caving in
And some wounds they may never mend
But we'll rise up and try again
I know, know…

Oooh…
When the shore gets hard to see

Keep your head high above the water
We can make it and break the border
Hold on to my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat
Face the danger and face tomorrow
You're a dreamer and you don't know
That no story is carved in stone
Just hold on to my heartbeat
My heartbeat

Keep your head high above the water
We can make it and break the border
Hold on to my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat
Face the danger and face tomorrow
You're a dreamer and you don't know
That no story is carved in stone
Juѕt hold on to my heartbeat
My heartbeаt
