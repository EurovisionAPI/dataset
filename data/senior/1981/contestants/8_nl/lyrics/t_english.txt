It's a wonder

It's a wonder
It's a wonder
Yes, that I've met you
You give my life now a stimulation for good

It's a wonder
It's a wonder
When I think of what you're doing
You give my life new courage
A little glow
A warm tingling in my blood
A love dance
A new chance
It's a wonder

At first being happy didn't mean much to me
I didn't have any experience, on the contrary
Falling down and getting up without comments
And in silence I made both ends meet

It's a wonder
It's a wonder
Yes, that I've met you
You give my life now a stimulation for good

It's a wonder
It's a wonder
When I think of what you're doing
You give my life new courage
A little glow
A warm tingling in my blood
A love dance
A new chance
It's a wonder

Together with you I'm working now on a new beginning
I have my confidence back and a great mind
All the things I do, I do with pleasure
And I save every kiss now as a souvenir

It's a wonder
It's a wonder
Yes, that I've met you
You give my life now a stimulation for good

It's a wonder
It's a wonder
When I think of what you're doing
You give my life new courage
A little glow
A warm tingling in my blood
A love dance
A new chance
It'ѕ а wonder
