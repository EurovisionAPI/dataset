And only you

And only you, and only I
In love on the beach under the sun
There's no one else around
And I draw a heart in the sand
The wind tangles your hair
As if it wants to caress you

And only you, and only I
The blue sky and love in your eyes
Looking at the bewitching sea
We embrace each other with the strength of a cyclone

Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing is the same if you're not here
I'm staying with my loneliness in a corner, whoa...
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing is the same if you're not here
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

And only you, and only I
We know all the secrets of love
And only you, and only I
In our sweet world, happy and dreamy world
In my arms I kiss you
I feel a burning fire on your lips

Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing is the same if you're not here
I'm staying with my loneliness in a corner, whoa...
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing is the same if you're not here
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

And only you, and only I
We know all the secrets of love
And only you, and only I
In our sweet world, happy and dreamy world
In my arms I kiss you
I feel a burning fire on your lips

Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing is the same if you're not here
I'm staying with my loneliness in a corner, whoa...
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing is the same if you're not here
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing is the same if you're not here
I'm staying with my loneliness in a corner, whoa...
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing is the ѕame if you're not here
Whoa, whoa, whoа...
