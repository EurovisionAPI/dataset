When you're here

When you are gone
And though all the birds are singing
When you are gone
And though the flowers are blooming
I'm lonely
And all the people around me are behaving
As if nothing had happened

When you are gone
I don't hear the birds' song
When you are gone
The sun itself shines dimly
Whatever I do, everything is bland and lost
Then I miss you so much

But when you are here
And I breathe close to you
When you are close to me
And I look in the eyes
When you are here
And I take you in my arms
We are forgetting the world around us

When you are here
I see the tree blooming again
When you are here
I see the flowers blooming again
When you are here
I wish so much:
Please never don't go again

When you are gone
I walk around without any aim
Totally lost
I feel hollowed and empty
When you are gone
I have no more plans
Then I miss you so much

But when you are here
And I breathe close to you
When you are close to me
And I look in the eyes
When you are here
And I take you in my arms
We are forgetting the world around us

When you are here
I see the tree blooming again
When you are here
I see the flowers blooming again
When you are here
I wish so much:
Pleaѕe never don't go agаin
