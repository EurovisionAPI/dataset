Lejla

No one will ever love you like I do, never
No one will ever love you like I do, never

We only need a little, you know
Just a little, one more dream
Roses would have bloomed for us
Had you waited for the day with me
If you had only stayed here

But you did not want that
But you did not want that

No one will ever love you like I do, never
No one will ever love you like I do, Lejla

Birds would have led us with songs, you know
The sun would have lit up our path
For our happiness and for you, darling
I have kept all the love
If you had only ѕtayed here

But you did not want that
But you did not want that

No one will ever love you like I do, never
No one will ever love you like I do, Lejla
No one will ever love you like I do, Lejlа
