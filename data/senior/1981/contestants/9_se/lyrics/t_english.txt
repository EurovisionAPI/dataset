Captured in a dream

In my house it happens that the night is long
In my house you can feel something is going on
And when the day turns to dusk, restlessness invites you to dance
You're trying to escape but can't go anywhere

And captured in a dream that doesn't set you free
Captured in a dream, you're held back by your fantasy

Yes, captured once more and if only you could escape
Still captured in a dream, you remain until the day is dawning
In a dream, in a dream

In a time when the world is supposed to be logical
In a time when fairy tales don't fit in
You see reality fall apart with chills in your skin
And though you're screaming out your fear, no sounds are heard

And captured in a dream that doesn't set you free
Captured in a dream, you're held back by your fantasy

Yes, captured once more and if only you could escape
Still captured in a dream, you remain until the day is dawning

Captured in a dream that doesn't set you free
Captured in a dream, you're held back by your fantaѕy
In a dream, in a dream
In a dream, in a dreаm
