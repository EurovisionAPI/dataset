The carousel

Life isn't a game, my friend
Coming to the world has its price
Friendship is eternal, my friend
Love is in the core of man

Life is like a carousel
It also has its ups and downs
Lucky are those who go up my friend
But by those who go down stand true friends

To breathe is not to live
Living is thinking and feeling
Regret the days gone without joy
The carousel goes up and down my friend

Life isn't a game, my friend
Coming to the world has its price
Friendship is eternal, my friend
Love is in the core of man

Life is like a carousel
It also has its ups and downs
Lucky are those who go up my friend
But by those who go down stand true friends

To breathe is not to live
Living is thinking and feeling
Regret the days gone without joy
The carousel goeѕ up аnd down my friend

My friend… my friend…
