Samson

Talks a lot about conquests
About disloyal love
You know what to concoct
For every beautiful woman

Ooh... playboy, I'd rather forget you
Ooh ooh... no one can give you love

Samson, hundreds of stories
Without a Delilah
Samson, forget your wild hairs
Find yourself a Delilah
Samson

You care more about your strange friends
With whom you build castles in the air
With friends you want to find joy
Though I really love you

Ooh... playboy, I want to live with you
Ooh ooh... no one can give you love

Samson, hundreds of stories
Without a Delilah
Samson, forget your wild hairs
Find yourself a Delilah
Sharing your love is too much

I'm your Delilah (If you want to)
I'm longing for you
The true Delilah (If you want to)
Your only wife

Ooh... playboy, I want to live with you
Ooh ooh... no one else can give you love

Samson, hundreds of stories
Without a Delilah
Samson, I take your wild hairs gladly
Gladly along with me

Samson, I love you
