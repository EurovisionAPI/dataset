Humanahum

On a galaxy in the year three thousand
(In the year three thousand)
An old man is sitting on the grey ground
(On the grey ground)
Around him, all the children are gathered
To listen to what he's going to say

Look, my children, over there, in the night
(There, in the night)
This shining ball was full of life
(Full of life)
The men of not long ago were proud of it
And baptized it: the Earth

Humanahum (Humana-huma)
Humanahum (Humana-huma)
Humanahum
Land, Land of Men

There were water and tall trees
(What is a tree?)
And thousands of birds flying over the waves
(What is a wave?)
And a lot of fruits in the valleys and the prairies
And forests could still sing

There were women and girls in flowers
(What is a flower?)
The men had them around their hearts
(What is a heart?)
The women of not long ago were proud of it
Love was fruit of the earth

Humanahum (Humana-huma)
Humanahum (Humana-huma)
Humanahum
Land, Land of Men

And that's that, my friends, the story is finished
(Why finished?)
This shining ball has no more life
(Has no more life)
The men of not long ago were all brotherѕ
But they invented the war

Humanahum (Humana-huma)
Humanahum (Humana-huma)
Humanahum
Land, Land of Men

Humanahum
Humanahum (Humana-huma)
Humanahum
Land, Land of Men
