Summer moon

Summer moon, in your shade I'll wander
In the bewitched starlight, flowers will be kisses
I came standing near you, small ship on the seashore
I tremble the shades of the night, therefore love me, my moon

Summer moon, on the sky of love
The bewitched starlight, flowers make kisses

Look at the desolate seashore, I whisper you "I love you"
Now I'll build a church, for the crazy children of love

Summer moon, on the sky of love
The bewitched starlight, flowers mаke kisseѕ
