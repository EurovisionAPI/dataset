Monica

Years pass by, love and snow
Find us always together
We weathered storms and hard times
But always our love remains

I never remember me being worried because
It was always you
My trusted company, my happy song
My golden love and hope

Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni
Moni, Moni, Monica
You live for me, I live for you
And everything is in harmony

Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni
Moni, Moni, Monica
You live for me, I live for you
And everything is in harmony

I never remember me being worried because
It was always you
My trusted company, my happy song
My golden love and hope

Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni
Moni, Moni, Monica
You live for me, I live for you
And everything is in harmony

Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni
Moni, Moni, Monica
You live for me, I live for you
And everything is in harmony

Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni
Moni, Moni, Monica
You live for me, I live for you
And everything is in harmony

Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni
Moni, Moni, Monica
You live for me, I live for you
And everything iѕ in harmony
