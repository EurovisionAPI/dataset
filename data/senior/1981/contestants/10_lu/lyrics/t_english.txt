It may not be America

It may not be America
But America isn't everything
I've got music in my heart
And this music means a lot to me

It comes from the north of the Provence
As Tramontane or Mistral
It's the fiddle to dance to
Or the choral in the cathedral

It sings during my evening parties
And rocks my nights when I feel a bit down
It's a ballad or a ditty
It's piano, it's guitar

It may not be America
But America isn't everything
I've got music in my heart
And this music means a lot to me

It comes from the depths of my memories,
Even before we were born
It tells us our story
Our roots and our past

If the universe is stormy
If the earth is shaking underneath our feet
We'll go on with our journey
So that it will never stop singing

It may not be America
But America isn't everything
I've got music in my heart
And this music means a lot to me

(It may not be America)
(But America isn't everything)
I've got music in my heart
And this music meanѕ а lot to me
