Tonight

Before we say goodbye
Before the day is gone
Many things will be said between us
A thousand words, a thousand sounds
Until the night

It seems as if it had already happened
It seems as if it had already been
It seems as if they had already been said between us
All of the words, all of the sounds
Night night

What had been, what had been
Been between us
What had been, what had been
That we both had said

All the words, all the sounds
Night night
That we both had said

What had been, what had been
Been between us
What had been, what had been
That we both had said

All of the words, all of the sounds
Night night

Night night, la
Night night, la

Tonight, tonight
It will be the night
We'll say things we've never said before

Tonight (Night night)
Tonight (Day and night)
It will be the night
In which we'll say
Without words, without sounds
We'll say things of love

What had been, what had been
Been between us
What had been, what had been
That we both had said

All of the words, all of the sounds
Night night
Night night, night

(What had been, what had been)
(Been between us)
(What had been, what had been)
(That we both had said)
All the words, all the soundѕ
Night night

Night night, la
Night night, la
Night night, la
Night night, la
Night night, la
Night night, lа
