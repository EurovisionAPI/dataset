Me without you

After the storm, we walk a bit
On the wet sand, we talk a bit
I was wrong, you were wrong
What has been has been
We must not speak about it anymore

Me without you, what shall I do?
I don't breathe if you are not here
Me without you, what shall I be?
A butterfly that doesn't fly anymore

Bring you on the wind like a year ago
The same sentiment, the same intensity
And find words that are never said
While the sun dies in my heart, you'll stay

Me without you, what shall I do
With my life and my days?
Me without you, how shall I do it?
My love, I must invent you

Me without you, what shall I do?
Me without you, how shаll I do it?
My love, I must invent you

My love, I muѕt invent you
