Me without you

Fire, wind and water couldn't frighten me
When I took the long road to my destiny
I was used to losing, now I'm bound to win
'Cause the day I found you made it all begin

Me without you, what would I own?
A dream of flying but wings made of stone
Me without you, oh… what would I do?
I'd take the long road right back to you

Never knew the answer to my world of dreams
Now the explanation lies in you, it seems
Living for tomorrow, far from yesterday
Ever since you told me: "Let me share your way"

Me without you, what would I own?
A dream of flying but wings made of ѕtone
Me without you, oh… what would I do?
I'd take the long road right back to you

Me without you – what would I do? Oh…
Me without you, oh… what would I do?
I'd take the long road right back to you

I'd take the long road right bаck to you
