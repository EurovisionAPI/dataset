Johnny Blue

Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
Everybody is singing your songs
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
And the whole world is listening

He grew up without any friends
Because no one wanted to play
With someone who was blind, like him
And he mostly sat at home
The boys outside
They just shouted after him

They shouted: Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
What colour is the sun?
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
Children can be cruel

On the old guitar
That somebody gave him
He played, it was his friend
His songs, they sounded
Of hope and joy
And sometimes as if someone was crying

And he sang: Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
What colour is the sun?
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
And all the children were listening

And soon nobody could play like him
(Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue)
His songs touched people's hearts
(What colour is the sun?)
And he painted colours with his music
(Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue)
And forgot all his pain

And soon tenthousands came
To his concerts
Because he gave them the power
To believe in the future
In the darkness of life
He had made it himself

Oh Johnny Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
And they all kept coming back
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
Nobody plays as beautifully аs you

Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
Everybody is singing your songs
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
And the whole world is listening

(Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue)
And the whole world is liѕtening
