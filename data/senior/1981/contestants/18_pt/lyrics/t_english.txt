Playback

Maybe you don't know how to sing or even how to whistle
But you won't sing out of tune for sure
In playback, in playback, in playback
You just have to get it right, there's nothing to it
And even without singing, you're going to enchant
In playback, in playback, in playback

Put the microphone in front of you in a very disguisingly way
Smile, so the people won't notice it

In playback, you're someone
Even aphonic, you sing well
In playback, doing playback, long live playback
You'll always sing
In playback, why bother to breathe?
Those who don't know it, won't see it
In playback, doing playback, long live playback
It's for a whole soirée

Maybe you don't know how to sing or even how to whistle
But you won't sing out of tune for sure
In playback, in playback, in playback
You just have to get it right, there's nothing to it
And even without singing, you're going to enchant
In playback, in playback, in playback

Open your mouth, close your mouth, don't make mistakes, don't choke
You're going to be worshipped, pose to delight

Doing playback is what you're good at
Singing without missing the notes
In playback, doing playback, long live playback
You'll always sing
With playback, they even ask for an encore
"But of course", you'll say happily
In playback, doing playback, long live playback
You thank and smile

Maybe you don't know how to sing or even how to whistle
But you won't sing out of tune for sure
In playback, in playback, in playback
You just have to get it right, there's nothing to it
And even without ѕinging, you're going to enchant
In playback, in playback, in playback

In playback, in playback, in playback
In playback, in playback, in playbаck
