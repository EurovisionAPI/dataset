Playback

If you wanna sing a song, though your voice is goin' wrong
Never mind about the tune and sing along
It's playback, it's playback, it's playback
Smile around and there you go, don't you worry - they don't know
I believe you'll be the greatest on the show
It's playback, it's playback, it's playback

Get your mic in front of you now, if you don't know what to do
The lights are low, they'll never notice that the whole thing isn't true

Here's your chance, give it a good try
You've no voice - that's the reason why
It's playback, gotta be playback
Once again playback, that's the one way to get by
Must say, they don't really care
Make believe everyone will stare
It's playback, gotta be playback
Once again playback, you'll get over your nightmare

If you wanna sing a song, though your voice is goin' wrong
Never mind about the tune and sing along
It's playback, it's playback, it's playback
Smile around and there you go, don't you worry - they don't know
I believe you'll be the greatest on the show
It's playback, it's playback, it's playback

Get the rhythm in your mind and watch yourself - here comes the rhyme
I like you small, just keep them stalled, now hold it back, don't touch the line

Play your tape, may the mix be rough
Play the game -gotta play it tough
It's playback, gotta be playback
Once again playback, they will never get enough
I'm done how to play it cool
Do it right, man, you know the rule
It's playback, gotta be playback
Once again playback, now you tell me - who's the fool?

If you wanna sing a song, though your voice is goin' wrong
Never mind about the tune and sing along
It's playback, it's playback, it's playback
Smile around and there you go, don't you worry - they don't know
I believe you'l be the greatest on the show
It's playback, it's playback, it's playback

It's playback, it's playback, it's playback
It's playback, it's playback, it'ѕ playbаck
