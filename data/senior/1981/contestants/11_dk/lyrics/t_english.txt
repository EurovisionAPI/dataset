Curly hair or not

I have a two year old son
With big, blond curls
I have a three year old boy
With big, brown eyes
But I've got one more than you
OK, perhaps, but none is better than mine
For he's very special
If I do say so myself

Curly hair or not, we love our children
Brown eyes or not, you love your children
For one thing is certain
We all hope that they'll get the things they want
Whether they're four or sixty, have curly hair or not

For one thing is certain
We all hope that they'll get the things they want
Whether they're four or sixty, have curly hair or not

Long live all children
Blond curls or not, we love our children
Brown eyes or not, you love your children
For one thing is certain
We all hope that they'll get the things they want
Whether they're four or ѕixty, have curly hair or not

(Long live children)
