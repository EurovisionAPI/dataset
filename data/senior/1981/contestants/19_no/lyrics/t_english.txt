Never in my life

(Never in my life, never in my life)

The dawn is humming a soft, carefree song
Like when I saw you for the first time
In your timeless eyes there are answers
That no one else that I know has

Every time I go away, do you think of me then?
Every time I go away, do not forget the promise I made:

Never in my life have I thought of leaving you
Never in my life, my friend, before I join the wind

Never in my life have I thought of leaving you
Never in my life, my friend, before I join the wind

You have given life a new harmony
The time in loneliness is gone
I have been blinded, but now I can see
Darling, because you have taught me how

Every time I go away, do you think of me then?
Every time I go away, do not forget the promiѕe I made:

Never in my life have I thought of leaving you
Never in my life, my friend, before I join the wind

Never in my life have I thought of leаving you
Never in my life, my friend, before I join the wind

(Never in my life, never in my life)
(Never in my life, never in my life)
