Reggae OK

Here's something for you, maybe strange thing so far
Reggae OK
And even if it's not familiar to everyone, it's playing all the time
Reggae OK
Both rastas and people all around the world
Consider this beat to be their own

And a jerk is the one who says thanks I've had enough
Reggae OK
The rhythm will entrance you, its sound is like a bomb
Reggae OK
You'll learn it easily, as it's as familiar as rhyme
Reggae OK

And if you're interested in what's going on
Enjoy it until you die
And soon you'll say this beat is for me thanks
Reggae OK
Reggae OK, reggae

The rhythm will entrance you, its sound is like a bomb
Reggae OK
You'll learn it easily, as it's as familiar as rhyme
Reggae OK

And if you're interested in what's going on
So enjoy it until you stifle
And soon you'll say this beat is for me thankѕ
Reggae OK, Reggae OK
Reggae OK, Reggаe OK

OK?
