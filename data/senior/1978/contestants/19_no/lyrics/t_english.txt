Mile after mile

Rest now, you are tired
Rest your body, before your power ebbs out
Water is trickling into your shoes
You are walking in the rain

Mile after mile after mile
After mile after mile after mile

Search me if you're longing
Think in a different direction
Come here, where I am, where the sun is near
You can't go

Mile after mile after mile
After mile after mile after mile

And it's far to go
It is your longing that drives you
Towards a light that you see
But I can't

Just think
Where will you end
You have walked too long

Mile after mile after mile
After mile after mile after mile

Juѕt think now
Where are you going
You have walked too long

Mile after mile after mile
After mile after mile after mile
After mile after mile after mile
After mile after mile аfter mile
After mile
