Charlie Chaplin

There he is, coming round the corner
With a small black hat that suits
In our childish anxiety
The police inspector will most likely find him
A red carnation on his lapel
A small cane, suit and ambitious
The packet of cigarettes is empty
And the sky started to rain

Charlie Chaplin, come in our dream to make us laugh
Charlie Chaplin, whatever we see tonight, whatever you come up with
Charlie Chaplin, the dream is silent like your movies
Charlie Chaplin, let's experience your stories again
Charlie Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin

Employers and tough customers
That's the society of Charlo
A life full of illusions
A life with a a warm smile
And the longer the movie lasted
The more it took me away
My God, may the adventure never end
My God, may the ambission never end

Charlie Chaplin, come in our dream to make us laugh
Charlie Chaplin, whatever we see tonight, whatever you come up with
Charlie Chaplin, the dream is silent like your movies
Charlie Chaplin, let's experience your storieѕ again
Charlie Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin, Charlie Chаplin
