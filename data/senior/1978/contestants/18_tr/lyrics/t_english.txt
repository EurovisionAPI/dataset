When I'm in love

All of a sudden the world stops turning, when I love you
All of a sudden the world starts turning, when I love you
Love me all your life, if you love me
When we all love the turning world, it will love us

The sun stops shining when I love you
The sun shines again when I love you
Don't ever stop loving, oh, loving
We all love the nice days, the days love us

Oh… love is such a big country
Oh… love me and run to that country

Don't ever stop loving – oh… loving
We all love the nice days, the days love us

All of a sudden, life is different, when I love you
All of a sudden, the world is different, when I love you
For all the coming years, keep on loving if you love me
When we all love the turning world, it will love us

Oh… love is such a big country
Oh… love me and run to that country

Oh… love is ѕuch a big country
Oh… love me and run to thаt country
