To live

Why not believe in the beautiful story
That makes the hearts and seasons sing?
I want to forget everything in your arms
And start it all again with you
Share the colours and the songs

Why not follow that beautiful story?
Why not smile at the new day?
We will escape my love
And we will find again the song
So that we will live finally in harmony

To live, we will be living a million joys
To pass the hours like free birds
To live, I want to live this musical dream
To steal the stars of love

Why not believe in the beautiful story
That makes the heart and the spring sing?
My life has started with you
The sun rose in happiness
You made me find again my heart of a child

To live, I want to live, this musical dream
To steal the stars of love
To live, we will be living
And turn back the hours
To steal the stars of hаppinesѕ
