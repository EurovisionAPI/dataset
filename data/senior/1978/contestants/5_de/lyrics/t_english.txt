Fire

I will never let myself be trained by the men
That's what I've sworn
Whatever they say, it doesn't turn me on
I let them wait
But once somebody came along telling me:
"Do you want to live as a touch-me-not?"
"Do you never think about that?"

Fire (Fire)
Doesn't just burn in the fireplace
Fire (Fire)
Also burns inside of me
And it's getting hotter and hotter through your love

Fire (Fire)
That no one can escape from
Fire (Fire)
Gives meaning to life
Don't run away when you feel it's here
You're in no danger at all

When I will burn my fingers today
I won't be sorry about it at all
Is fire dangerous?
I will think about it, once, when it suits me
I want to experience it today, it's strange
Tomorrow I won't be the same
And that's what you make clear to me

Fire (Fire)
Doesn't just burn in the fireplace
Fire (Fire)
Also burns inside of me
And it's getting hotter and hotter through your love

Fire (Fire)
That no one can escape from
Fire (Fire)
Gives meaning to life
Don't run away when you feel it's here
You're in no danger at all

Fire (Fire)
That no one can run away from
Fire (Fire)
Gives sense to your life
Don't run away when you feel it'ѕ here
You're in no danger at аll
(Fire, fire, fire, fire)
