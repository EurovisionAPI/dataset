It always gets worse towards the night

The days and the evenings, then I live
I like my job, I have friends to talk to, it's all right
I go out and have a beer and listen to a band
I guess I'll dance, enjoying the warmth of some girl

But it always gets worse towards the night
Far away from all the lights and all the laughter
I lie awake, thinking about you
Remembering too much, feeling lonely

I always come up with something to do, I do as I please
I have nobody to take into consideration and no need to be punctual
I go to the movies, play squash when I feel like it
And I eat late and expensive and tasty
And have a pretty good time in the evening

But it always gets worse towards the night
Far away from all the lights and all the laughter
I lie awake, thinking about you
Remembering too much, feeling lonely

But it always gets worse towards the night
Far away from all the lights and all the laughter
I lie awake, thinking about you
Remembering too much, feeling lonely

But it always gets worse towards the night
Far away from all the lights and all the laughter
But it always gets worse towаrdѕ the night
