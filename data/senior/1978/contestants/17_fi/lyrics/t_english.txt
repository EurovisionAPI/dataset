Give love a chance

Little man you still look with such innocent eyes
Your little feet walk with unsteady steps
But time goes by and a little boy grows into a man
Playing turns into grown-ups' work

I hope that you'll have a big love in your heart then
Because it's easier to go your own way
Sometimes it's difficult to understand the hard world
Remember this, and a new time will begin

Sometimes it's difficult to understand the hard world
Remember this, and a new time will begin

The little hand is still in my hand for a while
The sunniest smile answers to mother's smile
Then I hope that I could stop the time
Soon I'll notice you've become a man

Often in your journey to the adults' hard world
You'll have to take a stand on many ideas and skin colours
But it's most important to give love a chance
Remember this and a new time will begin

Remember thiѕ and а new time will begin
