Boom Boom

What is it that's wrong with me?
I feel a bit unwell
I think it's problems
Or far too much smoke
No, I don't smoke and don't drink at all
Then it's probably your fitness
That's worse than you think

No, I went to see the doctor
And do you know what he said?
That you should stop
The good things in life, from today?
I laid down on the couch, and he examined me
What happened? What did he say?
What's wrong with you?

It's only natural
The heart's pounding away
When you're in love with a girl
If you feel giant beats
You easily get nervous
It's love, that's knocking on the inside

And it goes "boom boom"
And "boom boom" of desire
It feels like thunder here in my breast
Yes, it goes "boom boom"
And beats like possessed
It's pounding and beating day and night

Now I understand
Why you are so pale
I'm pleased, but tell me:
What do you think is on its way?
It's the great love
I know it from myself
So you've felt the way I do
Tell me, tell me, tell me

It's only natural
The heart's pounding away
When you're in love with a girl
If you feel giant beats
You easily get nervous
It's love, that's knocking on the inside

And it goes "boom boom"
And "boom boom" of desire
It feels like thunder here in my breast
Yes, it goes "boom boom"
And beats like possessed
It's pounding and beating day and night

Yes, it goes "boom boom"
And "boom boom" of desire
It feels like thunder here in my breast
Yes, it goes "boom boom"
And beats like possessed
It's pounding and beating day and night

Yes, it goes "boom boom"
And beats like possessed
It'ѕ pounding and beating day аnd night
