This love

This love, I like you till death
This love, come on, let's stop dancing
This love, it's warm here, let's go outside a while

This love, I'm not working tomorrow
Neither do I, your mouth on mine
It's so hard to go away, it started like this
Like this with nothing

The merry-go-round is turning, and my head is dizzy
Tell the whole truth, and don't be scared, no
I bet you really want me
Let's go together, a little more, a little higher

This love, I like you till death
Don't speak, I can't breathe
This love, water splashes on me
It's true, I really want you

This love, your nails, my arms
Your face, your mouth on mine
It's so hard to go away, there's no reason to go away

This love, so many improvised games
Two children would never have been
More close, more impossible thаn uѕ
