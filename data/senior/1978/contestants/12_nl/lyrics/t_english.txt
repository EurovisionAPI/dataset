It's OK

Do you think: I can't take it anymore?
All those problems, every day
Don't you see the sun, but storm and rain?
Is there only bad luck?

Then here's a happy song
The medicine for your problem
Sing it along, then you'll enjoy yourself
Get rid of your sorrows, feel fine

It's okay, sing that melody
Happily and in harmony
Live with some sympathy
For the people around you

It's okay, sing that melody
Happily and in harmony
Strive for some sympathy
Then you're never alone

Don't you have a cent to buy something
Do your dreams never come true?
And do you feel like running away?
Then make a good decision immediately

Look around you,see other people
Look at yourself and see immediately
There's not much to wish for
When you're healthy, you're wealthy

It's okay, sing that melody
Happily and in harmony
Live with some sympathy
For the people around you

It's okay, sing that melody
Happily and in harmony
Strive for some sympathy
Then you're never alone

It's okay, sing that melody
Happily and in harmony
Live with some sympathy
For the people around you

It's okay, sing that melody
Happily and in harmony
Strive for some ѕympathy
Then you're never аlone
