Mrs. Caroline Robinson

Mrs. Caroline Robinson
Only flies with a balloon
Because she's tired of her broom
As top-witch of this town

Mrs. Caroline Robinson
Likes telepathy and television
Sulphur, bang, Chanel and Bach
Fashion makes her weak

If she wants it, everything is still
Only the tower clock ticks
Midnight, the sun laughs
The moon snores without stopping

A miracle has happened
And no one understands
Why, for what, how's that
Today it's witch show

Mrs. Caroline Robinson
Is a sensation for men
Sex appeal instead of the broomstick
Ever since she dropped off her broom

Sulphur, bang, Chanel and Bach

When a dog without a cause
Reads the paper
And studies the women without shame
Believe what you see

A miracle has happened
And no one understands
Why, for what, how's that
Today it's witch show
