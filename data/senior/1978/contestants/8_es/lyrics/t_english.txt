Let's dance a waltz

Oh Michèle, where are you?
I don't know if you remember
The summer we spent together
And which I could never forget

Oh Michèle, I lost you
I've never heard something from you
I just hope that you'll come to me one day
So I can ask you again

Do you want to dance with me? 
Do you want to dance a waltz?
Nana nana nai na nana...
Nana nana nai na nana...

Do you want to dance with me? 
Do you want to dance a waltz?
Nana nana nai na nana...

So I can ask you again

Do you want to dance with me?
