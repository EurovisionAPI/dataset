Do you speak French?

- Wow, hello, my dear
You're looking great, Mayte
How was it: the island, the sea, the beach?
- Hmm… formidable, Maria
Like a dream
Ah, if you had seen it
- Aha, did you understand the importance
Of knowing French?
Tell me
- No
- I beg you, you see?
Oh, I know that, I mean…
- Ah, I see: love?
Ah, a love affair?
- Go on…
- Well, that's it

For hours on the beach, a beautiful afternoon
The sun
- The sun?
- Wakes me up
- Wakes you up?
- What a young man walking by
- A face, no wedding ring?
- His blue, very dangerous eyes
- And then?
- Mmm then?
- Ooh, that man
- Ooh, that man?
- Ooh, he comes to me like a bandit, asking:

Do you speak French?
The language of love and summer
That's an opportunity for a French course
Shame on him who thinks ill of it

He says to me:
Do you speak French?
But tonight, let me invite you
To see the lights in a nice way
To make love in good French

What happiness, without clouds
The true love
When you cry
- Of happiness?
- To embrace
- Delighted
Oh, such time of young madness
- Next year, more than a week
We'll go there together
We'll be…
- It's so beautiful
- We'll be…
- It's so beautiful
- We'll be like the Parisian beauties

We'll say:
Do you speak French?
The language of love and summer
That's an opportunity for a French course
Shame on him who thinks ill of it

We'll say:
Do you speak French?
But tonight, let me invite you
To see the lights in a nice way
To make love in good French
Olé!

We'll say:
