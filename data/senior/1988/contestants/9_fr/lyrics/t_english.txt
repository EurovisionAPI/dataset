Crooner

Need to hear tender songs of a schoolboy
Words dancing on paper
Need to believe all these stories of three times nothing
Which rhyme badly, which do good

Nothing has ever prevented us from setting to music
Those endlessly repeated clichés, romantic feelings

Crooner
It's beautiful, it's great, it's wonderful
Crooner, crooner

Autumn road, summer passions, colours of the weather
The winter sun, the spring rain
The history of men – the kings, the madmen, the conquerors
Were searching for their Sleeping Beauty

Well, pianos, moonlight, walking in prose
And my heart which stupidly proposes on the first page of a paper

Crooner
It's beautiful, it's great, it's wonderful
Crooner that makes lovers love one another

In the uproar of our cities, I make а wiѕh
Crooner, crooner

Crooner, crooner
