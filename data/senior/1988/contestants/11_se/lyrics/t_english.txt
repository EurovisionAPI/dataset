City of light

My journey was towards the sun
Far away from all the closed rooms
Where nothing ever ends
And where there are no borders anymore

I wanted to see the miracle
And hear the words that give birth to life
I want to be carried by a force
Which will grow stronger when I know what I want

The city of light, in a country without a name
Give me life, where everything is born again

And when everything has changed
When time does no longer exist
I can see the two of us together
And then the end of the journey is all we remember

The city of light, in a country without a name
Give me life, where everything is born again

The city of light, in a country without a name
Give… give me life, where everything iѕ born agаin
