Shangri-La

Life
Love
I'm in search of Shangri-la

In a night of neon and the smell of thin beer
There's a folding screen of rice paper standing there
The world is what someone actually wants to see
In a jungle of concrete you almost can't feel love

Who can live without love?
I'm in search of Shangri-la
Who can live without love?
I'm in search of Shangri-la

Yes, just live by feel
Your days are aimless
Until tomorrow's over again

Along every block of flats
I see a bamboo rope
Life without love
I'm in search of Shangri-la

Yes, just live by feel
Your dreams are aimless
Until tomorrow's over again

Life
Love
I'm in search of Shangri-la

Life
Love
I'm in search of Shangri-la
I'm in ѕearch of Shangri-lа
