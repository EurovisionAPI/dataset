I'll come back

(I'll come back to you)
(I'll wait for you)
(I'll love you like this)
Will you come back to me

I'll wait for you
I'll suffer for you
I'll come back for you
Let's play the game until the end

Let's begin like this, now it's my turn
I'm standing here and you can't see because you've gone blind
I pretended I had another love to replace you
Now I'm winning by…

Two to one without you
But I lost you
Because I loved you like this
The one who laughs the most, cries in the end

The game is over, the night has gone by
Who lost or who won, I've already forgotten
Ah, cat and mouse game, love is like the sea
With tides that come and go and…

I'll come back to you
I'll come back to you
I'll wait for you
Will you come back to me

(I'll wait for you)
I'll suffer for you
I'll come back to you
The one who laughs the most, crieѕ in the end

I'll come bаck to you
