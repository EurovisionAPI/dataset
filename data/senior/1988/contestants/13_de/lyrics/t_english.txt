Song for a friend

This is a song for you, just listen to it
Because this melody is just like you
Listen

Honest and plainspoken, tender and clever
Happy and quiet and at the same time and strong enough

Because that's the way you are, like this song for a friend
A song like you, like the way you live and dream
When you hear it somewhere
I miss you so

Friends never go too early, they never disappoint you
Friends will stay when no one else remains
Share your luck and also your pain

This song is for you, it's not very much
But when this song is over, a feeling remains

Because that's the way you are, like this song for a friend
A song like you, like the way you live and dream
When you heаr it somewhere
I miss you ѕo
