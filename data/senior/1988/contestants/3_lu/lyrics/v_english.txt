Trust

No, there is no time
To just moan and cry
For you feel the world's so unjust
Take the time to open your hearts and eyes
Know in mankind you can trust

Trust in those who strive for a brand new day
Trust in me come on take my hand
Trust with harmony
That we change bad ways
Trust in the goodness of man

Trust like the new bird
That takes to flight
Trust in the child daily struggling for life
Trust if lost, you will find his light
Trust the rainbow's there insight

Trust like you did when you were so young
Trust that with real love
We can build as one
Trust stand up, say it with song

Then peаce will shine like the ѕun
