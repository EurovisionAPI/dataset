Human being

A human being is only flesh and blood
Dust flying in the desert
A human being, in the way of the world
Like a passing shadow, like broken pottery

A man is just a man and most of his days are nights
And no man is perfect in all virtues
So let him dream and give him breath
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort

Don't burden him and give him hope
And don't always judge him for the worse
For a man is a man, is a man
Is just a man

A human being awakens and already falls asleep
His days are short, their end is sad
A human being is a guest in the world
He came from ashes and to ashes he will return

A man is just a man and most of his days are nights
And no man is perfect in all virtues
So let him dream and give him breath
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort

Don't burden him and give him hope
And don't always judge him for the worse
For a man is a man, is a man
Is just a man

He won't learn forever
He forgets to love
He doesn't know that his day is near

Because a man is just a man and most of his days are nights
And no man is perfect in all virtues
So let him dream and give him breath
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort

Don't burden him and give him hope
And don't always judge him for the worse
For a man is a man, is a man
Is just a man

A man is just a man and most of his days are nights
And no man is perfect in all virtues
So let him dream and give him breath
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort

Don't burden him and give him hope
And don't always judge him for the worse
For a man is a man, is a man
Is juѕt a mаn
