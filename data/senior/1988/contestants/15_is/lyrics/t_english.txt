Socrates

I admire Debussy, I worship Tschaikovsky
And Einar Ben and Beethoven and Gunnar Thoroddsen

I worship Harold Lloyd, I worship Sigmund Freud
And John Wayne and Mark Twain and you and Michael Caine

Let's all sing about Socrates, the Hercules of the soul
And about all of those who are desired by all
And who everyone worships and admires

I sing about Columbus and Solon Islandus
And Mendelssohn and Paul and John
And Jón Páll Sigmarsson

Let's all sing about Socrates, the Hercules of the soul
And about all of those who are desired by all
And who everyone worships and admires

Hey… let's all sing about Socrates, the Hercules of the soul
And the prophets but particularly those
Who are no longer here among us

Lalalala lalala… lalalala lalala…
Lalalala… lalalala…
Lalala lalala…
