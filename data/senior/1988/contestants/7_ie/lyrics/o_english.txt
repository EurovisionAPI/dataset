Take Him Home

So much to do, so little time
You ask me, can I change the world?
And then, for everybody's sake
What are the changes I would make?
And you can dream, dream on, my friend
You have the right
There is something we can do
Something we can do, it's so easy

If I light a candle for everybody I know
I could see forever down that long, long road

So if you meet somebody, it might be someone I know
Brother, if he needs you, take him home

You can look him in the eye and hold out your hand
Tell him you're a brother and he'll understand

So if you meet somebody, it might be someone I know
Brother, if he needs you…
Brother, if he needs you, take him home

So if you meet somebody, it might be someone I know
Brother, if he needs you…
Brother, if he needs you…
Brother, if he needs you, take him home

Brother, if he needѕ you, tаke him home
