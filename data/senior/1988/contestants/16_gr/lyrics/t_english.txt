Clown

A circus sells joy again in the night
And as a first act the clown portrays life
Crews, noise, everyone here lives in a fever of activity
Lights and music, time becomes just a moment

Clown, Clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown
Ha ha ha ha…

Clown, Clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown
Ha ha ha ha…

I sing, laugh, cry and babble
I do somersaults, I imitate you if you like
People laugh at everything I do, they all applaud me
But even the children know, that I have a heart

Clown, Clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown
Ha ha ha ha…

Clown, Clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown
Ha ha ha ha…

And when there will come a time that I'll be without an audience
I'll always laugh, crying I'll ѕing

Clown, Clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown
Ha ha ha ha…

Clown, Clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown
Ha ha ha hа…
