Laughing eyes are remembered

On a day like any other
Amongst so many other people, it's easy to walk alone
And just meet empty human shells
With strange expressions, cold looks
Some even totally expressionless people
Are walking, looking, hardly hearing at all

Let's step out of the shell to a new world
Let's open our ears to hear things, and just bravely relax
Let's get rid of unnecessary tension and let's laugh
The laughing eyes are remembered
The ones that are full of expression are noticed

People in their shells, old and young, are sometimes all alone
Everyone could feel better if they had a friend
With funny expressions, tender looks, a breath of new life
Are looking, hearing and laughing with joy

Let's step out of the shell to a new world
Let's open our ears to hear things, and just bravely relax
Let's get rid of unnecessary tension and let's laugh
The laughing eyes are remembered
The ones that are full of expression are noticed

Let's step out of the shell to a new world
Let's open our ears to hear things, and just bravely relax
Let's get rid of unnecessary tension and let's laugh
The laughing eyes are remembered
The ones that are full of expresѕion аre noticed
