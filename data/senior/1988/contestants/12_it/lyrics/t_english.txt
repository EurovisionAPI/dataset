I write you

Sorry if I write you
But you know with words
You can't always
Say what you really want

It could be shyness
Or fear of hearing
What too easily
Makes us suffer

Sorry if I write you
It's a long time since we've talked
Because we didn't want to run the risk
Of hurting each other

Who knows for how many times
Without even realising it
We've walked
A few meters away from each other

Sorry if I write you
But now what remains
Are some memories
A picture with your name

Written on the snow
While you're looking into the lens
And your eyes are smiling at me
And you make me feel alive
Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive
Also without you
I'll find a reason
To keep on living
Living

Sorry if I write you
But you know there's no poetry
Saying that I love you
On your answering machine

Probably I'm out
But what I feel in my heart
I don't want on a tape
Where it can be removed from

Sorry if I write you
But tell me what is left
Of speaking about memories
And of playing with your name

It's written on a wall
Without a good reason
I just scream out your name
It makes me feel alive
Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive
Also without you
I'll find a reаѕon
To keep on living
Living, living
