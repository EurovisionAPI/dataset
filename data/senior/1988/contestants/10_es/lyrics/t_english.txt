The girl that I want (Made in Spain)

Where is, to the south of parallel forty-three
The craziest and coldest girl?
What does she have, that bothers everyone who sees her
Changing them with her philosophy?

'Made in Spain' tattooed on her skin
A hundred thousand watts of sun shining on me everyday
Made in Spain, special passport
She's made in Spain, the best guarantee

But I feel bad in the hours of abstinence
They're all so cold
And finally she wins with her natural vein
If I feel bad, she gives me energy

Her feminine loose hair, her confidential heart
Her eyes looking in stereo
Who is she? Nobody knows
The girl that I love, I want a 'made in Spain'

'Made in Spain' tattooed on her skin
A hundred thousand watts of sun shining on me everyday
Made in Spain, special passport
She's made in Spain , the best guarantee

(Made in Spain, ah…)
Who is she? Nobody knows
The girl that I love, I want a 'made in Spain'

'Made in Spain' tattooed on her skin
A hundred thousand watts of sun shining on me everyday
Made in Spain , special passport
She's made in Spain , the beѕt guarantee

Made in Spain, Made in Spain, Made in Spаin
