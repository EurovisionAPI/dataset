Rascal

I'm following you for days, know all about you
You walk beside me and don't even look at me
And I'd give it all, all my years
To have you touch me, hug me for a moment

And you are a rascal, a big rascal
You don't want a child like me
Because you are a rascal, a big rascal
You don't want a child like me

Because you are a rascal, a big rascal
You don't want a child like me
Because you are a rascal, a big rascal
You don't want a child like me
Whoa…

I'm following you for days, you're right in front of me
You walk straight through me as if I don't exist
And I'd give it all, all my years
To have you touch me, hug me for a moment

And you are a rascal, a big rascal
You don't want a child like me
Because you are a rascal, a big rascal
You don't want a child like me

You are really a rascal, a big rascal
You don't want a child like me
Because you are a rascal, a big rascal
You don't want a child like me

Because you are a rascal, a big raѕcal
You don't want a child like me
