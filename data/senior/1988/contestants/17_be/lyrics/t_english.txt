Let the sun shine

Ooh... billions of humans on earth
Search the light
To burn fierce fires

Ooh... their ideas, which are murdered
In camps, in mines
To imprison the sun

Ooh... I know that it hurts
Ooh... you see everything isn't normal

Ooh... in the streets and in the stations
The bottom of despair
Of those who are cold in the winter

Ooh... and all those toddlers that are mutilated
For begging the useless
What do they think of the sun?

Ooh... I know that it hurts
Ooh... you see everything isn't normal

Ooh... what will we do with the earth
When only stones are left
To be launched into the universe?

Ooh... if our fatal madness
Could finally be kept silent
Let the sun shine

Whoа... the sun
Let the sun shine
(Yes, the sun)
Let the sun shine
(Yes, the sun)
Let the sun ѕhine
