Lisa, Mona Lisa

She sleeps during the day and dances at night
I hear her crying when she laughs
And she laughs again and again

She sees clearly at night and needs no light
She paints fairy tales on her face
And she laughs me down

Sometime I learn to see her
Sometime I begin
Can I look behind her colours?

(Lisa, Mona Lisa)
(Lisa, Mona Lisa)

She's lying but no liar
She carries her life in her face, and she lives

Somehow it's very difficult to see her
Somehow I'm glad
To sometimes understand her dreams

Lisa, Mona Lisa
Lisa, Mona Lisa

Lisa, Mona Lisa
Lisa, Mona Lisa

She's tumbling through the glittering town
Searching for someone, who has a smile for her
Somehow

Somehow I like her
And somehow I love her
And somehow I will understand her

Whoa...
Lisa, Mona Lisa
Lisa, Mona Lisa

Lisa, Mona Lisa
Lisa, Mona Lisa

Lisa, oh Mona Lisa
Lisa, (Mona Liѕа)
