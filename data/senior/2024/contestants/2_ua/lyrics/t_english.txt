Teresa & Maria

Spri-spri-spring
Carves its way
No matter what
The world is on her shoulders

Pa-pa-path
Is winding and rocky
But you should know: your own happiness
Is in your hands

Come on, little girl, light up
I'm not holy, I'm alive

Mother Teresa and Diva Maria are with us
Barefoot, as if on a blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the Divas were born as human beings

Mother Teresa and Diva Maria are with us
Barefoot, as if on a blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the Divas were born as human beings

Even when we were little, we searched for a path
And life is a loop, as if for those who are falling
On her shoulders, still a young girl
She carries a burden of pain, seeing it as a flaw
Again not as she should be, or too tender
Clothes on her bones, naked or going down the aisle
Where is your child? What is your life?
But the years are flying! You should be aware: the end is near
And may someone want us to break
May there be energy in you
Not the elbow-deep, but the finger-deep
And may someone hide hatred
And envy behind a smile
When you let anger into your heart
Instead of kindness and love
But there are saints in the sky
Their feet have seen this earth, you know
That's why your thorny
Path is not in vain
And though it may be very scary and dark
And sometimes not easy
But you'll always have your ancestors
Following you from heaven

Mother Teresa and Diva Maria are with us
Barefoot, as if on a blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the Divas were born as human beings

Mother Teresa and Diva Maria are with us
Barefoot, as if on a blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the Divas were born as humаn beingѕ
