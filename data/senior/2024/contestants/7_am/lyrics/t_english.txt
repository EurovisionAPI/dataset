Jako

La la la…

They tell me: "Jako, be humble
Don't talk too much
Don't stay too quiet
Wear this, open this, close that
Behave like a girl!"
But I am a free girl
So I will dance and you will watch

La la la…

Come, come, come and join me
No matter what they ѕay
We will forget about the time again
Come on, come on, come on my dear
Get up and dance

La la lа…
