Hurricane

Writer of my symphony
Play with me
Look into my eyes and see
People walk away but never say goodbye

Someone stole the moon tonight
Took my light
Everything is black and white
Who's the fool who told you boys don't cry?

Hours and hours, empowers
Life is no game but it's ours
While the time goes wild

Everyday I'm losing my mind
Holding on in this mysterious ride
Dancing in the storm
I got nothing to hide
Take it all and leave the world behind

Baby promise me you'll hold me again
I'm still broken from this hurricane
This hurricane

Living in a fantasy, ecstasy
Everything is meant to be
We shall pass but love will never die

Hours and hours, empowers
Life is no game but it's ours
While the time goes wild

Everyday I'm losing my mind
Holding on in this mysterious ride
Dancing in the storm
I got nothing to hide
Take it all and leave the world behind

Baby promise me you'll hold me again
I'm still broken from this hurricane
This hurricane

This hurricane
