October Rain

Writers of the history
Stand with me
Look into my eyes and see
People go away but never say goodbye

Someone stole the moon tonight
Took my light
Everything is black and white
Who's the fool who told you boys don't cry

Hours and hours and flowers
Life is no game for the cowards
Why does time go wild

Every day I'm loosing my mind
Holding on in this mysterious ride
Dancing in the storm
We got nothing to hide
Take me home and leave the world behind

And I promise you that never again
I'm still wet from this october rain
October Rain

Living in a fantasy, ecstasy
Everything's meant to be
We shall pass but love will never die

Hours and hours and flowers
Life is no game for the cowards
Why does time go wild

Every day I'm loosing my mind
Holding on in this mysterious ride
Dancing in the storm
We got nothing to hide
Take me home and leave the world behind

And I promise you that never again
I'm still wet from this october rain
October Rain

October Rain

There's no air left to breath
There's no space
I'm gone day by dаy
Everyone is good kidѕ
One by one
