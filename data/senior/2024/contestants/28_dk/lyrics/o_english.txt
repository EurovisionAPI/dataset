Sand

(Uh uhh…)
Yesterday is eating up my mind
You and me we couldn't get it right
We were throwing memories in the air
Bits and pieces lying everywhere

(Uh uhh…)
Bits and pieces lying everywhere
(Uh uhh…)
Bits and pieces like we didn't care

Shouldn't be so hard
Like breathing under water
Baby, we've been in the blue
Didn't see it coming
Falling into nothing
Ain't there something we can do

(Uh uhh…)
I can feel you slipping through my hands
(Uh uhh…)
Guess we built a castle out of sand

Yesterday I had you by my side
Now we're just like strangers in the night
Pictures of us lying on the floor
No, I can't do this fighting anymore

But it shouldn't be so hard
Like breathing under water
Baby, we've been in the blue
Didn't see it coming
Falling into nothing
Ain't there something we can do

(Uh uhh…)
I can feel you slipping through my hands
(Uh uhh…)
Guess we built a castle out of sand

Sand, sand
I can feel you slipping through my hands
Sand, sand
Guess we built a castle out of sand

Shouldn't be so hard
Like breathing under water
Shouldn't be so hard
Like breathing under water

Sand, sand
I can feel you slipping through my hands
Sand, sand
Guess we built a castle out of ѕаnd
