Europapa

Europe, let's come together
(Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa)
It's now or never
I love you all
(Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa)

Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa
Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

Visit my friends in France
Or take a long walk to Vienna
I want to leave the Netherlands
But my passport is gone
Fortunately don't need a visa to be with you
So take the bus to Poland or the train to Berlin
I have no money for Paris so use my imagination
Do you have a euro please? Say "merci" and "please"

I lost everything except time
So am travelling every day for the world is mine

Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa
Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

Euro-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Euro-pa-pa-pa (hey)
Euro-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Eu-ro-pa (hey)

I'm in Germany but I'm so alone
I am in Italy but still I feel pain
Am running from myself
Calling for "help" all day long
Yes I even give people money, but there is no one to help me
I don't need es-car-gots, don't need fish 'n chips
Don't need paella, no
I don't even really know what that is

Turn on the radio, I hear Stromae with "Papaoutai"
Won't stop until they say, "Yes, yes, he does that very well ey!"

Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa
Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

Euro-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Euro-pa-pa-pa (hey)
Euro-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Eu-ro-pa (hey)

(Euro-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa…)
<i style="color:#789">I don't care who you are
I don't care where you come from
All we got is this moment
So let's come together</i>
(Welcome to Europe, boy)

(Hey)
Eu-ro-pa

<i style="color:#789">At the end of the day
We are all human beings
My father told me once
That the world has no borders</i>

<i style="color:#789">I miss you every day
Is what I whisper to myself
You see, dаd
I did liѕten to you</i>
