Vixen

(Vixen, vixen…)

I know I'm just a vixen to you
My past is gobbling you up
I know I'm the black sheep
The misunderstood, the one made of stone

I know I'm not who you want me to be
(I know)
I get it, it's driving you up the wall
(I know)
But this is just my nature
Can't be bothered changing for you

I'm in a good place now
It was just a matter of time
I'm gonna hit the streets and shout out what I feel
From the rooftops

If I head out solo, I'm a bit of a vixen
If I'm having fun, I'm the biggest vixen
If I stretch the night till it's daylight
I'm an even bigger vixen

When I get what I want
(Vixen, vixen)
It's never 'cause I deserve it
(Vixen, vixen)
Even though I'm taking on the world
No one appreciates it at all

I'm in a good place now
It was just a matter of time
I'm gonna hit the streets and shout out what I feel
From the rooftops

I'm in a good place now
(Vixen, vixen)
Rebuilt from the inside out
(Vixen, vixen)
And that vixen you were so scared of, she's been empowering herself
And now she's a picture-perfect vixen

(Vixen, vixen, vixen)
Who's not doing so badly
(Vixen, vixen, vixen)
And couldn't care less about anything
Go ahead, throw stones, if that's your thing
I'm a picture-perfect vixen

I'm a real woman
(Vixen, vixen, vixen)
And if I get all worked up
(Vixen, vixen, vixen)
From vixen, I might just turn into a jackal
If so, you're in trouble
I'm a picture-perfect vixen
(Vixen, vixen)

I'm in a good place now
Just a matter of time
I'm gonna hit the streets and shout out what I feel
From the rooftops

I'm in a good place now
(Vixen, vixen, vixen)
Rebuilt from the inside out
(Vixen, vixen, vixen)
And that vixen you were so scared of, she's been empowering herself
And now she'ѕ а picture-perfect vixen
