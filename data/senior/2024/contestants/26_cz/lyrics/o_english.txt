Pedestal

Your sorry means nothing when everything else
Stays the same, stays the same
You stay silent, I get violent
And everything else stays the same
Pathetic and I'm over it
You're so full of it, full of it
I'll give all the love to me
And then I'll truly be free, I'll truly be free

And I, I, I, I need to learn to
I, I, I, I need to learn to
Put myself on a pedestal

I will be loving me more, loving me
(Put myself on a pedestal)
I will be loving me more
I finally learned not to force things
And I love me more, love me more, love me more
Love me more than you once did
(Put myself on a pedestal)
I will be loving me more (loving me more)

Love of your life, just please don't ask
For any action or any proof
Oh the irony - where did my pride go?
I feel no shame, but you should and now I know

I, I, I, I need to learn to
I, I, I, I need to learn to
Put myself on a pedestal

I will be loving me more, loving me
(Put myself on a pedestal)
I will be loving me more
I finally learned not to force things
And I love me more, love me more, love me more
Love me more than you once did
(Put myself on a pedestal)
I will be loving me more (loving me more)

<i style="color:#789">I told you like a million times, why do you keep doing the ѕame thing?
- I'm not doing it, I'm not doing it, I told you…
You are! Stop, where аre you going?
- I'm not doing it, I'm off</i>

I will be loving me more
Loving me, loving me, loving me, loving me
Loving me, loving me
I will be loving me more
Loving me more
Loving me, loving me, loving me, loving me
