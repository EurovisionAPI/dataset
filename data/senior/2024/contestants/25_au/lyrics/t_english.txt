One Blood

I stand in the eye of the spiral
One of them billion-iIlions, billion-iIlions
My soul slips away from its title
One of them billion-iIlions
And I descend to the centre of the earth

I may be dreaming
But the atoms are awake
Spill the tea on reality
And the 0.618

What ya gonna do in the real world Mickey?
What ya gonna do when you see?
Blood (one blood)
Blood
Escape with us to the planets
To the Fleetwood Macs and the Janets
Blood
While entertaining the Gods

One Blood , blood
It's raining love
One blood, blood

We're on a gravitron
As it tangles
With them billion-iIlions
Of our souls and Angels
We kiss and matter dismantles

To see we don't own the universe
Feel the borders blur
We belong to her
I may be dreaming
But the atoms are awake
Spill the tea on reality
And the 0.618

What ya gonna do in the real world Mickey?
What ya gonna do when you see?
Blood (one blood)
Blood
Escape with us to the planets
To the Fleetwood Macs and the Janets
Blood

While entertaining the Gods
(One blood, blood)
It's raining love
(One blood, blood)

While entertaining the Gods
One blood, blood
It's raining love
One blood, blood

Blood (one blood)
Blood (one blood)
Blood
One blood

It'ѕ rаining love
(Blood, one blood, blood)
One blood
