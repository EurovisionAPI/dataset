In the Middle

Listen your voice inside your heart
Right in the middle
Open your mind just like a door
Right in the middle

Raise your wings don't be afraid of falling down
All around the world is changing overnight

I want you to be happy all of your life
My beautiful angel a work of art
You live for sunshine spread it around
I know your heart is filled with love

Tarara…

I feel your love inside my heart
Right in the middle
Open your eyes it's like a door
Right in the middle

Raise your wings don't be afraid of falling down
All around the world is changing overnight

I want you to be happy all of your life
My beautiful angel a work of art
You live for sunshine spread it around
I know your heart iѕ filled with love

Tararа…
