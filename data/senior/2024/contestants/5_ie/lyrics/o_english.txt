Doomsday Blue

Avada Kadavra, I speak to destroy
The feelings I have I cannot avoid
Through twisted tongues a hex deployed on you
That all the pretties in your bed escape your hands and make you sad
And all the things you wish you had, you lose

I, I, I know you're living a lie
I, I, I see the scars in your eyes
I, I, I know you're living a lie
I, I

I guess you'd rather have a star than the moon
I guess I always overestimate you
Hoodoo all the things that you do
I'm down, down in my doomsday blue

I, I, I know you're living a lie
I, I, I know you're living a lie

Avada Kadavra, the thoughts in my head
The places I touch when lying in bed
The visions of you the words that you said, undo
My heartbeat buried in the ground and to the strings I bind you're bound
So when you sleep you'll hear my sound

I, I, I know you're living a lie
I, I, I see the scars in your eyes
I, I, I know you're living a lie
I, I

I guess you'd rather have a star than the moon
I guess I always overestimate you
Hoodoo all the things that you do
I'm down, down in my doomsday blue
I guess you'd rather have a star than the moon
I guess I always overestimate you
Hoodoo all the things that you do
I'm down, down in my doomsday blue

For your romance I'd beg, steal and borrow
It's draining me hollow, you
You could slow dance me out of my sorrow
But your favourite colour compared to the others is doom
Doomsday blue
