No Rules!

Welcome
My name is Windows, Windows95man
And I only live by one rule
And the rule is no rules
(No rules)

Silence, I say
This is my time, my stage
Call me what you may, see if I care, see me slay
Is there something wrong with the way I look?
Is there something wrong with who I am?
If I'm not alright, tell me why do I feel so beautiful tonight

No rules
It's how I live, how I find the wind beneath my wings
It's how I learn to fly
(Let's go)
No rules
In the heat of the night, in the thrill of the fight
I don't even care what's wrong or right
It's how I live my life
No rules

Quiet as I speak
I am the king, I am the queen
And you all gonna be free
Forget the rules and scream
Is there something wrong with the way I look?
Is there something wrong with who I am?
If I'm not alright, tell me why do I feel so beautiful tonight

(Move your body)
No rules
It's how I live, how I find the wind beneath my wings
It's how I learn to fly
(Come to me)
No rules
In the heat of the night, in the thrill of the fight
I don't even care what's wrong or right
It's how I live my life

(No rules)
It's how I live, how I find the wind beneath my wings
It's how I learn to fly
(Make some noise, let's go)
In the heat of the night, in the thrill of the fight
I don't even care what's wrong or right
It's how I live my life

No rules
It's how I live, how I find the wind beneath my wings
It's how I learn to fly
(Come on)
No rules
In the heat of the night, in the thrill of the fight
I don't even care whаt's wrong or right
It's how I live my life

No ruleѕ
