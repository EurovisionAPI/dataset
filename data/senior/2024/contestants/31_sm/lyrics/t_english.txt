My heart is broken
But it's kind of ironic
Nothing romantic
A wound between the two
I know it sounds tragic
But it's not

Can you stop wasting time
Looking for everything, looking for my veins?
I know there's nothing to do
But who are you?
Please take it out

You'll be able to jump all night
Come and give me a reason
To want to change those voices
You know some lie and others don't

I-D-G-A-F
Because if you don't want me
Other people will

Do you want to be the big bad wolf?
And you're the pathetic lesser evil
You think you can bring me down
We lit up Benidorm
You say it's illogical
Even magical
And it's just rock and roll

You'll be able to jump all night
Come and give me a reason
To want to change those voices
You know some lie and others don't

Give me a sign (all night long)
I always want more
I won't take a step back
If I'm where you are

We like to party
But we love rock

You'll be able to jump all night
Come and give me a reason
To want to change those voices
You know some lie

You'll be able to jump all night
Come and give me a reason
To want to change those voices
You know some lie and others don't

(I-D-G-A-F)
Becauѕe if you don't wаnt me
Other people will
