Loop

Don't you know that you got me
That you got me
Yeah, me, yeah

Got me so hot, burning up like a fever
I'm a honeypot, never tasted nothing sweeter
Thought you could turn me down, no, no, no
Let's go another round, slow-oh-oh

Don't you tell me I'm your addiction
It was obvious you'd end up like this

Oh my god, you got-got-got me on (loop)
'Cause I'm in, but the bla-bla-blame is on (you)
Let me tease you, boy, you love it when I 
M-m-m-move, got you on loop
In your head all night
You got me on
Got me on
Got me on
Loop

Cherry on top, you're the cinnamon
Making my heart skip a little bit
Like ra-pa-pa-bam-ba, ra-pa-pa-bam-ba, yeah
You know how to spin me, boy

Don't you know you're my, my addiction
It was obvious we'd end up like this

Oh my god, you got-got-got me on (loop)
'Cause I'm in, but the bla-bla-blame is on (you)
Let me tease you, boy, you love it when I
M-m-m-move, got you on loop
In your head all night
You got me on
Got me on
Got me on
Loop

It was obvious, we're addicted, addicted
Yeah, it was obvious
Here we go again

Oh my god, you got-got-got me on (loop)
'Cause I'm in, but the bla-bla-blame is on (you)
Let me teaѕe you, boy, you love it when I
M-m-m-move, got you on loop
In your head аll night
You got me on
Got me on
Got me on
