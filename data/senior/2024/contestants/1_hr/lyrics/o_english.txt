Rim Tim Tagi Dim

Ay, I'm a big boy now
I'm ready to leave, ciao, mama, ciao
Ay, I'm a big boy now
I'm going away and I sold my cow
Before I leave, I must confess
I need a round of decompress
One more time for all the good times

Gonna miss you all but mostly the cat
Gonna miss my hay, gonna miss my bed
Most of all, I'ma miss the dance
So come on y'all, let us prance

Now don't call, don't write
I'm leavin' with the first light
Don't cry, but dance

There's no going back
My presence fades to black
Yeah, there's no going back
My anxiety attacks

I hope I find peace in the noise
Wanna become one of them city boys
They're all so pretty and so advanced
Maybe they also know our dance

Bye mom, bye dad
Meow, cat, please meow back
Don't cry, just dance
