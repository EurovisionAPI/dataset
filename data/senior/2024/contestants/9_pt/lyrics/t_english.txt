Scream

I heard it, I felt
My body carrying me
We keep going
One and the other
One and the other
One and the other

I'm free falling
I'll let you know when I get there
I surrender myself
Little by little

Long strides, stuck in the starting line
I want to let go of what hurt me
I ask the morning star to make the day
Rise again

I've transformed every verse within me
And given in to the courage
That still burns
Still burns
Beats the light in my chest and opens
I'm a flame that still burns
Still burns
Still burns

Today I want to prove to myself
That I can be whatever I want
Gather those who love me around a table
Forgive those who wanted to see me suffer
I can't be fooled (No!)
I am whole
I still remember when I was little
I dreamed first

Long strides, stuck in the starting line
I want to let go of what hurt me
I ask the morning star to make the day
Rise again

I've transformed every verse within me
And given in to the courage
That still burns
Still burns
Beats the light in my chest and opens
I'm a flame that still burns
Still burns
Still burns

I'm a flame that still burns
Still burns
I'm a flame that still burns
Still burns
It burns
It burns
It burns

I've transformed every verse within me
And given in to the courage
That still burns
Still burns
Beats the light in my chest and opens
I'm a flame thаt still burns
Still burns
Still burnѕ
