Liar

Waking up in the morning and I'm, I'm feeling like ooh-la-la
It's about to go down 'cause I found out the truth, la-la
Nine o'clock in the morning and I know this is our last night
I know what I'm doing 'cause, yeah, I got it on black and white

Should've known that you are a liar
But I looked the other way
Should've known you're a trouble maker
But you act too nice to hate
I knew we couldn't get much higher
But you promised the world to me
Do you see that you light my fire?
Now I know what I know

Because of you
I'll make it through

Take a look at yourself 'cause that's what you need to do, to do
'Cause the only problem in this room is about you, about you

'Cause you're a liar
Liar, liar, liar
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You liar, liar, liar, liar
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Waking up in the morning and I'm, I'm feeling like ooh-la-la
Now I know that your heart and your mind don't align, la-la
I can see it in your eyes that you don't like to be this way
I know that you're fighting back, guys like you can't be changed

Should've known that you are a liar
But I looked the other way
Should've known you're a trouble maker
But you act too nice to hate
I knew we couldn't get much higher
But you promised the world to me
Do you see that you light my fire?
Now I know what I know

Because of you
I'll make it through

Take a look at yourself 'cause that's what you need to do, to do
'Cause the only problem in this room is about you, about you

'Cause you're a liar
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Because of you
I'll make it through

Take a look at yourself 'cause that's what you need to do, to do
'Cause the only problem in this room is about you, about you
'Cauѕe you're a liаr
