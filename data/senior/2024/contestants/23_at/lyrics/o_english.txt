We Will Rave

Ice running through my veins
You just did it again
Go, 'cause I can't be your friend
I'm cold, but this is not the end

So I go, go, go
Where the broken hearted go
No one knows a thing about my haunted soul
I go oh oh
Wanna dance it off alone
I won't let it show
They will never know

When the darkness hits, and we can't be saved
We rum de dum dum da
We will rave
When our hearts are burning, we feel no pain
We rum de dum dum da
We will rave

We rum de dum dum da
We rum de dum dum da (we will rave)
We rum de dum dum da (we will rave)
(We will rave)
(Rave, rave ra-a-a-a-a)

We will rave

I see only silhouettes
I just wanna forget
About everything we said
And the demons in my head

So I go, go, go
Where the broken hearted go
No one knows a thing about my haunted soul
I go oh oh
Wanna dance it off alone
I won't let it show
They will never know

When the darkness hits, and we can't be saved
We rum de dum dum da
We will rave
When our hearts are burning, we feel no pain
We rum de dum dum da
We will rave
We rum de dum dum da (we will rave)

We will rave
We will rave

(Rave, rave, rave)
We will rave
(Rave, rave, rave)
We will rave

When the darkness hits, and we can't be saved (can't be saved)
We rum de dum dum da
We will rave
When our heartѕ are burning, we feel no pain
We rum de dum dum da
We will rave (we will)

We rum de dum dum da
We will rave (we will)
We rum de dum dum da
We will rave (oh-ooh)
We rum de dum dum da
We will rаve
