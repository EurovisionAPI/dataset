Dizzy

There's a place where we break the line
Make it a circle redefined
Beautiful gardens, eternal flowers
You know the way, so take me there

Won't you make me dizzy from your kisses?
Will you take my hand and spin me
'Round and 'round until the moment never ends?
Make me dizzy from your kisses
Will you take my hand and spin me?
Take me back to the beginning again

Pulling me close, I feel a stillness in the air
Time has frozen, all memories lost

So won't you make me dizzy from your kisses?
Will you take my hand and spin me
'Round and 'round until the moment never ends?
Make me dizzy from your kisses
Will you take my hand and spin me?
Take me back to the beginning again

So don't you make me dizzy from, oh…

<i style="color:#789">There isn't an end, there isn't a start
I don't wanna stop, I can't go too far
There isn't an end, there isn't a start
I don't wanna stop, I can't go too far
There isn't an end, there isn't a start
I don't wanna stop, I can't go too far
There isn't an end, there isn't</i>

So won't you make me dizzy from your kisses?
Will you take my hand and spin me
'Round and 'round until the moment never ends?
Make me dizzy from your kisses
Will you take my hand and ѕpin me?
Take me back to the beginning agаin
