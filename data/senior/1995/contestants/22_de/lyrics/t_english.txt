In love with You

Sometimes when I'm helpless
And my belief has lost its way
The grief burns deep inside of me
I'm only hunting after dreams

Is my life endlessly empty?
Finding no more peace
Longing cries – safety
But You are here beside me
Hey...

Do you know this feeling?
You're alone and your soul freezes
It's so difficult to be a human being
Trust in Your angel deep inside of You

Believe me, I'm loyal to You
You are the only reason for that
I feel You near, so near to me
You catch all my tears

Oh Lord, I'm in love with You
Can't restrain myself, can't explain
What happens between heaven and earth
Oh Lord, I'm in love with You
Can't restrain myself, can't explain
Memory stays and tells about You
Only You are the reason for that

Fear, I let you pass away
I recognised you often enough
I know now that nothing can happen to me
I carry a heart full of light inside of me

Silent night, I trust in You
There are no more doubts for me
I can never lose You
A dream becomes true, just with You

Oh Lord, I'm in love with You
Can't restrain myself, can't explain
What happens between heaven and earth
Oh Lord, I'm in love with You
Can't restrain myself, can't explain
Memory stays and tells about You
Only You are the reason for that

You can see my soul
All the light inside me belongs to You

Oh... I'm in love with You
Can't restrain myself, can't explain
What happens between heaven and eаrth
I'm so in love with You (I'm so in love with You)
I'm so in love with You (I'm ѕo in love...)
