Nostalgia

Silent
A silent violin is playing
And touching my heart's chords
Through seas and mountains
It plays to me, it plays

Silent
A silent violin is playing
Like the light of the sky's heights
Paganini plays from the sky
It plays to me, it plays

Nostalgia, nostalgia
Travels through my soul
It bound me with you my entire life
When you're away, she's my home and family
Nostalgia

Nostalgia, nostalgia
Travels through my soul
It bound me with you my entire life
When you're away, she's my home and family
Nostalgia

Silent
A silent violin is playing
And touching my heart's chords
Through seas and mountains
It plays to me, it plays

Nostalgia, nostalgia
Travels through my soul
It bound me with you my entire life
When you're away, she's my home and family
Nostalgia

Nostalgia, nostalgia
Travels through my soul
It bound me with you my entire life
When you're away, she's my home and family
