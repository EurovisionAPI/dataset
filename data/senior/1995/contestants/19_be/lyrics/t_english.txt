The voice is free

The voice is free, free of everything
Everything is possible and we don't give a damn
Balanced on our knees
The voice is free, free of everything

The voice is free, free of everything
Everything is possible and we don't give a damn
Take yourself as target, carry on
The voice is free, free of everything

Free to cry out your dreams
When you wake up in the morning
To imagine that you have a duel with your reflection
Look yourself in the eyes and talk to whom you want
You didn't wake up for nothing, it's fine already

The voice is free, free of everything
Everything is possible and we don't give a damn
Balanced on our knees
The voice is free, free of everything

Free to wipe out your screen
Of those black and bloody pictures
You can change the colours that scare you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...)
When you run down the street, if they didn't recognise you
You didn't cry out loud enough, try again

The voice is free, free of everything
Everything is possible and we don't give a damn
Balanced on our knees
The voice is free, free of everything

The voice is free, free of everything
Everything is possible and you don't give a damn
Each person hаs his own written bible
The voice iѕ free, free of everything
