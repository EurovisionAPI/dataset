The 21st century

You have frozen up the sea, the crazy waves
And hidden the pores, the first sweetest pores from me

Where are you blue-eyed, my life's miserable
Does someone love your heart away from me
I still wear the old jumper you've knitted for me
And forever split my heart

When streets are quiet and tramways asleep
And when the thick fog is swallowing me
Only half the heart is pounding, half's with you
When we give life everything, it eats us alive

The 21st century is coming, my dear
And you're nowhere to be found
The 21st century is coming, my dear
And happiness is nowhere to be found
And happiness is nowhere to be found

The breakfast is in bed, but love is outside it
Farewell with you is most horrific
Your light's still on, like an everlasting lighthouse
Why was I born, when I lose everything I own

When you light up the stars, quietness sings
Do you know how much I miss you
My life is worth nothing
It's decaying, like the old blue jeans

The 21st century is coming, my dear
And you're nowhere to be found
The 21st century is coming, my dear
And happiness is nowhere to be found
And hаppiness iѕ nowhere to be found
