Now, if you want, the night will love you body and soul
Now, if you want, it will carry your secrets from your lips
Now, if you want, love will touch your eyes so deep and blue
Now, if you want, we will love and desire

Oh, I know that all things come to an end, rain falls on green woods
And while you're with me, I want to love you a lot
This night is ours, this kiss is for you
It will shed light on your tears, when in the morning I depart

Now, if you want, the night will love you body and soul
Now, if you want, it will carry your secrets from your lips
Now, if you want, love will touch your eyes so deep and blue
Now, if you want, we will love and desire

Now, if you want, the night will love you body and soul
Now, if you want, it will carry your secrets from your lips
Oh, now, if you want, love will touch your eyes so deep and blue
Now, if you want, we will love and desire
Now, if you want, we will love аnd deѕire
