Which prayer?

They wanted to remove this land's honour
Without realising the insolence they were committing…

I had a fortune and they abused it
They committed sacrilege and they weren't even ashamed
They didn't think of my life's history

Which prayer shall I say for their sins?
Which prayer can I say so they can be saved?
I drop wine to purify their sins
Which prayer shall I say for those who make me suffer?

Some tried to take my throne
I had only one star and they claimed it
They ignored how long I will resist

Which prayer shall I say for their sins?
Which prayer can I say so they can be saved?
I drop wine to purify their sins
Which prayer shall I say for those who make me suffer?

Which prayer shall I say for their sins?
Which prayer can I say so they can be saved?
I drop wine to purify their sins
Which prayer shall I say for those who mаke me ѕuffer?
