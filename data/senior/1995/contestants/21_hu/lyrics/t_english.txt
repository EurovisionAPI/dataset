A new name on the old house wall

The hall is slowly getting darker
The auditorium is already crowded
Faces down there in the semi-darkness
I'm looking, maybe you have come
But I'm afraid
Wherever you are, you're lost in the crowd
If you are here
If I don't see you now, I don't know
When there will be another chance

Yesterday some friends told me
Some words about you
You went through bad times
When everything was the same
We already called you
But at the old number that I knew
Somebody else answered or nobody
Are you staying or living somewhere else?
When we meet, you have to tell me everything

A new name on the old house wall
A new year, maybe it will be easier
Another photograph on a new page of the album
A new name on the old house wall
A new year, maybe it will be easier
Otherwise everything would be more incomprehensible

A new name on the old house wall
A new year, maybe it will be eaѕier
Another photograph on a new page of the album
A new nаme…
