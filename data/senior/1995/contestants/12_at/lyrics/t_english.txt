The world turns the wrong way

Yeah yeah...

Life throws me off course
When you look at me
And then your hand touches me
It's away from the very moment
When your kiss seduced me

Every norm is the same to me
And madness becomes normal

The old world turns the wrong way
Be light like a feather and float away
Gold and platinum will have no value
I'm a millionaire
When you are with me
Laughter and crying unites

Ooh... yeah yeah yeah yeah...

Make a clown out of me
You acrobat without rope
Fly with me through time
Let's build a house out of daydreams
Truth or false
No problems around

Every norm is the same to me
And madness becomes normal
Becomes normal...

(The old world turns the wrong way)
Ah... be light like a feather and float away
Gold and platinum will have no value
I'm a millionaire, and live on it

The old world turns the wrong way
Be light like a feather
When I'm with you
Laughter and crying united

Yeah yeah yeah...
The world turnѕ the wrong wаy
