Listen to me

Listen to me, look at me embraced
Trust me when the night hides you
Admit that you too
Would kiss the sun and dream

You are in me, you're accompanying me in the wind
Now, only your voice is waking up
You're woven in a ray
You're like a night, a touch of stars
You hide, glimmering in me

Let's trust that there is just one sky
You are in it, my traces are within you
Let's confess what we keep in us
Everything is verse, everything is a touch of love

We pray for time
Paths, moments of joy
We plea for this night
This dream of eternity
There's me and you in it

Let's trust that there is just one sky
You are in it, my traces are within you
Let's confess what we keep in us
Everything is verse, everything is a touch of love
Everything is verse, everything iѕ а touch of love
