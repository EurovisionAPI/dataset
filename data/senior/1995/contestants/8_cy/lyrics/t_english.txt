In the fire

I start my path with a shout
And I take my hand to the fire
Wise men's prophecies
Told me that I would be pierced with pins

With my grey uniform I learnt
To love the Holy God
I change the truth
And I walk ahead strongly

And I don't believe yet (I do not stop)
I changed the rules (I will find reasons)
I'm the Greek who fights (Fights)
They said I lost my way (I do not stop)
They opened me paths (I will find reasons)
I remained alone
But I lived again
I lived in the fire

The fire which burns my soul
It's always about to be extinguished
By a bitter honey
Which falls like rain

But I went ahead (I do not stop)
I didn't listen to their words (I will find reasons)
I'm the Greek who goes ahead (Goes ahead)
They told me not to ask (I do not stop)
The told me not to look for reasons (I will find reasons)
I lived alone in the fire (In the fire)

And I don't believe yet (I do not stop)
I changed the rules (I will find reasons)
I'm the Greek who fights (Fights)
They said I lost my way (I do not stop)
They opened me paths (I will find reasons)
I remained alone
But I lived again
I lived in the fire

(I do not stop)
(I will find reasons)
I'm the Greek who fights (Fights)
They said I lost my way (I do not stop)
They opened me paths (I will find reasonѕ)
I remained alone
But I lived agаin
I lived in the fire
