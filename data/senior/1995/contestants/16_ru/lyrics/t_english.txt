Lullaby for a volcano

The valleys sleep deeply, the mountain ash sleeps beside the pond
The rain and the wind are quiet till the next morning

The immense ocean sleeps, only you, unique volcano
Volcanic old man, you are never quiet even for a moment

Listen trustingly to the human voice
Please, turn back to common sense and to joy

Forget forever, volcano, what you have theatened for centuries
Stop to tyrannize the world and stay a green mountain

Forget eternally, volcano, what you have threatened for centuries
Please, turn back to common sense and to joy

Sleep, sullen giant, sleep, eternal guarding volcano
Renounce of war, give us peace and silence

Give peace for the old and the young, also for sinners and saints
Give peace for life on earth, peace for the sky above

Forget eternally, volcano, what you have threatened for centuries
Please, turn back to common sense and to joy

Please, turn back to common senѕe аnd to joy
