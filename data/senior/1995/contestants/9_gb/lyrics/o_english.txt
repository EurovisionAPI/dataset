Love City Groove

We're really makin', we're really makin'
We're really makin', we're really makin'
We're really makin', we're really makin'
We're really makin' love now, uh…

Ooh, baby, you know how I been feelin'
(Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh ooh ooh babe, ooh babe)
Ooh, baby, you know how I been feelin'
(Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh ooh ooh babe, ooh babe)
Uh…

Baby, baby, baby, you got me goin' crazy
I'm feelin' kinda high, my mind is gettin' hazy
But when I think of you, I know just what to do
You make me feel so happy when I'm feelin' blue

You're pickin' me up with a kiss, a touch o' your hand
You're all that I want, you're everything I planned
Like a fairy tale story, you're the man o' my dreams
My knight in shining armour, well, that's how it seems

You greet me in the morning with a kiss and a smile
And for the rest of the day I'm on cloud nine
(Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh ooh ooh babe…)
It may sound like fantasy, but to me, it's real
And I could trust my emotions 'cause I know what I feel

What we have is special, and that it would last
Our hearts beaten as one, it's pumpin' blood real fast
(Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh ooh ooh babe…)
'Cause the connection is truly from above
And I thank God

In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now

Now baby, baby, when I first saw your face
I saw you had flavour and I wanted a taste of this sweet thing
But now there's so much more
'Cause everyday I'm thinkin' about what my baby has in store

Trust and believe, day to day, you never doubt her
'Cause I used to have a dream girl, but now I found her
And she's by my side, she's my pride, my all
Ten foot tall, that's how I feel, I never fall, I never fell

Oh… what the hell, I'll admit it
Love was the target and you hit it
So as I watch you sleep in the middle of the night
You open your eyes and I know it's so right

Two hearts, two minds, two people, one love
And the way you're makin' me feel
It's like you're sent from up above
(Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh ooh ooh babe…)
Your touch, your smell, your face, a unique breed
It's only love but it's all that I need

In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now

We're really makin', we're really makin'
We're really makin', we're really makin'
We're really makin', we're really makin'
We're really makin' love now, uh…

I'm glad that I been found, always wanted you around
Keepin' me lost for words, yeah, I know how that sounds
Now I been to many places and I seen many things
But nothin' that I know can ever make my heart sing like you do
It's like a voodoo, you know what I'm sayin'?
Baby girl, I ain't playin'
I'm glad that I'm the one to rock your world
'Cause honey - yeah…

In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now

In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now
In the mornin' when the sun shineѕ down on your body
I know we're really mаkin' love now
