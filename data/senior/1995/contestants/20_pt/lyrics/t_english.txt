Vanilla and chocolate

Who are these people, yours and mine
Whom had spread roots wherever they went?
They changed the sea, they changed the sky
Where there was no dawn
They made the world their country

Your grandfather was in these parts
My grandmother was here too
Our love is the entire ocean
Your perfume is moonlight
My taste is coffee

My sweetheart with white skin
You are the cream in my dark tea
It's sweeter than honey
A mixture of vanilla and chocolate

A white seagull was found
In those southern lands
Sweet and musical people
Whose tropical singing
Made the dream and the sea blue

Who flavoured our love
Made by the Spanish and Portuguese guitar
In the to-and-fro of caravels
With pepper and cinnamon
With chilli and saffron?

My sweetheart with white skin
You are the cream in my dark tea
It's sweeter than honey
A mixture of vanilla and chocolate

Who were those people who lifted anchor
And rounded Cape Bojador?
Those people who fell under the spell, the challenge
To invent a new love

When hands are joined, a flower is born
And each kiss is blissful peace
When our souls feel love
Whatever the colour of our body
Black or white is of no importance

When our souls feel love
Whatever the colour of our body
Black or white iѕ of no importаnce
