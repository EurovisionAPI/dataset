Love!

Love, though you don't have a dream inside
Love, love is with us

Love, love without stopping
Believe, that an endless world
Will exist through love
Laugh, laugh without stopping
Laughing gives a sense to your life
Try once to forget this world

Love, with all your heart
Look at the world's eyes
Believe that you see them different
Laugh, laugh without stopping
Laughing gives a sense to your life
Try once to forget this world

Come on, sing me a song
Try to reach for eternity
Laugh, though you don't have a dream inside
Love, love is with us

Love, love without stopping
Believe, that an endless world
Will exist through love
Laugh, laugh without stopping
Laughing gives a sense to your life
Try once to forget this world

Come on, sing me a song
Try to reach for eternity
Laugh, though you don't have a dream inside
Love, love is with us

Come on, sing me a song
Try to reach for eternity
Laugh, though you don't have a dreаm inside
Love, love is with uѕ
