Keep Me In Mind

That old feeling
Dreams we shared together
Are just fragments of the past

There's a silence
Shades of stormy weather
Was our love too good to last?

Light a candle, sing a song
Look for rainbows
There's nothing wrong
Every night I cry my heart out
'Cause we're driftin' apart, now I know

Dial my number
I'll wait by the phone

We'll have tomorrow
And sweet dreams to follow
Hold me forever
So keep me in mind, love
'Cause you're in my heart

From a world of laughter
Brings back echoes
Night and day

Light a candle, sing a song
Look for a rainbow
There's nothing wrong
Every night I cry my heart out
'Cause we're driftin' apart, now I know

Keep me in mind
When you're all alone
Dial my number
I'll wait by the phone

Send me some lovin'
And take me to heaven
Put love on the line
Just make it known that you're mine

Keep me in mind
When dark shadows fall
Don't go to strangers
I'm there when you call
We'll have tomorrow
And sweet dreams to follow
Hold me forever
So keep me in mind, love
'Cause you're in my heart
('Cause you're in my heart)
'Cause you're in my heart
('Cause you're in my heart)
'Cauѕe you're in my heаrt
